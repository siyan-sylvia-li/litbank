adventure i
a scandal in bohemia  i
to sherlock holmes she is always the woman
i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler
all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind
he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position
he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer
they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his
and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory
i had seen little of holmes lately
my marriage had drifted us away from each other
my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature
he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland
beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion
one nightit was on the twentieth of march i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street
as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers
his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story
he was at work again
he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem
i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own
his manner was not effusive
it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me
with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner
then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
wedlock suits you he remarked
i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you
seven
i answered
indeed i should have thought a little more
just a trifle more i fancy watson
and in practice again i observe
you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
then how do you know
i see it i deduce it
how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
my dear holmes said i this is too much
you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago
it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i can't imagine how you deduce it
as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out
he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together
it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it
hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey
as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession
i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction
when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process
and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours
quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair
you see but you do not observe
the distinction is clear
for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room
frequently
how often
well some hundreds of times
then how many are there
how many
i don't know
quite so
you have not observed
and yet you have seen
that is just my point
now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed
bytheway since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this
he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table
it came by the last post said he
read it aloud
the note was undated and without either signature or address
there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated
this account of you we have from all quarters received
be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask
this is indeed a mystery i remarked
what do you imagine that it means
i have no data yet
it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data
insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts
but the note itself
what do you deduce from it
i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written
the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
it is peculiarly strong and stiff
peculiarthat is the very word said holmes
it is not an english paper at all
hold it up to the light
i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper
what do you make of that
asked holmes
the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather
not at all
the 'g' with the small 't' stands for 'gesellschaft' which is the german for 'company'
it is a customary contraction like our 'co'
'p' of course stands for 'papier'
now for the 'eg'
let us glance at our continental gazetteer
he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
eglow eglonitzhere we are egria
it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad
'remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills'
ha ha my boy what do you make of that
his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
the paper was made in bohemia i said
precisely
and the man who wrote the note is a german
do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence'this account of you we have from all quarters received'
a frenchman or russian could not have written that
it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs
it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face
and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts
as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell
holmes whistled
a pair by the sound said he
yes he continued glancing out of the window
a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
a hundred and fifty guineas apiece
there's money in this case watson if there is nothing else
i think that i had better go holmes
not a bit doctor
stay where you are
i am lost without my boswell
and this promises to be interesting
it would be a pity to miss it
but your client  never mind him
i may want your help and so may he
here he comes
sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention
a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door
then there was a loud and authoritative tap
come in
said holmes
a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules
his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste
heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl
boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance
he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered
from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy
you had my note
he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent
i told you that i would call
he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address
pray take a seat said holmes
this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases
whom have i the honour to address
you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman
i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone
i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair
it is both or none said he
you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me
the count shrugged his broad shoulders
then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance
at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history
i promise said holmes
and i
you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor
the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own
i was aware of it said holmes dryly
the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe
to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia
i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes
our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe
holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client
if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you
the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground
you are right he cried i am the king
why should i attempt to conceal it
why indeed
murmured holmes
your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia
but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person
yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power
i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you
then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more
the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler
the name is no doubt familiar to you
kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes
for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information
in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes
let me see
said holmes
hum
born in new jersey in the year 
contraltohum
la scala hum
prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes
retired from operatic stageha
living in londonquite so
your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back
precisely so
but how  was there a secret marriage
none
no legal papers or certificates
none
then i fail to follow your majesty
if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity
there is the writing
pooh pooh
forgery
my private notepaper
stolen
my own seal
imitated
my photograph
bought
we were both in the photograph
oh dear
that is very bad
your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
i was madinsane
you have compromised yourself seriously
i was only crown prince then
i was young
i am but thirty now
it must be recovered
we have tried and failed
your majesty must pay
it must be bought
she will not sell
stolen then
five attempts have been made
twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
once we diverted her luggage when she travelled
twice she has been waylaid
there has been no result
no sign of it
absolutely none
holmes laughed
it is quite a pretty little problem said he
but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully
very indeed
and what does she propose to do with the photograph
to ruin me
but how
i am about to be married
so i have heard
to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia
you may know the strict principles of her family
she is herself the very soul of delicacy
a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
and irene adler
threatens to send them the photograph
and she will do it
i know that she will do it
you do not know her but she has a soul of steel
she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men
rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone
you are sure that she has not sent it yet
i am sure
and why
because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
that will be next monday
oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn
that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present
your majesty will of course stay in london for the present
certainly
you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm
then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
pray do so
i shall be all anxiety
then as to money
you have carte blanche
absolutely
i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
and for present expenses
the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table
there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said
holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him
and mademoiselle's address
he asked
is briony lodge serpentine avenue st john's wood
holmes took a note of it
one other question said he
was the photograph a cabinet
it was
then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you
and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you
ii
at three o'clock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned
the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be
i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own
indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head
it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room
accustomed as i was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he
with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old
putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes
well really
he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair
what is it
it's quite too funny
i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing
i can't imagine
i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler
quite so but the sequel was rather unusual
i will tell you however
i left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men
be one of them and you will know all that there is to know
i soon found briony lodge
it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories
chubb lock to the door
large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open
behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse
i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest
i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden
i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to
and what of irene adler
i asked
oh she has turned all the men's heads down in that part
she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet
so say the serpentinemews to a man
she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner
seldom goes out at other times except when she sings
has only one male visitor but a good deal of him
he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice
he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple
see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him
when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign
this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
he was a lawyer
that sounded ominous
what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits
was she his client his friend or his mistress
if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
if the latter it was less likely
on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the temple
it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry
i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation
i am following you closely i answered
i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out
he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard
he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home
he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms
of her i could see nothing
presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before
as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly 'drive like the devil' he shouted 'first to gross  hankey's in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road
half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes'
away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
it hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it
i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for
'the church of st monica john' she cried 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes'
this was quite too good to lose watson
i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street
the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object
'the church of st monica' said i 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes'
it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind
my cabby drove fast
i don't think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us
the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived
i paid the man and hurried into the church
there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them
they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar
i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church
suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me
'thank god' he cried
'you'll do
come
come'
'what then'
i asked
'come man come only three minutes or it won't be legal'
i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor
it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front
it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now
it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watchchain in memory of the occasion
this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then
well i found my plans very seriously menaced
it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part
at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house
'i shall drive out in the park at five as usual' she said as she left him
i heard no more
they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements
which are
some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell
i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening
by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation
i shall be delighted
you don't mind breaking the law
not in the least
nor running a chance of arrest
not in a good cause
oh the cause is excellent
then i am your man
i was sure that i might rely on you
but what is it you wish
when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you
now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time
it is nearly five now
in two hours we must be on the scene of action
miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven
we must be at briony lodge to meet her
and what then
you must leave that to me
i have already arranged what is to occur
there is only one point on which i must insist
you must not interfere come what may
you understand
i am to be neutral
to do nothing whatever
there will probably be some small unpleasantness
do not join in it
it will end in my being conveyed into the house
four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open
you are to station yourself close to that open window
yes
you are to watch me for i will be visible to you
yes
and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire
you quite follow me
entirely
it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket
it is an ordinary plumber's smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting
your task is confined to that
when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people
you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes
i hope that i have made myself clear
i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street
precisely
then you may entirely rely on me
that is excellent
i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play
he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman
his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled
it was not merely that holmes changed his costume
his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed
the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime
it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue
it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant
the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes' succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected
on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated
there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters
the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now
the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess
now the question is where are we to find the photograph
where indeed
it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her
it is cabinet size
too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress
she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched
two attempts of the sort have already been made
we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
where then
her banker or her lawyer
there is that double possibility
but i am inclined to think neither
women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting
why should she hand it over to anyone else
she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man
besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days
it must be where she can lay her hands upon it
it must be in her own house
but it has twice been burgled
pshaw
they did not know how to look
but how will you look
i will not look
what then
i will get her to show me
but she will refuse
she will not be able to
but i hear the rumble of wheels
it is her carriage
now carry out my orders to the letter
as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue
it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge
as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention
a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side
a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks
holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face
at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of betterdressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man
irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street
is the poor gentleman much hurt
she asked
he is dead cried several voices
no no there's life in him
shouted another
but he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital
he's a brave fellow said a woman
they would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him
they were a gang and a rough one too
ah he's breathing now
he can't lie in the street
may we bring him in marm
surely
bring him into the sittingroom
there is a comfortable sofa
this way please
slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window
the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch
i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man
and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me
i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster
after all i thought we are not injuring her
we are but preventing her from injuring another
holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air
a maid rushed across and threw open the window
at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire
the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servantmaidsjoined in a general shriek of fire
thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window
i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm
slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar
he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road
you did it very nicely doctor he remarked
nothing could have been better
it is all right
you have the photograph
i know where it is
and how did you find out
she showed me as i told you she would
i am still in the dark
i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing
the matter was perfectly simple
you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice
they were all engaged for the evening
i guessed as much
then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle
it is an old trick
that also i could fathom
then they carried me in
she was bound to have me in
what else could she do
and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected
it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which
they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
how did that help you
it was allimportant
when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most
it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it
in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business
a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox
now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of
she would rush to secure it
the alarm of fire was admirably done
the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel
she responded beautifully
the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull
she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out
when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since
i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house
i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait
a little overprecipitance may ruin all
and now
i asked
our quest is practically finished
i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us
we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph
it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands
and when will you call
at eight in the morning
she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field
besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
i must wire to the king without delay
we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door
he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said  goodnight mister sherlock holmes
there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by
i've heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street
now i wonder who the deuce that could have been
iii
i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room
you have really got it
he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face
not yet
but you have hopes
i have hopes
then come
i am all impatience to be gone
we must have a cab
no my brougham is waiting
then that will simplify matters
we descended and started off once more for briony lodge
irene adler is married remarked holmes
married
when
yesterday
but to whom
to an english lawyer named norton
but she could not love him
i am in hopes that she does
and why in hopes
because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance
if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty
if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty's plan
it is true
and yetwell
i wish she had been of my own station
what a queen she would have made
he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue
the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps
she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham
mr sherlock holmes i believe
said she
i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze
indeed
my mistress told me that you were likely to call
she left this morning with her husband by the  train from charing cross for the continent
what
sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise
do you mean that she has left england
never to return
and the papers
asked the king hoarsely
all is lost
we shall see
he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself
the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight
holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter
the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq
to be left till called for
my friend tore it open and we all three read it together
it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way  my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well
you took me in completely
until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion
but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think
i had been warned against you months ago
i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you
and your address had been given me
yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know
even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman
but you know i have been trained as an actress myself
male costume is nothing new to me
i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives
i sent john the coachman to watch you ran up stairs got into my walkingclothes as i call them and came down just as you departed
well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes
then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the temple to see my husband
we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow
as to the photograph your client may rest in peace
i love and am loved by a better man than he
the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged
i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future
i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes                                        very truly yours                                    irene norton ne adler
what a womanoh what a woman
cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle
did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was
would she not have made an admirable queen
is it not a pity that she was not on my level
from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly
i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful
i know that her word is inviolate
the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire
i am glad to hear your majesty say so
i am immensely indebted to you
pray tell me in what way i can reward you
this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand
your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes
you have but to name it
this photograph
the king stared at him in amazement
irene's photograph
he cried
certainly if you wish it
i thank your majesty
then there is no more to be done in the matter
i have the honour to wish you a very goodmorning
he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers
and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late
and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman
adventure ii
the redheaded league  i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me
you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially
i was afraid that you were engaged
so i am
very much so
then i can wait in the next room
not at all
this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes
try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods
i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures
your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed
you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination
a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting
you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right
now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time
you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed
as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to
perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative
i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips
as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory
in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique
the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance
i did not gain very much however by my inspection
our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow
he wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features
sherlock holmes' quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else
mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion
how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr
holmes
he asked
how did you know for example that i did manual labour
it's as true as gospel for i began as a ship's carpenter
your hands my dear sir
your right hand is quite a size larger than your left
you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed
well the snuff then and the freemasonry
i won't insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin
ah of course i forgot that
but the writing
what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk
well but china
the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china
i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject
that trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china
when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple
mr jabez wilson laughed heavily
well i never
said he
i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all
i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining
'omne ignotum pro magnifico' you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid
can you not find the advertisement mr
wilson
yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
here it is
this is what began it all
you just read it for yourself sir
i took the paper from him and read as follows  to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of  pounds a week for purely nominal services
all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible
apply in person on monday at eleven o'clock to duncan ross at the offices of the league  pope's court fleet street
what on earth does this mean
i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits
it is a little off the beaten track isn't it
said he
and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes
you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date
it is the morning chronicle of april  
just two months ago
very good
now mr
wilson
well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbroker's business at coburg square near the city
it's not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living
i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business
what is the name of this obliging youth
asked sherlock holmes
his name is vincent spaulding and he's not such a youth either
it's hard to say his age
i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him
but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head
why indeed
you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price
it is not a common experience among employers in this age
i don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement
oh he has his faults too said mr wilson
never was such a fellow for photography
snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures
that is his main fault but on the whole he's a good worker
there's no vice in him
he is still with you i presume
yes sir
he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthat's all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family
we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more
the first thing that put us out was that advertisement
spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says  'i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man'
'why that'
i asks
'why' says he 'here's another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men
it's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money
if my hair would only change colour here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into'
'why what is it then'
i asked
you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat
in that way i didn't know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news
'have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men'
he asked with his eyes open
'never'
'why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies'
'and what are they worth'
i asked
'oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations'
well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been overgood for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
'tell me all about it' said i
'well' said he showing me the advertisement 'you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars
as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways
he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour
from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do'
'but' said i 'there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply'
'not so many as you might think' he answered
'you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men
this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn
then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red
now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds'
now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met
vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me
he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement
i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes
from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement
fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and pope's court looked like a coster's orange barrow
i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement
every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint
when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it
how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office
there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office
your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
pray continue your very interesting statement
there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine
he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them
getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all
however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us
'this is mr jabez wilson' said my assistant 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league'
'and he is admirably suited for it' the other answered
'he has every requirement
i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine'
he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful
then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success
'it would be injustice to hesitate' said he
'you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution'
with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain
'there is water in your eyes' said he as he released me
'i perceive that all is as it should be
but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint
i could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature'
he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled
a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager
'my name' said he 'is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
are you a married man mr wilson
have you a family'
i answered that i had not
his face fell immediately
'dear me'
he said gravely 'that is very serious indeed
i am sorry to hear you say that
the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance
it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor'
my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right
'in the case of another' said he 'the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties'
'well it is a little awkward for i have a business already' said i
'oh never mind about that mr
wilson'
said vincent spaulding
'i should be able to look after that for you'
'what would be the hours'
i asked
'ten to two'
now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings
besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up
'that would suit me very well' said i
'and the pay'
'is  pounds a week'
'and the work'
'is purely nominal'
'what do you call purely nominal'
'well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time
if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever
the will is very clear upon that point
you don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time'
'it's only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving' said i
'no excuse will avail' said mr duncan ross 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else
there you must stay or you lose your billet'
'and the work'
'is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica
there is the first volume of it in that press
you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair
will you be ready tomorrow'
'certainly' i answered
'then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain'
he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune
well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine
it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'encyclopaedia britannica'
vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for pope's court
well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible
the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work
he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me
at two o'clock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me
this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
it was the same next week and the same the week after
every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two
by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all
still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it
eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b's before very long
it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
and then suddenly the whole business came to an end
to an end
yes sir
and no later than this morning
i went to my work as usual at ten o'clock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
here it is and you can read for yourself
he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper
it read in this fashion                    the redheaded league                             is                          dissolved
october  
sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter
i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere
no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen
i really wouldn't miss your case for the world
it is most refreshingly unusual
but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it
pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door
i was staggered sir
i did not know what to do
then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it
finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the groundfloor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league
he said that he had never heard of any such body
then i asked him who mr duncan ross was
he answered that the name was new to him
'well' said i 'the gentleman at no
'
'what the redheaded man'
'yes'
'oh' said he 'his name was william morris
he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready
he moved out yesterday'
'where could i find him'
'oh at his new offices
he did tell me the address
yes  king edward street near st
paul's'
i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross
and what did you do then
asked holmes
i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant
but he could not help me in any way
he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post
but that was not quite good enough mr holmes
i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you
and you did very wisely said holmes
your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it
from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear
grave enough
said mr jabez wilson
why i have lost four pound a week
as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some  pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a
you have lost nothing by them
no sir
but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me
it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds
we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
and first one or two questions mr wilson
this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you
about a month then
how did he come
in answer to an advertisement
was he the only applicant
no i had a dozen
why did you pick him
because he was handy and would come cheap
at halfwages in fact
yes
what is he like this vincent spaulding
small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though he's not short of thirty
has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
i thought as much said he
have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings
yes sir
he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad
hum
said holmes sinking back in deep thought
he is still with you
oh yes sir i have only just left him
and has your business been attended to in your absence
nothing to complain of sir
there's never very much to do of a morning
that will do mr wilson
i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion
well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all
i make nothing of it i answered frankly
it is a most mysterious business
as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be
it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify
but i must be prompt over this matter
what are you going to do then
i asked
to smoke he answered
it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird
i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
sarasate plays at the st james's hall this afternoon he remarked
what do you think watson
could your patients spare you for a few hours
i have nothing to do today
my practice is never very absorbing
then put on your hat and come
i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way
i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french
it is introspective and i want to introspect
come along
we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning
it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurelbushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere
three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business
sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses
finally he returned to the pawnbroker's and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked
it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in
thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand
third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door
smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away
he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third
i have known something of him before
evidently said i mr wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league
i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him
not him
what then
the knees of his trousers
and what did you see
what i expected to see
why did you beat the pavement
my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk
we are spies in an enemy's country
we know something of saxecoburg square
let us now explore the parts which lie behind it
the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back
it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west
the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted
let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here
it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london
there is mortimer's the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlane's carriagebuilding depot
that carries us right on to the other block
and now doctor we've done our work so it's time we had some play
a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums
my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit
all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive
in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him
the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions
then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals
when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down
you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged
yes it would be as well
and i have some business to do which will take some hours
this business at coburg square is serious
why serious
a considerable crime is in contemplation
i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it
but today being saturday rather complicates matters
i shall want your help tonight
at what time
ten will be early enough
i shall be at baker street at ten
very well
and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd
i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes
here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque
as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me
what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed
where were we going and what were we to do
i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game
i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation
it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street
two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above
on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat
ha
our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard
let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonight's adventure
we're hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way
our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase
all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down
i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily
you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily
he has his own little methods which are if he won't mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him
it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force
oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference
still i confess that i miss my rubber
it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber
i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting
for you mr merryweather the stake will be some  pounds and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands
john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger
he's a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london
he's a remarkable man is young john clay
his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford
his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself
he'll crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next
i've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet
i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight
i've had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession
it is past ten however and quite time that we started
if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second
sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon
we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street
we are close there now my friend remarked
this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter
i thought it as well to have jones with us also
he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession
he has one positive virtue
he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone
here we are and they are waiting for us
we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning
our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us
within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate
this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate
mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor
why dear me it sounds quite hollow
he remarked looking up in surprise
i must really ask you to be a little more quiet
said holmes severely
you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere
the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket
we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed
then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape
we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks
mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
it is our french gold whispered the director
we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
your french gold
yes
we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose  napoleons from the bank of france
it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar
the crate upon which i sit contains  napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
which were very well justified observed holmes
and now it is time that we arranged our little plans
i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head
in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern
and sit in the dark
i am afraid so
i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carre you might have your rubber after all
but i see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light
and first of all we must choose our positions
these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful
i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those
then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly
if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down
i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched
holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced
the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment's notice
to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault
they have but one retreat whispered holmes
that is back through the house into saxecoburg square
i hope that you have done what i asked you jones
i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
then we have stopped all the holes
and now we must be silent and wait
what a time it seemed
from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us
my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director
from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor
suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light
for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor
then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones
its disappearance however was but momentary
with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern
over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge
in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
it's all clear he whispered
have you the chisel and the bags
great scott
jump archie jump and i'll swing for it
sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar
the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts
the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
it's no use john clay said holmes blandly
you have no chance at all
so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness
i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails
there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes
oh indeed
you seem to have done the thing very completely
i must compliment you
and i you holmes answered
your redheaded idea was very new and effective
you'll see your pal again presently said jones
he's quicker at climbing down holes than i am
just hold out while i fix the derbies
i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins
have the goodness also when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please'
all right said jones with a stare and a snigger
well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation
that is better said john clay serenely
he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you
there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience
i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes
i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league
you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the 'encyclopaedia' must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better
the method was no doubt suggested to clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair
the  pounds a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands
they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation
but how could you guess what the motive was
had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
that however was out of the question
the man's business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at
it must then be something out of the house
what could it be
i thought of the assistant's fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar
the cellar
there was the end of this tangled clue
then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london
he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end
what could it be once more
i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building
so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action
i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick
i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind
it was not in front
then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it
we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before
i hardly looked at his face
his knees were what i wished to see
you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were
they spoke of those hours of burrowing
the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for
i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend's premises and felt that i had solved my problem
when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen
and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight
i asked
well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilson's presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel
but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed
saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape
for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight
you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true
it saved me from ennui he answered yawning
alas
i already feel it closing in upon me
my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence
these little problems help me to do so
and you are a benefactor of the race said i
he shrugged his shoulders
well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked
'l'homme c'est rienl'oeuvre c'est tout' as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand
adventure iii
a case of identity  my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent
we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence
if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
and yet i am not convinced of it i answered
the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough
we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic
a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes
this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace
i smiled and shook my head
i can quite understand your thinking so i said
of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre
but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test
here is the first heading upon which i come
'a husband's cruelty to his wife'
there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me
there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady
the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it
this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it
the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller
take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example
he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it
ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks
it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers
and the ring
i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger
it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems
and have you any on hand just now
i asked with interest
some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest
they are important you understand without being interesting
indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation
the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive
in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest
it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken
he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street
looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear
from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell
i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire
oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication
and yet even here we may discriminate
when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved
but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts
as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat
sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him
do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting
i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking
then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face
you've heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that
never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things
perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook
if not why should you come to consult me
i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead
oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me
i'm not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel
why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling
again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland
yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all
he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you
your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different
yes my stepfather
i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself
and your mother is alive
oh yes mother is alive and well
i wasn't best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after father's death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself
father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines
they got  pounds for the goodwill and interest which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive
i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
your own little income he asked does it come out of the business
oh no sir
it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland
it is in new zealand stock paying   per cent
two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest
you interest me extremely said holmes
and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way
i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about  pounds
i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i don't wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them
of course that is only just for the time
mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting
it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
you have made your position very clear to me said holmes
this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself
kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel
a flush stole over miss sutherland's face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
i met him first at the gasfitters' ball she said
they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother
mr windibank did not wish us to go
he never did wish us to go anywhere
he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sundayschool treat
but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent
he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all father's friends were to be there
and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer
at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel
i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball
oh well he was very good about it
he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way
i see
then at the gasfitters' ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel
yes sir
i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more
no
well you know father didn't like anything of the sort
he wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle
but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet
but how about mr hosmer angel
did he make no attempt to see you
well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone
we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day
i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know
were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
oh yes mr holmes
we were engaged after the first walk that we took
hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand  what office
that's the worst of it mr holmes i don't know
where did he live then
he slept on the premises
and you don't know his address
noexcept that it was leadenhall street
where did you address your letters then
to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for
he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldn't have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us
that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of
it was most suggestive said holmes
it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important
can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel
he was a very shy man mr holmes
he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous
very retiring and gentlemanly he was
even his voice was gentle
he'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech
he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare
well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france
mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back
he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him
mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion
mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was
then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him
i didn't quite like that mr holmes
it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didn't want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
it missed him then
yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived
ha
that was unfortunate
your wedding was arranged then for the friday
was it to be in church
yes sir but very quietly
it was to be at st saviour's near king's cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel
hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street
we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there
the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him
it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes
oh no sir
he was too good and kind to leave me so
why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later
it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it
most certainly it does
your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
yes sir
i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so
and then i think that what he foresaw happened
but you have no notion as to what it could have been
none
one more question
how did your mother take the matter
she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again
and your father
did you tell him
yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again
as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me
now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine
and yet what could have happened
and why could he not write
oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i can't sleep a wink at night
she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it
i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result
let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further
above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life
then you don't think i'll see him again
i fear not
then what has happened to him
you will leave that question in my hands
i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
i advertised for him in last saturday's chronicle said she
here is the slip and here are four letters from him
thank you
and your address
no
 lyon place camberwell
mr angel's address you never had i understand
where is your father's place of business
he travels for westhouse  marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street
thank you
you have made your statement very clearly
you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you
let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life
you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that
i shall be true to hosmer
he shall find me ready when he comes back
for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect
she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned
sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face
quite an interesting study that maiden he observed
i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one
you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in ' and there was something of the sort at the hague last year
old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me
but the maiden herself was most instructive
you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked
not invisible but unnoticed watson
you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important
i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace
now what did you gather from that woman's appearance
describe it
well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red
her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments
her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger
her boots i didn't observe
she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way
sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled
'pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully
you have really done very well indeed
it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour
never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details
my first glance is always at a woman's sleeve
in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser
as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces
the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined
the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was
i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her
it surprised me
but surely it was obvious
i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one
one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth
now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry
and what else
i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friend's incisive reasoning
i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed
you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink
she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep
it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson
would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel
i held the little printed slip to the light
missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel
about five ft seven in
in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech
was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots
known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street
anybody bringing  that will do said holmes
as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace
absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once
there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you
they are typewritten i remarked
not only that but the signature is typewritten
look at the neat little 'hosmer angel' at the bottom
there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague
the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive
of what
my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case
i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted
no that was not the point
however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter
one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young lady's stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening
it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives
and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom
once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel
i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland
a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer
it was not until close upon six o'clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the dnouement of the little mystery
i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him
well have you solved it
i asked as i entered
yes
it was the bisulphate of baryta
no no the mystery
i cried
oh that
i thought of the salt that i have been working upon
there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest
the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel
who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland
the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
this is the girl's stepfather mr james windibank said holmes
he has written to me to say that he would be here at six
come in
the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
goodevening mr james windibank said holmes
i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock
yes sir
i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know
i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public
it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point
of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad
besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel
on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel
mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves
i am delighted to hear it he said
it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting
unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike
some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side
now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r'
there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious
we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes
and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued
i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime
it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention
i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man
they are all typewritten
in each case not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well
mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat
i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said
if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it
certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door
i let you know then that i have caught him
what
where
shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap
oh it won't doreally it won't said holmes suavely
there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank
it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question
that's right
sit down and let us talk it over
our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
itit's not actionable he stammered
i am very much afraid that it is not
but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me
now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong
the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed
holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us
the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them
it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference
it was worth an effort to preserve it
the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long
now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it
he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age
but soon he found that that would not answer forever
she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball
what does her clever stepfather do then
he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart
with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself
it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor
we never thought that she would have been so carried away
very likely not
however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind
she was flattered by the gentleman's attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced
there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else
but the deception could not be kept up forever
these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous
the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come
hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man
as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other
i think that was the chain of events mr
windibank
our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me
i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more
if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
by jove
he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face it is not part of my duties to my client but here's a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
there's a coldblooded scoundrel
said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more
that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows
the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest
i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked
well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather
then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive
so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers
my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it
you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction
and how did you verify them
having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration
i knew the firm for which this man worked
having taken the printed description
i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers
i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here
as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects
the same post brought me a letter from westhouse  marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ james windibank
voil tout
and miss sutherland
if i tell her she will not believe me
you may remember the old persian saying 'there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman'
there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world
adventure iv
the boscombe valley mystery  we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram
it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way  have you a couple of days to spare
have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy
shall be glad if you will come with me
air and scenery perfect
leave paddington by the 
what do you say dear
said my wife looking across at me
will you go
i really don't know what to say
i have a fairly long list at present
oh anstruther would do your work for you
you have been looking a little pale lately
i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes' cases
i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered
but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour
my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller
my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station
sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap
it is really very good of you to come watson said he
it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely
local aid is always either worthless or else biassed
if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets
we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him
among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading
then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack
have you heard anything of the case
he asked
not a word
i have not seen a paper for some days
the london press has not had very full accounts
i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars
it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
that sounds a little paradoxical
but it is profoundly true
singularity is almost invariably a clue
the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home
in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
it is a murder then
well it is conjectured to be so
i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it
i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words
boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire
the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country
one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian
the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together
mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living
they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood
mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl
turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least
that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families
now for the facts
on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley
he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three
from that appointment he never came back alive
from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground
one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner
both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone
the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm
to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him
he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred
the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them
the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge
a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers
she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel
she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father
she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight
she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper
he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood
on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool
the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon
the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his son's gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body
under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes
those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt
i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked
if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here
circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully
it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit
there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest
lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case
there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing
besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade
you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding
to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that
how on earth  my dear fellow i know you well
i know the military neatness which characterises you
you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other
i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result
i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
therein lies my mtier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us
there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering
what are they
it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm
on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
it was a confession i ejaculated
no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds
however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him
had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness
as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him
the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one
i shook my head
many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked
so they have
and many men have been wrongfully hanged
what is the young man's own account of the matter
it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself
he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred
i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully
it ran in this way  mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows 'i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the rd
my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom
shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going
i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side
on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father
i had no idea that he was in front of me
when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee
which was a usual signal between my father and myself
i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool
he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there
a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper
seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm
i had not gone more than  yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again
i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured
i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired
i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turner's lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance
i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries
he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies
i know nothing further of the matter'
the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died
witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat
the coroner what did you understand by that
witness it conveyed no meaning to me
i thought that he was delirious
the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel
witness i should prefer not to answer
the coroner i am afraid that i must press it
witness it is really impossible for me to tell you
i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed
the coroner that is for the court to decide
i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise
witness i must still refuse
the coroner i understand that the cry of 'cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
witness it was
the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol
witness with considerable confusion i do not know
a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured
witness nothing definite
the coroner what do you mean
witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father
yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps
when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone
'do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help'
'yes it was gone'
'you cannot say what it was'
'no i had a feeling something was there'
'how far from the body'
'a dozen yards or so'
'and how far from the edge of the wood'
'about the same'
'then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it'
'yes but with my back towards it'
this concluded the examination of the witness
i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his father's dying words
they are all as he remarks very much against the son
holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little
too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth
no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us
and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action
we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
it was nearly four o'clock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross
a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform
in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard
with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us
i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered
it is entirely a question of barometric pressure
lestrade looked startled
i do not quite follow he said
how is the glass
twentynine i see
no wind and not a cloud in the sky
i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight
lestrade laughed indulgently
you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said
the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes
still of course one can't refuse a lady and such a very positive one too
she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done
why bless my soul
here is her carriage at the door
he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life
her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
oh mr sherlock holmes
she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a woman's quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come
i have driven down to tell you so
i know that james didn't do it
i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too
never let yourself doubt upon that point
we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly
such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my doing all that i can
but you have read the evidence
you have formed some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw
do you not yourself think that he is innocent
i think that it is very probable
there now
she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade
you hear
he gives me hopes
lestrade shrugged his shoulders
i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said
but he is right
oh
i know that he is right
james never did it
and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it
in what way
asked holmes
it is no time for me to hide anything
james and his father had many disagreements about me
mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us
james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet
so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them
and your father
asked holmes
was he in favour of such a union
no he was averse to it also
no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it
a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her
thank you for this information said he
may i see your father if i call tomorrow
i am afraid the doctor won't allow it
the doctor
yes have you not heard
poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely
he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered
mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria
ha
in victoria
that is important
yes at the mines
quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money
yes certainly
thank you miss turner
you have been of material assistance to me
you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow
no doubt you will go to the prison to see james
oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
i will miss turner
i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him
goodbye and god help you in your undertaking
she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint
i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel
i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes
have you an order to see him in prison
yes but only for you and me
then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out
we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight
ample
then let us do so
watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel
the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade
it was something terrible and deadly
what could it be
might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest
in the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
i marked the spot upon my own head
clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father
still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell
still it might be worth while to call holmes' attention to it
then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
what could that mean
it could not be delirium
a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate
but what could it indicate
i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation
and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy
if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was
i did not wonder at lestrade's opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes' insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy's innocence
it was late before sherlock holmes returned
he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground
on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey
i have seen young mccarthy
and what did you learn from him
nothing
could he throw no light
none at all
i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else
he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner
ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale
this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office
no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible
it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner
on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was
mark that point
it is of importance
good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them
i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered
but if he is innocent who has done it
ah
who
i would call your attention very particularly to two points
one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return
the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'cooee'
before he knew that his son had returned
those are the crucial points upon which the case depends
and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow
there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless
at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool
there is serious news this morning lestrade observed
it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of
an elderly man i presume
said holmes
about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time
this business has had a very bad effect upon him
he was an old friend of mccarthy's and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free
indeed
that is interesting said holmes
oh yes
in a hundred other ways he has helped him
everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
really
does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turner's daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow
it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea
the daughter told us as much
do you not deduce something from that
we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me
i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies
you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts
anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth
and that is  that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing
but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left
yes that is it
it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
we called at the door when the maid at holmes' request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son's though not the pair which he had then had
having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool
sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this
men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him
his face flushed and darkened
his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck
his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply
swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool
it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side
sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling
on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake
lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man
to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass
he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion
what did you go into the pool for
he asked
i fished about with a rake
i thought there might be some weapon or other trace
but how on earth  oh tut tut
i have no time
that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place
a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds
oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it
here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body
but here are three separate tracks of the same feet
he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us
these are young mccarthy's feet
twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible
that bears out his story
he ran when he saw his father on the ground
then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down
what is this then
it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening
and this
ha ha
what have we here
tiptoes
tiptoes
square too quite unusual boots
they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak
now where did they come from
he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood
holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach
a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained
then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost
it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner
i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge
i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note
having done that we may drive back to our luncheon
you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently
it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood
this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out
the murder was done with it
i see no marks
there are none
how do you know then
the grass was growing under it
it had only lain there a few days
there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken
it corresponds with the injuries
there is no sign of any other weapon
and the murderer
is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket
there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
lestrade laughed
i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said
theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury
nous verrons answered holmes calmly
you work your own method and i shall work mine
i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train
and leave your case unfinished
no finished
but the mystery
it is solved
who was the criminal then
the gentleman i describe
but who is he
surely it would not be difficult to find out
this is not such a populous neighbourhood
lestrade shrugged his shoulders
i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg
i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard
all right said holmes quietly
i have given you the chance
here are your lodgings
goodbye
i shall drop you a line before i leave
having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table
holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position
look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little
i don't know quite what to do and i should value your advice
light a cigar and let me expound
pray do so
well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him
one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry 'cooee'
before seeing him
the other was his singular dying reference to a rat
he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the son's ear
now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
what of this 'cooee'
then
well obviously it could not have been meant for the son
the son as far as he knew was in bristol
it was mere chance that he was within earshot
the 'cooee'
was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with
but 'cooee' is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians
there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia
what of the rat then
sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table
this is a map of the colony of victoria he said
i wired to bristol for it last night
he put his hand over part of the map
what do you read
arat i read
and now
he raised his hand
ballarat
quite so
that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables
he was trying to utter the name of his murderer
so and so of ballarat
it is wonderful
i exclaimed
it is obvious
and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably
the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the son's statement to be correct was a certainty
we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak
certainly
and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
quite so
then comes our expedition of today
by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
but how did you gain them
you know my method
it is founded upon the observation of trifles
his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
his boots too might be told from their traces
yes they were peculiar boots
but his lameness
the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left
he put less weight upon it
why
because he limpedhe was lame
but his lefthandedness
you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side
now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man
he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son
he had even smoked there
i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar
i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of  different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco
having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it
it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam
and the cigarholder
i could see that the end had not been in his mouth
therefore he used a holder
the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife
holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him
i see the direction in which all this points
the culprit is  mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor
the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure
his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character
his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently
you had my note
yes the lodgekeeper brought it up
you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
i thought people would talk if i went to the hall
and why did you wish to see me
he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered
yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words
it is so
i know all about mccarthy
the old man sank his face in his hands
god help me
he cried
but i would not have let the young man come to harm
i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes
i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely
i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl
it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested
it may not come to that said holmes
what
i am no official agent
i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests
young mccarthy must be got off however
i am a dying man said old turner
i have had diabetes for years
my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month
yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol
holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him
just tell us the truth he said
i shall jot down the facts
you will sign it and watson here can witness it
then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy
i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed
it's as well said the old man it's a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock
and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell
you didn't know this dead man mccarthy
he was a devil incarnate
i tell you that
god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he
his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life
i'll tell you first how i came to be in his power
it was in the early ''s at the diggings
i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber
there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang
one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it
there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley
three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag
i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy
i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature
we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected
there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life
i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it
i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice
even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done
in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past
all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me
i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
'here we are jack' says he touching me on the arm 'we'll be as good as a family to you
there's two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us
if you don'tit's a fine lawabiding country is england and there's always a policeman within hail'
well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since
there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow
it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police
whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give
he asked for alice
his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property
but there i was firm
i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough
i stood firm
mccarthy threatened
i braved him to do his worst
we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over
when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone
but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost
he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets
it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this
could i not snap the bond
i was already a dying and a desperate man
though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed
but my memory and my girl
both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue
i did it mr holmes
i would do it again
deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it
but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer
i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast
his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight
that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred
well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out
i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation
i pray not sir
and what do you intend to do
in view of your health nothing
you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes
i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it
if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
farewell then said the old man solemnly
your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine
tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room
god help us
said holmes after a long silence
why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms
i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter's words and say 'there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes'
james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel
old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
adventure v the five orange pips  when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years ' and ' i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave
some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate
some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him
there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up
the year ' furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records
among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case
in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead man's watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case
all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe
it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence
all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage
as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney
sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell's fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves
my wife was on a visit to her mother's and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street
why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell
who could come tonight
some friend of yours perhaps
except yourself i have none he answered
i do not encourage visitors
a client then
if so it is a serious case
nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour
but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's
sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door
he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit
come in
said he
the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing
the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come
he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety
i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes
i trust that i am not intruding
i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
give me your coat and umbrella said holmes
they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently
you have come up from the southwest i see
yes from horsham
that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
i have come for advice
that is easily got
and help
that is not always so easy
i have heard of you mr holmes
i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal
ah of course
he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
he said that you could solve anything
he said too much
that you are never beaten
i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman
but what is that compared with the number of your successes
it is true that i have been generally successful
then you may be so with me
i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
it is no ordinary one
none of those which come to me are
i am the last court of appeal
and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
you fill me with interest said holmes
pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business
it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair
you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph
my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling
he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well
at the time of the war he fought in jackson's army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel
when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years
about  or  he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them
he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition
during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town
he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room
he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother
he didn't mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so
this would be in the year  after he had been eight or nine years in england
he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way
when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house
i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy
there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter
with a boy's curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room
one dayit was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate
it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort
'from india'
said he as he took it up 'pondicherry postmark
what can this be'
opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate
i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face
his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand 'k
k
k'
he shrieked and then 'my god my god my sins have overtaken me'
'what is it uncle'
i cried
'death' said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror
i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated
there was nothing else save the five dried pips
what could be the reason of his overpowering terror
i left the breakfasttable and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other
'they may do what they like but i'll checkmate them still' said he with an oath
'tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer'
i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room
the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it
as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope
'i wish you john' said my uncle 'to witness my will
i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you
if you can enjoy it in peace well and good
if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy
i am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but i can't say what turn things are going to take
kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you'
i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him
the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it
yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives
i could see a change in my uncle however
he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society
most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil
when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul
at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin
well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back
we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden
there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of 'suicide'
but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it
the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some  pounds which lay to his credit at the bank
one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened
let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide
the letter arrived on march  
his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd
thank you
pray proceed
when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up
we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed
on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and 'letters memoranda receipts and a register' written beneath
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw
for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncle's life in america
some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier
others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north
well it was the beginning of ' when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of '
on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable
there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one
he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself
'why what on earth does this mean john'
he stammered
my heart had turned to lead
'it is k k k' said i
he looked inside the envelope
'so it is' he cried
'here are the very letters
but what is this written above them'
'put the papers on the sundial' i read peeping over his shoulder
'what papers
what sundial'
he asked
'the sundial in the garden
there is no other' said i 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed'
'pooh'
said he gripping hard at his courage
'we are in a civilised land here and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
where does the thing come from'
'from dundee' i answered glancing at the postmark
'some preposterous practical joke' said he
'what have i to do with sundials and papers
i shall take no notice of such nonsense'
'i should certainly speak to the police' i said
'and be laughed at for my pains
nothing of the sort'
'then let me do so'
'no i forbid you
i won't have a fuss made about such nonsense'
it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man
i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings
on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill
i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home
in that however i was in error
upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once
my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull
i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness
he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes'
carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder
there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him
in this sinister way i came into my inheritance
you will ask me why i did not dispose of it
i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another
it was in january ' that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then
during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation
i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
this is the envelope he continued
the postmark is londoneastern division
within are the very words which were upon my father's last message 'k
k k' and then 'put the papers on the sundial'
what have you done
asked holmes
nothing
nothing
to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless
i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it
i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
tut
tut
cried sherlock holmes
you must act man or you are lost
nothing but energy can save you
this is no time for despair
i have seen the police
ah
but they listened to my story with a smile
i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
incredible imbecility
he cried
they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me
has he come with you tonight
no
his orders were to stay in the house
again holmes raved in the air
why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you not come at once
i did not know
it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
it is really two days since you had the letter
we should have acted before this
you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us
there is one thing said john openshaw
he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table
i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour
i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction
beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much
i think myself that it is a page from some private diary
the writing is undoubtedly my uncle's
holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book
it was headed march  and beneath were the following enigmatical notices  th
hudson came
same old platform
th
set the pips on mccauley paramore and       john swain of st augustine
th
mccauley cleared
th
john swain cleared
th
visited paramore
all well
thank you
said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor
and now you must on no account lose another instant
we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me
you must get home instantly and act
what shall i do
there is but one thing to do
it must be done at once
you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described
you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains
you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them
having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed
do you understand
entirely
do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present
i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven
the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you
the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat
you have given me fresh life and hope
i shall certainly do as you advise
do not lose an instant
and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
how do you go back
by train from waterloo
it is not yet nine
the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety
and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
i am armed
that is well
tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case
i shall see you at horsham then
no your secret lies in london
it is there that i shall seek it
then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers
i shall take your advice in every particular
he shook hands with us and took his leave
outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more
sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling
i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this
save perhaps the sign of four
well yes
save perhaps that
and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos
but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are
there can be no question as to their nature he answered
then what are they
who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family
sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together
the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it
as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after
we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to
problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment
it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do
if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion
yes i answered laughing
it was a singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember
botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco
those i think were the main points of my analysis
holmes grinned at the last item
well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it
now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources
kindly hand me down the letter k of the 'american encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you
thank you
now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it
in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america
men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town
his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america
as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors
did you remark the postmarks of those letters
the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
from east london
what do you deduce from that
they are all seaports
that the writer was on board of a ship
excellent
we have already a clue
there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship
and now let us consider another point
in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days
does that suggest anything
a greater distance to travel
but the letter had also a greater distance to come
then i do not see the point
there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship
it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission
you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee
if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed
i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
it is possible
more than that
it is probable
and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution
the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance
but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
good god
i cried
what can it mean this relentless persecution
the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship
i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury
there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination
their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society
but of what society
have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan
i never have
holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
here it is said he presently  'ku klux klan
a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle
this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida
its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views
its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others
on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country
if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south
eventually in the year  the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date'
you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers
it may well have been cause and effect
it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered
then the page we have seen  is such as we might expect
it ran if i remember right 'sent the pips to a b and c'that is sent the society's warning to them
then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him
there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellowmen
it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city
sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down
you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw's
what steps will you take
i asked
it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
i may have to go down to horsham after all
you will not go there first
no i shall commence with the city
just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it
it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart
holmes i cried you are too late
ah
said he laying down his cup i feared as much
how was it done
he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved
my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading 'tragedy near waterloo bridge'
here is the account  between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue
the alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered
it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham
it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats
the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages
we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him
that hurts my pride watson he said at last
it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride
it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang
that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death
he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last
how could they have decoyed him down there
the embankment is not on the direct line to the station
the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose
well watson we shall see who will win in the long run
i am going out now
to the police
no i shall be my own police
when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before
all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street
sherlock holmes had not come back yet
it was nearly ten o'clock before he entered looking pale and worn
he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water
you are hungry i remarked
starving
it had escaped my memory
i have had nothing since breakfast
nothing
not a bite
i had no time to think of it
and how have you succeeded
well
you have a clue
i have them in the hollow of my hand
young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged
why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them
it is well thought of
what do you mean
he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table
of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope
on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j
o
then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque 'lone star' savannah georgia
that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling
it may give him a sleepless night
he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him
and who is this captain calhoun
the leader of the gang
i shall have the others but he first
how did you trace it then
he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names
i have spent the whole day said he over lloyd's registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in '
there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months
of these one the 'lone star' instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union
texas i think
i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin
what then
i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque 'lone star' was there in january ' my suspicion became a certainty
i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
yes
the 'lone star' had arrived here last week
i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah
i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
what will you do then
oh i have my hand upon him
he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship
the others are finns and germans
i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night
i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo
by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track
very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year
we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us
we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star
adventure vi
the man with the twisted lip  isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st george's was much addicted to opium
the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quincey's description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects
he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives
i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man
one nightit was in june 'there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock
i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment
a patient
said she
you'll have to go out
i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day
we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum
our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room
you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wife's neck and sobbed upon her shoulder
oh i'm in such trouble
she cried i do so want a little help
why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney
how you startled me kate
i had not an idea who you were when you came in
i didn't know what to do so i came straight to you
that was always the way
folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse
it was very sweet of you to come
now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it
or should you rather that i sent james off to bed
oh no no
i want the doctor's advice and help too
it's about isa
he has not been home for two days
i am so frightened about him
it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion
we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find
did she know where her husband was
was it possible that we could bring him back to her
it seems that it was
she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city
hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening
but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects
there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane
but what was she to do
how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him
there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it
might i not escort her to this place
and then as a second thought why should she come at all
i was isa whitney's medical adviser and as such i had influence over him
i could manage it better if i were alone
i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me
and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be
but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure
upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge
between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search
ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer
out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire
as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth
thank you
i have not come to stay said i
there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him
there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me
my god
it's watson said he
he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter
i say watson what o'clock is it
nearly eleven
of what day
of friday june th
good heavens
i thought it was wednesday
it is wednesday
what d'you want to frighten a chap for
he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key
i tell you that it is friday man
your wife has been waiting this two days for you
you should be ashamed of yourself
so i am
but you've got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many
but i'll go home with you
i wouldn't frighten katepoor little kate
give me your hand
have you a cab
yes i have one waiting
then i shall go in it
but i must owe something
find what i owe watson
i am all off colour
i can do nothing for myself
i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager
as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me
the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
i glanced down
they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
i took two steps forward and looked back
it took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment
he had turned his back so that none could see him but i
his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes
he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility
holmes
i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den
as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears
if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you
i have a cab outside
then pray send him home in it
you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief
i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me
if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes
it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes' requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence
in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitney's bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness
in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes
for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter
i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views
i was certainly surprised to find you there
but not more so than i to find you
i came to find a friend
and i to find an enemy
an enemy
yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey
briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now
had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of paul's wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights
what
you do not mean bodies
ay bodies watson
we should be rich men if we had  pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den
it is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more
but our trap should be here
he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs
now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
you'll come with me won't you
if i can be of use
oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so
my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one
the cedars
yes that is mr st clair's house
i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry
where is it then
near lee in kent
we have a sevenmile drive before us
but i am all in the dark
of course you are
you'll know all about it presently
jump up here
all right john we shall not need you
here's half a crown
look out for me tomorrow about eleven
give her her head
so long then
he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers
a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds
holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts
we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best
you have a grand gift of silence watson said he
it makes you quite invaluable as a companion
'pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant
i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door
you forget that i know nothing about it
i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee
it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon
there's plenty of thread no doubt but i can't get the end of it into my hand
now i'll state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
proceed then
some years agoto be definite in may there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money
he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style
by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in  he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children
he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the  from cannon street every night
mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him
i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to  pounds s while he has  pounds standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank
there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind
last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks
now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company
now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight
mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the company's office got her packet and found herself at exactly  walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station
have you followed me so far
it is very clear
if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself
while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window
the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated
he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie
convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor
at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street
filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat
the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen
there was no sign of him there
in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there
both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon
so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it
out there fell a cascade of children's bricks
it was the toy which he had promised to bring home
this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious
the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime
the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves
between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water
the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below
on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom
thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat
his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there
there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair
out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter
the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clair's story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes
so much for the lascar manager
now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair
his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city
he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas
some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall
here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him
i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time
his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him
a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby
this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
but a cripple
said i
what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life
he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man
surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
pray continue your narrative
mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter
one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him
there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source
he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police
as to mrs st clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming
he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find
it was neville st clair's coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded
and what do you think they found in the pockets
i cannot imagine
no i don't think you would guess
every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies pennies and  halfpennies
it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide
but a human body is a different matter
there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room
would the body be dressed in a coat alone
no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough
suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed
what would he do then
it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments
he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink
he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street
there is not an instant to be lost
he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking
he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared
it certainly sounds feasible
well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better
boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him
he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one
there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever
i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us
just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows
we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion
we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent
see that light among the trees
that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horse's feet
but why are you not conducting the case from baker street
i asked
because there are many inquiries which must be made out here
mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague
i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband
here we are
whoa there whoa
we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds
a stableboy had run out to the horse's head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house
as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question
well
she cried well
and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders
no good news
none
no bad
no
thank god for that
but come in
you must be weary for you have had a long day
this is my friend dr watson
he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation
i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly
you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us
my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed
if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy
now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer
certainly madam
do not trouble about my feelings
i am not hysterical nor given to fainting
i simply wish to hear your real real opinion
upon what point
in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive
sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question
frankly now
she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair
frankly then madam i do not
you think that he is dead
i do
murdered
i don't say that
perhaps
and on what day did he meet his death
on monday
then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today
sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised
what
he roared
yes today
she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air
may i see it
certainly
he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently
i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder
the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight
coarse writing murmured holmes
surely this is not your husband's writing madam
no but the enclosure is
i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address
how can you tell that
the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself
the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used
if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade
this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it
it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles
let us now see the letter
ha
there has been an enclosure here
yes there was a ring
his signetring
and you are sure that this is your husband's hand
one of his hands
one
his hand when he wrote hurriedly
it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well
'dearest do not be frightened
all will come well
there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify
wait in patienceneville'
written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark
hum
posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb
ha
and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco
and you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand madam
none
neville wrote those words
and they were posted today at gravesend
well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over
but he must be alive mr
holmes
unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent
the ring after all proves nothing
it may have been taken from him
no no it is it is his very own writing
very well
it may however have been written on monday and only posted today
that is possible
if so much may have happened between
oh you must not discourage me mr holmes
i know that all is well with him
there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him
on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened
do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death
i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view
but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you
i cannot imagine
it is unthinkable
and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you
no
and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane
very much so
was the window open
yes
then he might have called to you
he might
he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry
yes
a call for help you thought
yes
he waved his hands
but it might have been a cry of surprise
astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands
it is possible
and you thought he was pulled back
he disappeared so suddenly
he might have leaped back
you did not see anyone else in the room
no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs
quite so
your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on
but without his collar or tie
i distinctly saw his bare throat
had he ever spoken of swandam lane
never
had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium
never
thank you mrs st clair
those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear
we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow
a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure
sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient
it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting
he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs
with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features
so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment
the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night
awake watson
he asked
yes
game for a morning drive
certainly
then dress
no one is stirring yet but i know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out
he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
as i dressed i glanced at my watch
it was no wonder that no one was stirring
it was twentyfive minutes past four
i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse
i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots
i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe
i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross
but i think i have the key of the affair now
and where is it
i asked smiling
in the bathroom he answered
oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity
i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag
come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock
we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine
in the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head
we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road
a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream
it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop
i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all
in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side
passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street
sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him
one of them held the horse's head while the other led us in
who is on duty
asked holmes
inspector bradstreet sir
ah bradstreet how are you
a tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket
i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet
certainly mr holmes
step into my room here
it was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall
the inspector sat down at his desk
what can i do for you mr
holmes
i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee
yes
he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
so i heard
you have him here
in the cells
is he quiet
oh he gives no trouble
but he is a dirty scoundrel
dirty
yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinker's
well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it
i should like to see him very much
would you
that is easily done
come this way
you can leave your bag
no i think that i'll take it
very good
come this way if you please
he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
the third on the right is his said the inspector
here it is
he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through
he is asleep said he
you can see him very well
we both put our eyes to the grating
the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily
he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness
a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
he's a beauty isn't he
said the inspector
he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes
i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge
he
he
you are a funny one chuckled the inspector
now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
well i don't know why not said the inspector
he doesn't look a credit to the bow street cells does he
he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell
the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber
holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face
let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent
never in my life have i seen such a sight
the man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree
gone was the coarse brown tint
gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face
a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow
great heavens
cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man
i know him from the photograph
the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny
be it so said he
and pray what am i charged with
with making away with mr neville st oh come you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin
well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake
if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained
no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes
you would have done better to have trusted your wife
it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner
god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father
my god
what an exposure
what can i do
sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder
if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity
on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers
inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities
the case would then never go into court at all
god bless you
cried the prisoner passionately
i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
you are the first who have ever heard my story
my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education
i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london
one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them
there was the point from which all my adventures started
it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles
when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill
i took advantage now of my attainments
i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster
then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar
for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than s
d
i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for  pounds
i was at my wit's end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me
i begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise
in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt
well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at  pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still
it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers
only one man knew my secret
he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town
this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession
well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money
i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn  pounds a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city
all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take  pounds
as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
my dear wife knew that i had business in the city
she little knew what
last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me
i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me
i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend
swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig
even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise
but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me
i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning
then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings
i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames
the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer
i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain
i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face
knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear
that note only reached her yesterday said holmes
good god
what a week she must have spent
the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved
probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days
that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it
but have you never been prosecuted for begging
many times but what was a fine to me
it must stop here however said bradstreet
if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone
i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken
but if you are found again then all must come out
i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up
i wish i knew how you reach your results
i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag
i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast
vii
the adventure of the blue carbuncle  i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season
he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand
beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places
a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you
not at all
i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results
the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction
i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals
i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
no no
no crime said sherlock holmes laughing
only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal
we have already had experience of such
so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime
precisely
you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
you know peterson the commissionaire
yes
it is to him that this trophy belongs
it is his hat
no no he found it
its owner is unknown
i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem
and first as to how it came here
it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of peterson's fire
the facts are these about four o'clock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road
in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder
as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs
one of the latter knocked off the man's hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him
peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road
the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose
which surely he restored to their owner
my dear fellow there lies the problem
it is true that 'for mrs henry baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg and it is also true that the initials 'h
b'
are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
what then did peterson do
he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me
the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner
did he not advertise
no
then what clue could you have as to his identity
only as much as we can deduce
from his hat
precisely
but you are joking
what can you gather from this old battered felt
here is my lens
you know my methods
what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article
i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully
it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear
the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured
there was no maker's name but as holmes had remarked the initials h
b
were scrawled upon one side
it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing
for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink
i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend
on the contrary watson you can see everything
you fail however to reason from what you see
you are too timid in drawing your inferences
then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat
he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him
it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability
that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days
he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him
this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him
my dear holmes
he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance
he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream
these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat
also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house
you are certainly joking holmes
not in the least
is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained
i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you
for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual
for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head
it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose
it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it
the decline of his fortunes then
this hat is three years old
these flat brims curled at the edge came in then
it is a hat of the very best quality
look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining
if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world
well that is clear enough certainly
but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression
sherlock holmes laughed
here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer
they are never sold upon hats
if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind
but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect
your reasoning is certainly plausible
the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining
the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber
they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream
this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training
but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him
this hat has not been brushed for weeks
when i see you my dear watson with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection
but he might be a bachelor
nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife
remember the card upon the bird's leg
you have an answer to everything
but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house
one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet
are you satisfied
well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment
the goose mr holmes
the goose sir
he gasped
eh
what of it then
has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window
holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face
see here sir
see what my wife found in its crop
he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle
by jove peterson
said he this is treasure trove indeed
i suppose you know what you have got
a diamond sir
a precious stone
it cuts into glass as though it were putty
it's more than a precious stone
it is the precious stone
not the countess of morcar's blue carbuncle
i ejaculated
precisely so
i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately
it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of  pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
a thousand pounds
great lord of mercy
the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us
that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked
precisely so on december nd just five days ago
john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewelcase
the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes
i have some account of the matter here i believe
he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph  hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery
john horner  plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle
james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose
he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away
on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable
ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms
catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness
inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms
evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes
horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court
hum
so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper
the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other
you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect
here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you
so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery
to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers
if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods
what will you say
give me a pencil and that slip of paper
now then 'found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat
mr henry baker can have the same by applying at  this evening at b baker street'
that is clear and concise
very
but will he see it
well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one
he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird
then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it
here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers
in which sir
oh in the globe star pall mall st james's evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you
very well sir
and this stone
ah yes i shall keep the stone
thank you
and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring
when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light
it's a bonny thing said he
just see how it glints and sparkles
of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime
every good stone is
they are the devil's pet baits
in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
this stone is not yet twenty years old
it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red
in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history
there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal
who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison
i'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it
do you think that this man horner is innocent
i cannot tell
well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter
it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold
that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
and you can do nothing until then
nothing
in that case i shall continue my professional round
but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
very glad to see you
i dine at seven
there is a woodcock i believe
by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop
i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when i found myself in baker street once more
as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight
just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes' room
mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume
pray take this chair by the fire mr baker
it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter
ah watson you have just come at the right time
is that your hat mr
baker
yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat
he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown
a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes' surmise as to his habits
his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune
we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address
i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise
our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird
i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them
very naturally
by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it
to eat it
our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so
but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well
oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief
of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish  the man burst into a hearty laugh
they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me
no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard
sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
there is your hat then and there your bird said he
by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from
i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose
certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm
there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand
this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas
my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you
i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity
with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way
so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him
it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter
are you hungry watson
not particularly
then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
by all means
it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats
outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots
our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street
in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn
holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord
your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he
my geese
the man seemed surprised
yes
i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club
ah
yes i see
but you see sir them's not our geese
indeed
whose then
well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden
indeed
i know some of them
which was it
breckinridge is his name
ah
i don't know him
well here's your good health landlord and prosperity to your house
goodnight
now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air
remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence
it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands
let us follow it out to the bitter end
faces to the south then and quick march
we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market
one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters
goodevening
it's a cold night said holmes
the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble
let you have five hundred tomorrow morning
that's no good
well there are some on the stall with the gasflare
ah but i was recommended to you
who by
the landlord of the alpha
oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen
fine birds they were too
now where did you get them from
to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at
let's have it straight now
it is straight enough
i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha
well then i shan't tell you
so now
oh it is a matter of no importance but i don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle
warm
you'd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am
when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but it's 'where are the geese'
and 'who did you sell the geese to'
and 'what will you take for the geese'
one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them
well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly
if you won't tell us the bet is off that is all
but i'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred
well then you've lost your fiver for it's town bred snapped the salesman
it's nothing of the kind
i say it is
i don't believe it
d'you think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper
i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred
you'll never persuade me to believe that
will you bet then
it's merely taking your money for i know that i am right
but i'll have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate
the salesman chuckled grimly
bring me the books bill said he
the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop
you see this little book
well
that's the list of the folk from whom i buy
d'you see
well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger
now then
you see this other page in red ink
well that is a list of my town suppliers
now look at that third name
just read it out to me
mrs oakshott  brixton road read holmes
quite so
now turn that up in the ledger
holmes turned to the page indicated
here you are 'mrs
oakshott  brixton road egg and poultry supplier'
now then what's the last entry
'december nd
twentyfour geese at s
d'
quite so
there you are
and underneath
'sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s'
what have you to say now
sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined
he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words
a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him
when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he
i daresay that if i had put  pounds down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager
well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow
it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should  his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left
turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
i've had enough of you and your geese he shouted
i wish you were all at the devil together
if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk i'll set the dog at you
you bring mrs oakshott here and i'll answer her but what have you to do with it
did i buy the geese off you
no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man
well then ask mrs oakshott for it
she told me to ask you
well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care
i've had enough of it
get out of this
he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
ha
this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes
come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow
striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder
he sprang round and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
who are you then
what do you want
he asked in a quavering voice
you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now
i think that i could be of assistance to you
you
who are you
how could you know anything of the matter
my name is sherlock holmes
it is my business to know what other people don't know
but you can know nothing of this
excuse me i know everything of it
you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member
oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers
i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter
sherlock holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing
in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he
but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting
the man hesitated for an instant
my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance
no no the real name said holmes sweetly
it is always awkward doing business with an alias
a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
well then said he my real name is james ryder
precisely so
head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan
pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe
then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street
nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him
here we are
said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room
the fire looks very seasonable in this weather
you look cold mr ryder
pray take the basketchair
i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours
now then
you want to know what became of those geese
yes sir
or rather i fancy of that goose
it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail
ryder quivered with emotion
oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to
it came here
here
yes and a most remarkable bird it proved
i don't wonder that you should take an interest in it
it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen
i have it here in my museum
our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand
holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance
ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it
the game's up ryder said holmes quietly
hold up man or you'll be into the fire
give him an arm back into his chair watson
he's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity
give him a dash of brandy
so
now he looks a little more human
what a shrimp it is to be sure
for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me
still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete
you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcar's
it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice
i seeher ladyship's waitingmaid
well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used
it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you
you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
what did you do then
you made some small job in my lady's roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for
then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested
you then  ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees
for god's sake have mercy
he shrieked
think of my father
of my mother
it would break their hearts
i never went wrong before
i never will again
i swear it
i'll swear it on a bible
oh don't bring it into court
for christ's sake don't
get back into your chair
said holmes sternly
it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing
i will fly mr holmes
i will leave the country sir
then the charge against him will break down
hum
we will talk about that
and now let us hear a true account of the next act
how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market
tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety
ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he
when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room
there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe
i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sister's house
she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market
all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road
my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel
then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do
i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville
one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole
i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence
he would show me how to turn the stone into money
but how to get to him in safety
i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel
i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket
i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived
my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word
i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn
there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail
i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach
the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop
but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter
as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others
'whatever were you doing with that bird jem'
says she
'well' said i 'you said you'd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest'
'oh' says she 'we've set yours aside for youjem's bird we call it
it's the big white one over yonder
there's twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market'
'thank you maggie' says i 'but if it is all the same to you i'd rather have that one i was handling just now'
'the other is a good three pound heavier' said she 'and we fattened it expressly for you'
'never mind
i'll have the other and i'll take it now' said i
'oh just as you like' said she a little huffed
'which is it you want then'
'that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock'
'oh very well
kill it and take it with you'
well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn
i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to
he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose
my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred
i left the bird rushed back to my sister's and hurried into the back yard
there was not a bird to be seen there
'where are they all maggie'
i cried
'gone to the dealer's jem'
'which dealer's'
'breckinridge of covent garden'
'but was there another with a barred tail'
i asked 'the same as the one i chose'
'yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and i could never tell them apart'
well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone
you heard him yourselves tonight
well he has always answered me like that
my sister thinks that i am going mad
sometimes i think that i am myself
and nowand now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character
god help me
god help me
he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands
there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes' fingertips upon the edge of the table
then my friend rose and threw open the door
get out
said he
what sir
oh heaven bless you
no more words
get out
and no more words were needed
there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies
if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse
i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul
this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened
send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life
besides it is the season of forgiveness
chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward
if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature
viii
the adventure of the speckled band  on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street
it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given
it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth
it was early in april in the year ' that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed
he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits
very sorry to knock you up watson said he but it's the common lot this morning
mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
what is it thena fire
no a client
it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me
she is waiting now in the sittingroom
now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate
should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset
i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him
i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom
a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered
goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily
my name is sherlock holmes
this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself
ha
i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire
pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested
what then
it is fear mr holmes
it is terror
she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal
her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard
sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances
you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm
we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt
you have come in by train this morning i see
you know me then
no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove
you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station
the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling
the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places
the marks are perfectly fresh
there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver
whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she
i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo
sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues
i have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid
i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need
it was from her that i had your address
oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me
at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted
farintosh said he
ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara
i think it was before your time watson
i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend
as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best
and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
alas
replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman
he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes
but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart
you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
i am all attention madam
my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
holmes nodded his head
the name is familiar to me said he
the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west
in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency
nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage
the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice
in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence
as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man
when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's remarriage
she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than  pounds a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage
shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe
dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran
the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path
violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfather's case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics
a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure
he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end
he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master
you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives
no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house
she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
your sister is dead then
she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you
you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position
we had however an aunt my mother's maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house
julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged
my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor
pray be precise as to details said he
it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory
the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited
the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings
of these bedrooms the first is dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own
there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor
do i make myself plain
perfectly so
the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke
she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding
at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back
'tell me helen' said she 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night'
'never' said i
'i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep'
'certainly not
but why'
'because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle
i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me
i cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn
i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it'
'no i have not
it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation'
'very likely
and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also'
'ah but i sleep more heavily than you'
'well it is of no great consequence at any rate'
she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
indeed said holmes
was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
always
and why
i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon
we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
quite so
pray proceed with your statement
i could not sleep that night
a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me
my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied
it was a wild night
the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman
i knew that it was my sister's voice
i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor
as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen
as i ran down the passage my sister's door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges
i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it
by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard
i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground
she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed
at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god
helen
it was the band
the speckled band'
there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words
i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown
when he reached my sister's side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness
such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
could you swear to it
that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry
it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
was your sister dressed
no she was in her nightdress
in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox
showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place
that is important
and what conclusions did the coroner come to
he investigated the case with great care for dr roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death
my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night
the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result
the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples
it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
how about poison
the doctors examined her for it but without success
what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
yes there are nearly always some there
ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band
sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative
two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever
a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage
his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading
my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring
two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept
imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death
i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room
i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
you have done wisely said my friend
but have you told me all
yes all
miss roylott you have not
you are screening your stepfather
why what do you mean
for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee
five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist
you have been cruelly used said holmes
the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist
he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire
this is a very deep business he said at last
there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action
yet we have not a moment to lose
if we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business
it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you
we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
excellent
you are not averse to this trip watson
by no means
then we shall both come
what are you going to do yourself
i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town
but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train so as to be there in time for your coming
and you may expect us early in the afternoon
i have myself some small business matters to attend to
will you not wait and breakfast
no i must go
my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you
i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
and what do you think of it all watson
asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair
it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
dark enough and sinister enough
yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
i cannot think
when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
but what then did the gipsies do
i cannot imagine
i see many objections to any such theory
and so do i
it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day
i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away
but what in the name of the devil
the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand
so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
which of you is holmes
asked this apparition
my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly
i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran
indeed doctor said holmes blandly
pray take a seat
i will do nothing of the kind
my stepdaughter has been here
i have traced her
what has she been saying to you
it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes
what has she been saying to you
screamed the old man furiously
but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably
ha
you put me off do you
said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop
i know you you scoundrel
i have heard of you before
you are holmes the meddler
my friend smiled
holmes the busybody
his smile broadened
holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice
holmes chuckled heartily
your conversation is most entertaining said he
when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
i will go when i have said my say
don't you dare to meddle with my affairs
i know that miss stoner has been here
i traced her
i am a dangerous man to fall foul of
see here
he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room
he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing
i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own
as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again
fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force
this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her
and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors' commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
it was nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion
he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures
i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he
to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned
the total income which at the time of the wife's death was little short of  pounds is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than  pounds
each daughter can claim an income of  pounds in case of marriage
it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
my morning's work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort
and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo
i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket
an eley's no
 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots
that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need
at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes
it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged
my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought
suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows
look there
said he
a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point
from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion
stoke moran
said he
yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver
there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going
there's the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house you'll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields
there it is where the lady is walking
and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes
yes i think we had better do as you suggest
we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead
i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business
it may stop his gossip
goodafternoon miss stoner
you see that we have been as good as our word
our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy
i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly
all has turned out splendidly
dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
we have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred
miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened
good heavens
she cried he has followed me then
so it appears
he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him
what will he say when he returns
he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track
you must lock yourself up from him tonight
if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow
now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side
in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin
the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit
holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sister's and the one next to the main building to dr roylott's chamber
exactly so
but i am now sleeping in the middle one
pending the alterations as i understand
by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
there were none
i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
ah
that is suggestive
now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open
there are windows in it of course
yes but very small ones
too narrow for anyone to pass through
as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side
now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters
miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success
there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar
then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry
hum
said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties
no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted
well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened
holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate
it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses
a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window
these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre
the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house
holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment
where does that bell communicate with
he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
it goes to the housekeeper's room
it looks newer than the other things
yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
your sister asked for it i suppose
no i never heard of her using it
we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards
then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled
finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall
finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug
why it's a dummy said he
won't it ring
no it is not even attached to a wire
this is very interesting
you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
how very absurd
i never noticed that before
very strange
muttered holmes pulling at the rope
there are one or two very singular points about this room
for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
that is also quite modern said the lady
done about the same time as the bellrope
remarked holmes
yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate
with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
dr grimesby roylott's chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished
a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye
holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest
what's in here
he asked tapping the safe
my stepfather's business papers
oh
you have seen inside then
only once some years ago
i remember that it was full of papers
there isn't a cat in it for example
no
what a strange idea
well look at this
he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
no we don't keep a cat
but there is a cheetah and a baboon
ah yes of course
well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay
there is one point which i should wish to determine
he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
thank you
that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket
hullo
here is something interesting
the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord
what do you make of that watson
it's a common enough lash
but i don't know why it should be tied
that is not quite so common is it
ah me
it's a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all
i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation
we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie
it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
i shall most certainly do so
the matter is too serious for any hesitation
your life may depend upon your compliance
i assure you that i am in your hands
in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment
yes it must be so
let me explain
i believe that that is the village inn over there
yes that is the crown
very good
your windows would be visible from there
certainly
you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back
then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy
i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
oh yes easily
the rest you will leave in our hands
but what will you do
we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
perhaps i have
then for pity's sake tell me what was the cause of my sister's death
i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
no i do not think so
i think that there was probably some more tangible cause
and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn
they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house
at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him
the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him
the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms
do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight
there is a distinct element of danger
can i be of assistance
your presence might be invaluable
then i shall certainly come
it is very kind of you
you speak of danger
you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more
i imagine that you saw all that i did
i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
you saw the ventilator too
yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms
it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
my dear holmes
oh yes i did
you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylott's cigar
now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms
it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
i deduced a ventilator
but what harm can there be in that
well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies
does not that strike you
i cannot as yet see any connection
did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed
no
it was clamped to the floor
did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
i cannot say that i have
the lady could not move her bed
it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull
holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
subtle enough and horrible enough
when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals
he has nerve and he has knowledge
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession
this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still
but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house
two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us
that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window
as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there
a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand
there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
my god
i whispered did you see it
holmes was for the moment as startled as i
his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
it is a nice household he murmured
that is the baboon
i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected
there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes' example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom
my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room
all was as we had seen it in the daytime
then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words  the least sound would be fatal to our plans
i nodded to show that i had heard
we must sit without light
he would see it through the ventilator
i nodded again
do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it
have your pistol ready in case we should need it
i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him
by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness
how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil
i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself
the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness
from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty
far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour
how long they seemed those quarters
twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall
suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal
someone in the next room had lit a darklantern
i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger
for half an hour i sat with straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull
you see it watson
he yelled
you see it
but i saw nothing
at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely
i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing
he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened
it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose
what can it mean
i gasped
it means that it is all over holmes answered
and perhaps after all it is for the best
take your pistol and we will enter dr roylott's room
with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor
twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand
it was a singular sight which met our eyes
on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day
his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head
as we entered he made neither sound nor motion
the band
the speckled band
whispered holmes
i took a step forward
in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
it is a swamp adder
cried holmes the deadliest snake in india
he has died within ten seconds of being bitten
violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another
let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead man's lap and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arm's length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it
such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran
it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day
i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data
the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word 'band' which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door
my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed
the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed
the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track
the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training
the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage
it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work
then i thought of the whistle
of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim
he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed
it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim
i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room
an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator
the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained
the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof
i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
with the result of driving it through the ventilator
and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side
some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw
in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylott's death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
ix
the adventure of the engineer's thumb  of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherley's thumb and that of colonel warburton's madness
of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results
the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth
at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
it was in the summer of ' not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise
i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us
my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials
one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence
one morning at a little before seven o'clock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom
i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs
as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him
i've got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder he's all right
what is it then
i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room
it's a new patient he whispered
i thought i'd bring him round myself then he couldn't slip away
there he is all safe and sound
i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you
and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him
i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table
he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books
round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains
he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control
i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night
i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable
i took it up and glanced at it
mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer a victoria street rd floor
that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor
i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair
you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation
oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed
he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides
all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh
stop it
i cried pull yourself together
and i poured out some water from a caraffe
it was useless however
he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone
presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking
i have been making a fool of myself he gasped
not at all
drink this
i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
that's better
said he
and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be
he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand
it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it
there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been
it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
good heavens
i cried this is a terrible injury
it must have bled considerably
yes it did
i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time
when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
excellent
you should have been a surgeon
it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province
this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument
a thing like a cleaver said he
an accident i presume
by no means
what
a murderous attack
very murderous indeed
you horrify me
i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages
he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time
how is that
i asked when i had finished
capital
between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man
i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through
perhaps you had better not speak of the matter
it is evidently trying to your nerves
oh no not now
i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done
ha
cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police
oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well
would you give me an introduction to him
i'll do better
i'll take you round to him myself
i should be immensely obliged to you
we'll call a cab and go together
we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him
do you feel equal to it
yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story
then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant
i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street
sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece
he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal
when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he
pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home
tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure
i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us
you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london
by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner  matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich
two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street
i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
to me it has been exceptionally so
during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me
my gross takings amount to  pounds s
every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all
yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business
he brought up a card too with the name of 'colonel lysander stark' engraved upon it
close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness
i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man
his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured
he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty
'mr
hatherley'
said he with something of a german accent
'you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret'
i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address
'may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character'
'well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment
i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london'
'that is quite correct' i answered 'but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications
i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me'
'undoubtedly so
but you will find that all i say is really to the point
i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family'
'if i promise to keep a secret' said i 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so'
he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye
'do you promise then'
said he at last
'yes i promise'
'absolute and complete silence before during and after
no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing'
'i have already given you my word'
'very good'
he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door
the passage outside was empty
'that's all right' said he coming back
'i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs
now we can talk in safety'
he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience
'i beg that you will state your business sir' said i 'my time is of value'
heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips
'how would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you'
he asked
'most admirably'
'i say a night's work but an hour's would be nearer the mark
i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear
if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves
what do you think of such a commission as that'
'the work appears to be light and the pay munificent'
'precisely so
we shall want you to come tonight by the last train'
'where to'
'to eyford in berkshire
it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading
there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about '
'very good'
'i shall come down in a carriage to meet you'
'there is a drive then'
'yes our little place is quite out in the country
it is a good seven miles from eyford station'
'then we can hardly get there before midnight
i suppose there would be no chance of a train back
i should be compelled to stop the night'
'yes we could easily give you a shakedown'
'that is very awkward
could i not come at some more convenient hour'
'we have judged it best that you should come late
it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession
still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so'
i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me
'not at all' said i 'i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes
i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do'
'quite so
it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity
i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you
i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers'
'entirely'
'then the matter stands thus
you are probably aware that fuller'searth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england'
'i have heard so'
'some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading
i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller'searth in one of my fields
on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours
these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine
naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this
i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields
this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press
this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject
we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans
that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight
i hope that i make it all plain'
'i quite follow you' said i
'the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller'searth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit'
'ah'
said he carelessly 'we have our own process
we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are
but that is a mere detail
i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you'
he rose as he spoke
'i shall expect you then at eyford at '
'i shall certainly be there'
'and not a word to a soul'
he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room
well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me
on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones
on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller'searth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand
however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue
at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station
however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven o'clock
i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open
he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go
one horse
interjected holmes
yes only one
did you observe the colour
yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage
it was a chestnut
tiredlooking or fresh
oh fresh and glossy
thank you
i am sorry to have interrupted you
pray continue your most interesting statement
away we went then and we drove for at least an hour
colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve
he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity
the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly
i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged
at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand
colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us
we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away
it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath
suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction
it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us
i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material
she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand
colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
'perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes' said he throwing open another door
it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered
colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door
'i shall not keep you waiting an instant' said he and vanished into the darkness
i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry
then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it
it was a wonderfully silent house
there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still
a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me
who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place
and where was the place
i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea
for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all
yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country
i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee
suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open
the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face
i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart
she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her
'i would go' said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly 'i would go
i should not stay here
there is no good for you to do'
'but madam' said i 'i have not yet done what i came for
i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine'
'it is not worth your while to wait' she went on
'you can pass through the door no one hinders'
and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together
'for the love of heaven'
she whispered 'get away from here before it is too late'
but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way
i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me
was it all to go for nothing
why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due
this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac
with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was
she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come
the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson
'this is my secretary and manager' said the colonel
'by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now
i fear that you have felt the draught'
'on the contrary' said i 'i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close'
he shot one of his suspicious looks at me
'perhaps we had better proceed to business then' said he
'mr
ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine'
'i had better put my hat on i suppose'
'oh no it is in the house'
'what you dig fuller'searth in the house'
'no no
this is only where we compress it
but never mind that
all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it'
we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him
it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them
there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches
i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions
ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman
colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked
within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time
ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in
'we are now' said he 'actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on
the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you
the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force
perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right'
i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly
it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure
when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders
an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked
this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right
when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity
it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller'searth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
'what are you doing there'
he asked
i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me
'i was admiring your fuller'searth' said i 'i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used'
the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech
his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
'very well' said he 'you shall know all about the machine'
he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock
i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves
'hullo'
i yelled
'hullo
colonel
let me out'
and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth
it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder
he had set the engine at work
the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough
by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock
i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries
the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface
then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it
if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap
easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me
already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart
i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood
as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward
for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death
the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side
the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape
i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right
it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected
'come
come'
she cried breathlessly
'they will be here in a moment
they will see that you are not there
oh do not waste the soprecious time but come'
this time at least i did not scorn her advice
i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair
the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath
my guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit's end
then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly
'it is your only chance' said she
'it is high but it may be that you can jump it'
as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other
i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out
how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down
i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me
if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance
the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back
'fritz
fritz'
she cried in english 'remember your promise after the last time
you said it should not be again
he will be silent
oh he will be silent'
'you are mad elise'
he shouted struggling to break away from her
'you will be the ruin of us
he has seen too much
let me pass i say'
he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon
i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell
i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below
i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet
suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me
i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound
i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes
how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell
it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself
my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers
but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen
i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night
were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train
there would be one to reading in less than an hour
the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived
i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark
the name was strange to him
had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me
no he had not
was there a policestation anywhere near
there was one about three miles off
it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was
i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police
it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here
i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise
we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative
then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings
here is an advertisement which will interest you said he
it appeared in all the papers about a year ago
listen to this 'lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer
left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night and has not been heard of since
was dressed in' etc etc
ha
that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy
good heavens
cried my patient
then that explains what the girl said
undoubtedly
it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship
well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford
some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village
there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself
bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre
there you are said he
that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
the place we want must be somewhere near that line
you said ten miles i think sir
it was an hour's good drive
and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious
they must have done so
i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden
perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties
i hardly think that likely
i never saw a more inexorable face in my life
oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet
well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found
i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly
really now
cried the inspector you have formed your opinion
come now we shall see who agrees with you
i say it is south for the country is more deserted there
and i say east said my patient
i am for west remarked the plainclothes man
there are several quiet little villages up there
and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any
come cried the inspector laughing it's a very pretty diversity of opinion
we have boxed the compass among us
who do you give your casting vote to
you are all wrong
but we can't all be
oh yes you can
this is my point
he placed his finger in the centre of the circle
this is where we shall find them
but the twelvemile drive
gasped hatherley
six out and six back
nothing simpler
you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in
how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully
of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang
none at all said holmes
they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver
we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector
they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand
we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands
but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough
but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice
as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
a house on fire
asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way
yes sir
said the stationmaster
when did it break out
i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
whose house is it
dr
becher's
tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose
the stationmaster laughed heartily
no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isn't a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat
but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm
the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
that's it
cried hatherley in intense excitement
there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay
that second window is the one that i jumped from
well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them
there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time
now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now
and holmes' fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman
early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor
about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly
large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to
how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale
he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones
on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me
i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained
experience said holmes laughing
indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
x
the adventure of the noble bachelor  the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves
fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama
as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him
i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be
here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered
your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter
yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting
this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie
he broke the seal and glanced over the contents
oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all
not social then
no distinctly professional
and from a noble client
one of the highest in england
my dear fellow i congratulate you
i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case
it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation
you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not
it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner
i have had nothing else to do
it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up
i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column
the latter is always instructive
but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding
oh yes with the deepest interest
that is well
the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon
i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter
this is what he says  'my dear mr sherlock holmeslord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion
i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding
mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance
i will call at four o'clock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance
yours faithfully st
simon'
it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle
he says four o'clock
it is three now
he will be here in an hour
then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject
turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is
he picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece
here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee
'lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral'
hum
'arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable
born in '
he's fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage
was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration
the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs
they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side
ha
well there is nothing very instructive in all this
i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid
i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable
i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van
that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first
pray give me the results of your newspaper selections
here is the first notice which i can find
it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back 'a marriage has been arranged' it says 'and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran
esq of san francisco cal usa' that is all
terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire
there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week
ah here it is 'there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product
one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic
an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders
lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire
miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future
as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress'
anything else
asked holmes yawning
oh yes plenty
then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st george's hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran
two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwater's place near petersfield
those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride
before the what
asked holmes with a start
the vanishing of the lady
when did she vanish then
at the wedding breakfast
indeed
this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact
yes it struck me as being a little out of the common
they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this
pray let me have the details
i warn you that they are very incomplete
perhaps we may make them less so
such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you
it is headed 'singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding'  'the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding
the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about
in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation
'the ceremony which was performed at st george's hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington
the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared
it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon
it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman
the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room
her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage
one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company
on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady
there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride'
and is that all
only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one
and it is  that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested
it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years
there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press
and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be
i would not have missed it for worlds
but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client
do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory
lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door
a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed
his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked
his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top
as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters
he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses
goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing
pray take the basketchair
this is my friend and colleague dr watson
draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over
a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes
i have been cut to the quick
i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society
no i am descending
i beg pardon
my last client of the sort was a king
oh really
i had no idea
and which king
the king of scandinavia
what
had he lost his wife
you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours
of course
very right
very right
i'm sure i beg pardon
as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion
thank you
i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more
i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride
lord st simon glanced over it
yes it is correct as far as it goes
but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion
i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
pray do so
when did you first meet miss hatty doran
in san francisco a year ago
you were travelling in the states
yes
did you become engaged then
no
but you were on a friendly footing
i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused
her father is very rich
he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope
and how did he make his money
in mining
he had nothing a few years ago
then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds
now what is your own impression as to the young lady'syour wife's character
the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire
you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man
during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster
she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions
she is impetuousvolcanic i was about to say
she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions
on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad not i thought her to be at bottom a noble woman
i believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
have you her photograph
i brought this with me
he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth
holmes gazed long and earnestly at it
then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon
the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance
yes her father brought her over for this last london season
i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her
she brought i understand a considerable dowry
a fair dowry
not more than is usual in my family
and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli
i really have made no inquiries on the subject
very naturally not
did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding
yes
was she in good spirits
never better
she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives
indeed
that is very interesting
and on the morning of the wedding
she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony
and did you observe any change in her then
well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp
the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
pray let us have it for all that
oh it is childish
she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry
she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew
there was a moment's delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
indeed
you say that there was a gentleman in the pew
some of the general public were present then
oh yes
it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open
this gentleman was not one of your wife's friends
no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person
i hardly noticed his appearance
but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point
lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it
what did she do on reentering her father's house
i saw her in conversation with her maid
and who is her maid
alice is her name
she is an american and came from california with her
a confidential servant
a little too much so
it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties
still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way
how long did she speak to this alice
oh a few minutes
i had something else to think of
you did not overhear what they said
lady st simon said something about 'jumping a claim'
she was accustomed to use slang of the kind
i have no idea what she meant
american slang is very expressive sometimes
and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid
she walked into the breakfastroom
on your arm
no alone
she was very independent in little matters like that
then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room
she never came back
but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her bride's dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
quite so
and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr doran's house that morning
ah yes
i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her
lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows
we have been on a friendly footing for some yearsi may say on a very friendly footing
she used to be at the allegro
i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes
flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me
she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church
she came to mr doran's door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again
she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row
did your wife hear all this
no thank goodness she did not
and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
yes
that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious
it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
well it is a possible supposition
you think so too
i did not say a probable one
but you do not yourself look upon this as likely
i do not think flora would hurt a fly
still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters
pray what is your own theory as to what took place
well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one
i have given you all the facts
since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
in short that she had become suddenly deranged
well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion
well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling
and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data
may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window
we could see the other side of the road and the park
quite so
then i do not think that i need to detain you longer
i shall communicate with you
should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising
i have solved it
eh
what was that
i say that i have solved it
where then is my wife
that is a detail which i shall speedily supply
lord st simon shook his head
i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed
it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing
i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning
i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room
my dear holmes
i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt
my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty
circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreau's example
but i have heard all that you have heard
without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well
there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war
it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade
goodafternoon lestrade
you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box
the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him
what's up then
asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye
you look dissatisfied
and i feel dissatisfied
it is this infernal st simon marriage case
i can make neither head nor tail of the business
really
you surprise me
who ever heard of such a mixed affair
every clue seems to slip through my fingers
i have been at work upon it all day
and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket
yes i have been dragging the serpentine
in heaven's name what for
in search of the body of lady st
simon
sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily
have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain
he asked
why
what do you mean
because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion
i suppose you know all about it he snarled
well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up
oh indeed
then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter
i think it very unlikely
then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it
he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water
there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile
there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes
oh indeed
said my friend blowing blue rings into the air
you dragged them from the serpentine
no
they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper
they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
by the same brilliant reasoning every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe
and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this
at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance
i am afraid that you will find it difficult
are you indeed now
cried lestrade with some bitterness
i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences
you have made two blunders in as many minutes
this dress does implicate miss flora millar
and how
in the dress is a pocket
in the pocket is a cardcase
in the cardcase is a note
and here is the very note
he slapped it down upon the table in front of him
listen to this 'you will see me when all is ready
come at once
fhm'
now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance
here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach
very good lestrade said holmes laughing
you really are very fine indeed
let me see it
he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction
this is indeed important said he
ha
you find it so
extremely so
i congratulate you warmly
lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look
why he shrieked you're looking at the wrong side
on the contrary this is the right side
the right side
you're mad
here is the note written in pencil over here
and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply
there's nothing in it
i looked at it before said lestrade
'oct
th rooms s breakfast s
d cocktail s lunch s
d glass sherry d'
i see nothing in that
very likely not
it is most important all the same
as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again
i've wasted time enough said lestrade rising
i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first
he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door
just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter
lady st simon is a myth
there is not and there never has been any such person
lestrade looked sadly at my companion
then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away
he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat
there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little
it was after five o'clock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box
this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany
there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pt de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles
having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address
just before nine o'clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room
his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands
you seem to expect company
they have laid for five
yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he
i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived
ha
i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs
it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
my messenger reached you then
asked holmes
yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure
have you good authority for what you say
the best possible
lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead
what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
it is the purest accident
i cannot allow that there is any humiliation
ah you look on these things from another standpoint
i fail to see that anyone is to blame
i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted
having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis
it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table
you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position
i will make no allowance
i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used
i think that i heard a ring said holmes
yes there are steps on the landing
if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful
he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman
lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton
the lady i think you have already met
at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity
the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes
it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist
you're angry robert said she
well i guess you have every cause to be
pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly
oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn't know what i was doing or saying
i only wonder i didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar
perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter
if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already
for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it
he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner
then i'll tell our story right away said the lady
frank here and i met in ' in mcquire's camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim
we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing
the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to 'frisco
frank wouldn't throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it
it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves
frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa
so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived
'why shouldn't we be married right away then' said he 'and then i will feel sure of you and i won't claim to be your husband until i come back'
well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa  the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico
after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my frank's name among the killed
i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after
pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'frisco
not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead
then lord st simon came to 'frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank
still if i had married lord st simon of course i'd have done my duty by him
we can't command our love but we can our actions
i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be
but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew
i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him
i wonder i didn't drop
i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear
i didn't know what to do
should i stop the service and make a scene in the church
i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still
then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note
as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers
it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so
of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct
when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend
i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready
i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people
i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards
i hadn't been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road
he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park
i slipped out put on my things and followed him
some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank
we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to 'frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
i saw it in a paper explained the american
it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived
then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive
it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back
so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them
it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret
then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once
now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me
lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
then you won't forgive me
you won't shake hands before i go
oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure
he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him
i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper
i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship
i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them
i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight
he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room
then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes
it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes
the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable
nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard
you were not yourself at fault at all then
from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home
obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind
what could that something be
she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
had she seen someone then
if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely
you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american
then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her
it might be a lover it might be a husband
her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions
so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simon's narrative
when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the bride's manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear
she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter
and how in the world did you find them
it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know
the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels
how did you deduce the select
by the select prices
eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels
there are not many in london which charge at that rate
in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill
his letters were to be forwarded to  gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular
i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment
but with no very good result i remarked
his conduct was certainly not very gracious
ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune
i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position
draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings
xi
the adventure of the beryl coronet  holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along
it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone
my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder
it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun
down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell
the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual
indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure
he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers
yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs
as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
what on earth can be the matter with him
i asked
he is looking up at the numbers of the houses
i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands
here
yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally
i think that i recognise the symptoms
ha
did i not tell you
as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity
for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason
then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ
you have come to me to tell your story have you not
said he
you are fatigued with your haste
pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me
the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion
then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us
no doubt you think me mad
said he
i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes
god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it
public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain
private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul
besides it is not i alone
the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair
pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you
my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears
i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder  stevenson of threadneedle street
the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london
what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass
we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story
i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your cooperation
i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow
that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise
i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can
it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors
one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable
we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate
yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in england
i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
'mr
holder' said he 'i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money'
'the firm does so when the security is good'
i answered
'it is absolutely essential to me' said he 'that i should have  pounds at once
i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself
in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations'
'for how long may i ask do you want this sum'
i asked
'next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge
but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once'
'i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse' said i 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear
if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken'
'i should much prefer to have it so' said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair
'you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet'
'one of the most precious public possessions of the empire' said i
'precisely'
he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named
'there are thirtynine enormous beryls' said he 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable
the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked
i am prepared to leave it with you as my security'
i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
'you doubt its value'
he asked
'not at all
i only doubt'  'the propriety of my leaving it
you may set your mind at rest about that
i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it
it is a pure matter of form
is the security sufficient'
'ample'
'you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you
i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it
any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them
i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning'
seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty  pound notes
when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me
there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it
i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it
however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work
when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me
bankers' safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be
if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself
i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach
with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me
i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom
and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation
my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether
i have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months
she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction
she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place
that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
so much for the servants
my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it
i am a widower and have an only son arthur
he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous disappointment
i have no doubt that i am myself to blame
people tell me that i have spoiled him
very likely i have
when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love
i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
i have never denied him a wish
perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best
it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn
he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour
he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again
and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty
yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted
so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a woman's quick insight into character
and now there is only she to be described
she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter
she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be
she is my right hand
i do not know what i could do without her
in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes
twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him
i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas
it is too lateforever too late
now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story
when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client
lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed
mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it
'where have you put it'
asked arthur
'in my own bureau'
'well i hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night'
said he
'it is locked up' i answered
'oh any old key will fit that bureau
when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard'
he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said
he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face
'look here dad' said he with his eyes cast down 'can you let me have  pounds'
'no i cannot'
i answered sharply
'i have been far too generous with you in money matters'
'you have been very kind' said he 'but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again'
'and a very good thing too'
i cried
'yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man' said he
'i could not bear the disgrace
i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means'
i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month
'you shall not have a farthing from me' i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word
when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again
then i started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night
as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached
'tell me dad' said she looking i thought a little disturbed 'did you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight'
'certainly not'
'she came in just now by the back door
i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped'
'you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it
are you sure that everything is fastened'
'quite sure dad'
'then goodnight'
i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep
i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear
on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid
i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so
i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual
about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house
it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere
i lay listening with all my ears
suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room
i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door
'arthur'
i screamed 'you villain
you thief
how dare you touch that coronet'
the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands
he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength
at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death
i snatched it up and examined it
one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing
'you blackguard'
i shouted beside myself with rage
'you have destroyed it
you have dishonoured me forever
where are the jewels which you have stolen'
'stolen'
he cried
'yes thief'
i roared shaking him by the shoulder
'there are none missing
there cannot be any missing' said he
'there are three missing
and you know where they are
must i call you a liar as well as a thief
did i not see you trying to tear off another piece'
'you have called me names enough' said he 'i will not stand it any longer
i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me
i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world'
'you shall leave it in the hands of the police'
i cried halfmad with grief and rage
'i shall have this matter probed to the bottom'
'you shall learn nothing from me' said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature
'if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can'
by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger
mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthur's face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground
i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once
when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft
i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property
i was determined that the law should have its way in everything
'at least' said he 'you will not have me arrested at once
it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes'
'that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen' said i
and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation
he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones
'you may as well face the matter' said i 'you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous
if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten'
'keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it' he answered turning away from me with a sneer
i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him
there was but one way for it
i called in the inspector and gave him into custody
a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats
this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter
the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it
you may go to any expense which you think necessary
i have already offered a reward of  pounds
my god what shall i do
i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night
oh what shall i do
he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words
sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire
do you receive much company
he asked
none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthur's
sir george burnwell has been several times lately
no one else i think
do you go out much in society
arthur does
mary and i stay at home
we neither of us care for it
that is unusual in a young girl
she is of a quiet nature
besides she is not so very young
she is fourandtwenty
this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also
terrible
she is even more affected than i
you have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt
how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
i hardly consider that a conclusive proof
was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
yes it was twisted
do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it
god bless you
you are doing what you can for him and for me
but it is too heavy a task
what was he doing there at all
if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so
precisely
and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie
his silence appears to me to cut both ways
there are several singular points about the case
what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep
they considered that it might be caused by arthur's closing his bedroom door
a likely story
as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household
what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems
they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them
have they thought of looking outside the house
yes they have shown extraordinary energy
the whole garden has already been minutely examined
now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think
it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex
consider what is involved by your theory
you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered
i ask you now is such a theory tenable
but what other is there
cried the banker with a gesture of despair
if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them
it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened
i confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes' judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation
he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought
our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs
a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier
fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road
a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance
on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmen's entrance
on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare
holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmen's path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane
so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return
we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in
she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin
i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face
her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying
as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint
disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad
she asked
no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom
but i am so sure that he is innocent
you know what woman's instincts are
i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly
why is he silent then if he is innocent
who knows
perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him
how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
oh but he had only picked it up to look at it
oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent
let the matter drop and say no more
it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison
i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary
your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me
far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it
this gentleman
she asked facing round to me
no his friend
he wished us to leave him alone
he is round in the stable lane now
the stable lane
she raised her dark eyebrows
what can he hope to find there
ah
this i suppose is he
i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime
i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes
i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder
might i ask you a question or two
pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up
you heard nothing yourself last night
nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly
i heard that and i came down
you shut up the windows and doors the night before
did you fasten all the windows
yes
were they all fastened this morning
yes
you have a maid who has a sweetheart
i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him
yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet
i see
you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery
but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands
wait a little mr holder
we must come back to that
about this girl miss holder
you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume
yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in
i saw the man too in the gloom
do you know him
oh yes
he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round
his name is francis prosper
he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door
yes he did
and he is a man with a wooden leg
something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes
why you are like a magician said she
how do you know that
she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes' thin eager face
i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he
i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again
perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up
he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane
this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens
now we shall go upstairs said he at last
the banker's dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror
holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock
which key was used to open it
he asked
that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom
have you it here
that is it on the dressingtable
sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau
it is a noiseless lock said he
it is no wonder that it did not wake you
this case i presume contains the coronet
we must have a look at it
he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table
it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that i have ever seen
at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away
now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost
might i beg that you will break it off
the banker recoiled in horror
i should not dream of trying said he
then i will
holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result
i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it
an ordinary man could not do it
now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder
there would be a noise like a pistol shot
do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it
i do not know what to think
it is all dark to me
but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go
what do you think miss holder
i confess that i still share my uncle's perplexity
your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him
he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
thank you
we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up
with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever
i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms
but the gems mr holmes
where are they
i cannot tell
the banker wrung his hands
i shall never see them again
he cried
and my son
you give me hopes
my opinion is in no way altered
then for god's sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night
if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer
i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw
i would give my fortune to have them back
very good
i shall look into the matter between this and then
goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening
it was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine
several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair
it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more
he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class
i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace
i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it won't do
i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a willo'thewisp but i shall soon know which it is
i hope that i may be back in a few hours
he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition
i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand
he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea
i only looked in as i passed said he
i am going right on
where to
oh to the other side of the west end
it may be some time before i get back
don't wait up for me in case i should be late
how are you getting on
oh so so
nothing to complain of
i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house
it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal
however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self
i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply
his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks
he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt
i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room
it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise
i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible
you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning
why it is after nine now i answered
i should not be surprised if that were he
i thought i heard a ring
it was indeed our friend the financier
i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter
he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him
i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he
only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world
now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age
one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another
my niece mary has deserted me
deserted you
yes
her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table
i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him
perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so
it is to that remark that she refers in this note  'my dearest unclei feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred
i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever
do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an illservice to me
in life or in death i am ever your lovingmary'
what could she mean by that note mr holmes
do you think it points to suicide
no no nothing of the kind
it is perhaps the best possible solution
i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles
ha
you say so
you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something
where are the gems
you would not think  pounds apiece an excessive sum for them
i would pay ten
that would be unnecessary
three thousand will cover the matter
and there is a little reward i fancy
have you your checkbook
here is a pen
better make it out for  pounds
with a dazed face the banker made out the required check
holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table
with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
you have it
he gasped
i am saved
i am saved
the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly
owe
he caught up a pen
name the sum and i will pay it
no the debt is not to me
you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one
then it was not arthur who took them
i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not
you are sure of it
then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
he knows it already
when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me
your news of this morning however may open his lips
for heaven's sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery
i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it
and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary
they have now fled together
my mary
impossible
it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain
neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle
he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience
your niece knew nothing of such men
when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart
the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening
i cannot and i will not believe it
cried the banker with an ashen face
i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night
your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane
his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there
she told him of the coronet
his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will
i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one
she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true
your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom
petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair
presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands
she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath
he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain
as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved
but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right
he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight
sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other
in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye
then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene
is it possible
gasped the banker
you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks
he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands
he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret
and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder
oh my god
what a blind fool i have been
and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes
the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle
how cruelly i have misjudged him
when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me
i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions
i passed along the tradesmen's path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable
just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg
i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away
i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so
i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me
there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet
i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son
the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other
i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting
then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane
i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken
boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt
when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue
on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out
i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in
i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred
a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected
he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent
so far i was clear
the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet
it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids
but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place
there could be no possible reason
as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one
when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty
and who could it be who was her confederate
a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you
i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one
but among them was sir george burnwell
i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women
it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems
even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family
well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next
i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george's house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes
with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks
i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder
precisely
it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes
it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter
i went and saw him
at first of course he denied everything
but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall
i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike
then he became a little more reasonable
i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held pounds apiece
that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown
'why dash it all'
said he 'i've let them go at six hundred for the three'
i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution
off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at  pounds apiece
then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock after what i may call a really hard day's work
a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising
sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done
your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it
and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him
as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart
not even your skill can inform me where she is now
i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is
it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
xii
the adventure of the copper beeches  to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived
it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes clbres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province
and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records
you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing
it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character
no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words
if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself
crime is common
logic is rare
therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell
you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street
a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths
our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet
sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all
the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law
but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial
the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest
pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction
but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past
man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality
as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools
i think that i have touched bottom at last however
this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy
read it
he tossed a crumpled letter across to me
it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus  dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess
i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do not inconvenience you
yours faithfully                                                violet hunter
do you know the young lady
i asked
not i
it is halfpast ten now
yes and i have no doubt that is her ring
it may turn out to be of more interest than you think
you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation
it may be so in this case also
well let us hope so
but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question
as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room
she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plover's egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world
you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do
pray take a seat miss hunter
i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you
i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client
he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story
i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation
i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success
at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wit's end as to what i should do
there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called westaway's and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me
westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper
she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them
well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone
a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered
as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper
'that will do' said he 'i could not ask for anything better
capital
capital'
he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion
he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him
'you are looking for a situation miss'
he asked
'yes sir'
'as governess'
'yes sir'
'and what salary do you ask'
'i had  pounds a month in my last place with colonel spence munro'
'oh tut tut
sweatingrank sweating'
he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion
'how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments'
'my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine' said i
'a little french a little german music and drawing'  'tut tut'
he cried
'this is all quite beside the question
the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady
there it is in a nutshell
if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country
but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures
your salary with me madam would commence at  pounds a year'
you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true
the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note
'it is also my custom' said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe'
it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man
as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself
'may i ask where you live sir'
said i
'hampshire
charming rural place
the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester
it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse'
'and my duties sir
i should be glad to know what they would be'
'one childone dear little romper just six years old
oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper
smack
smack
smack
three gone before you could wink'
he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again
i was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking
'my sole duties then' i asked 'are to take charge of a single child'
'no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady' he cried
'your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey
you see no difficulty heh'
'i should be happy to make myself useful'
'quite so
in dress now for example
we are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted
if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim
heh'
'no' said i considerably astonished at his words
'or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you'
'oh no'
'or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us'
i could hardly believe my ears
as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut
it has been considered artistic
i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
'i am afraid that that is quite impossible' said i
he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke
'i am afraid that it is quite essential' said he
'it is a little fancy of my wife's and ladies' fancies you know madam ladies' fancies must be consulted
and so you won't cut your hair'
'no sir i really could not' i answered firmly
'ah very well then that quite settles the matter
it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely
in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies'
the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
'do you desire your name to be kept upon the books'
she asked
'if you please miss stoper'
'well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion' said she sharply
'you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you
goodday to you miss hunter'
she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page
well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing
after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity
very few governesses in england are getting  pounds a year
besides what use was my hair to me
many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number
next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it
i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself
i have it here and i will read it to you                         'the copper beeches near winchester
'dear miss huntermiss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision
my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you
we are willing to give  pounds a quarter or  pounds a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you
they are not very exacting after all
my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think fit you very well
then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience
as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light
now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dogcart at winchester
let me know your train
yours faithfully jephro rucastle'
that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it
i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling
but you would not advise me to refuse
i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for
what is the meaning of it all mr
holmes
ah i have no data
i cannot tell
perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
well there seems to me to be only one possible solution
mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man
is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak
that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one
but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
but the money mr holmes the money
well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good
that is what makes me uneasy
why should they give you  pounds a year when they could have their pick for  pounds
there must be some strong reason behind
i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help
i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me
oh you may carry that feeling away with you
i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months
there is something distinctly novel about some of the features
if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger  danger
what danger do you foresee
holmes shook his head gravely
it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he
but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help
that is enough
she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now
i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester tomorrow
with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way
at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself
and she would need to be said holmes gravely
i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past
it was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine
as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it
data
data
data
he cried impatiently
i can't make bricks without clay
and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation
the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning
he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me
just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies
the summons was a brief and urgent one
please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said
do come
i am at my wit's end
hunter
will you come with me
asked holmes glancing up
i should wish to
just look it up then
there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw
it is due at winchester at 
that will do very nicely
then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning
by eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital
holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery
it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east
the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a man's energy
all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
are they not fresh and beautiful
i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street
but holmes shook his head gravely
do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject
you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty
i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there
good heavens
i cried
who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
they always fill me with a certain horror
it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
you horrify me
but the reason is very obvious
the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish
there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkard's blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock
but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law
think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser
had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her
it is the five miles of country which makes the danger
still it is clear that she is not personally threatened
no
if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away
quite so
she has her freedom
what can be the matter then
can you suggest no explanation
i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them
but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us
well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell
the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us
she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table
i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly
it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do
your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
pray tell us what has happened to you
i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three
i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose
let us have everything in its due order
holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen
in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle
it is only fair to them to say that
but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them
what can you not understand
their reasons for their conduct
but you shall have it all just as it occurred
when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches
it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather
there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door
this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southerton's preserves
a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child
there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street
mrs rucastle is not mad
i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive
from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia
mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother
as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife
mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature
she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse
she was a nonentity
it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son
her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible
he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple
and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman
she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face
more than once i have surprised her in tears
i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature
he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking
giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects
but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story
i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not
i shall try not to miss anything of importance
the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants
there are only two a man and his wife
toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink
twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it
his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable
they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building
for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
'oh yes' said he turning to me 'we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair
i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance
we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you
you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged'
the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue
it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before
it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it
both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence
they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor
a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it
in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to
you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary
mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face
after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery
two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances
again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense rpertoire and which he told inimitably
then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him
i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress
you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be
they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back
at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means
my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief
on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me
i confess that i was disappointed
there was nothing
at least that was my first impression
at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction
the road is an important highway and there are usually people there
this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up
i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze
she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me
she rose at once
'jephro' said she 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter'
'no friend of yours miss hunter'
he asked
'no i know no one in these parts'
'dear me
how very impertinent
kindly turn round and motion to him to go away'
'surely it would be better to take no notice'
'no no we should have him loitering here always
kindly turn round and wave him away like that'
i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind
that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road
pray continue said holmes
your narrative promises to be a most interesting one
you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak
on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door
as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about
'look in here'
said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks
'is he not a beauty'
i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
'don't be frightened' said my employer laughing at the start which i had given
'it's only carlo my mastiff
i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him
we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard
toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon
for goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for it's as much as your life is worth'
the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day
i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches
as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was
it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones
it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side
that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done
and now i have a very strange experience to tell you
i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk
one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things
there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked
i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it
the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open
there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was
it was my coil of hair
i took it up and examined it
it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness
but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me
how could my hair have been locked in the drawer
with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair
i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical
was it not extraordinary
puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant
i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked
i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all
a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked
one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed
his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion
he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look
this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house
there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up
they were evidently all deserted
as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever
'ah'
said he 'you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady
i was preoccupied with business matters'
i assured him that i was not offended
'by the way' said i 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up'
he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark
'photography is one of my hobbies' said he
'i have made my dark room up there
but dear me
what an observant young lady we have come upon
who would have believed it
who would have ever believed it'
he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me
i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest
well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them
it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that
it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place
they talk of woman's instinct perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling
at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door
it was only yesterday that the chance came
i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door
recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door
i have no doubt at all that he had left it there
mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity
i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through
there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end
round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open
they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them
the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord
the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there
this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness
evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above
as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door
a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes
my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress
i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside
'so' said he smiling 'it was you then
i thought that it must be when i saw the door open'
'oh i am so frightened'
i panted
'my dear young lady
my dear young lady'
you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was'and what has frightened you my dear young lady'
but his voice was just a little too coaxing
he overdid it
i was keenly on my guard against him
'i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing' i answered
'but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again
oh it is so dreadfully still in there'
'only that'
said he looking at me keenly
'why what did you think'
i asked
'why do you think that i lock this door'
'i am sure that i do not know'
'it is to keep people out who have no business there
do you see'
he was still smiling in the most amiable manner
'i am sure if i had known'  'well then you know now
and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demon'i'll throw you to the mastiff'
i was so terrified that i do not know what i did
i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room
i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
then i thought of you mr holmes
i could not live there longer without some advice
i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child
they were all horrible to me
if i could only bring you down all would be well
of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears
my mind was soon made up
i would send you a wire
i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier
a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free
i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three o'clock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child
now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do
holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
is toller still drunk
he asked
yes
i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him
that is well
and the rucastles go out tonight
yes
is there a cellar with a good strong lock
yes the winecellar
you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter
do you think that you could perform one more feat
i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman
i will try
what is it
we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o'clock my friend and i
the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable
there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm
if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely
i will do it
excellent
we shall then look thoroughly into the affair
of course there is only one feasible explanation
you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
that is obvious
as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america
you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair
hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also
by a curious chance you came upon her tresses
the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fiancand no doubt as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions
the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her
so much is fairly clear
the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
what on earth has that to do with it
i ejaculated
my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
don't you see that the converse is equally valid
i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children
this child's disposition is abnormally cruel merely for cruelty's sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client
a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it
oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man
we can do nothing until seven o'clock
at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse
the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep
have you managed it
asked holmes
a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
that is mrs toller in the cellar said she
her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr
rucastle's
you have done well indeed
cried holmes with enthusiasm
now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described
holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar
then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success
no sound came from within and at the silence holmes' face clouded over
i trust that we are not too late said he
i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you
now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength
together we rushed into the room
it was empty
there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen
the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone
there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off
but how
through the skylight
we shall soon see how he managed it
he swung himself up onto the roof
ah yes he cried here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
that is how he did it
but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away
he has come back and done it
i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man
i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair
i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand
miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him
you villain
said he where's your daughter
the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight
it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves
spies and thieves
i have caught you have i
you are in my power
i'll serve you
he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
he's gone for the dog
cried miss hunter
i have my revolver said i
better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together
we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to
an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
my god
he cried
someone has loosed the dog
it's not been fed for two days
quick quick or it'll be too late
holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us
there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastle's throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground
running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house
we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain
we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room
mrs
toller
cried miss hunter
yes miss
mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you
ah miss it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted
ha
said holmes looking keenly at her
it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else
yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know
then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark
i will soon make it clear to you said she and i'd have done so before now if i could ha' got out from the cellar
if there's policecourt business over this you'll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alice's friend too
she was never happy at home miss alice wasn't from the time that her father married again
she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friend's house
as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastle's hands
he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it
he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money
when she wouldn't do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at death's door
then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didn't make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be
ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains
mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment
yes sir
and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr
fowler
that was it sir
but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his
mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely
and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
you have it sir just as it happened
i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us
and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife
they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them
mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius
as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success
chapter 
mr sherlock holmes    mr sherlock holmes who was usually very late in the mornings save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night was seated at the breakfast table
i stood upon the hearthrug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before
it was a fine thick piece of wood bulbousheaded of the sort which is known as a penang lawyer just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across
to james mortimer mrcs from his friends of the cch was engraved upon it with the date  it was just such a stick as the oldfashioned family practitioner used to carrydignified solid and reassuring
well watson what do you make of it  holmes was sitting with his back to me and i had given him no sign of my occupation
how did you know what i was doing
i believe you have eyes in the back of your head  i have at least a wellpolished silverplated coffeepot in front of me said he
but tell me watson what do you make of our visitors stick
since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir becomes of importance
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it  i think said i following as far as i could the methods of my companion that dr mortimer is a successful elderly medical man wellesteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation  good said holmes
excellent  i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot  why so  because this stick though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it
the thickiron ferrule is worn down so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it  perfectly sound said holmes
and then again there is the friends of the cch i should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance and which has made him a small presentation in return  really watson you excel yourself said holmes pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette
i am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities
it may be that you are not yourself luminous but you are a conductor of light
some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it
i confess my dear fellow that i am very much in your debt  he had never said as much before and i must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure for i had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had made to give publicity to his methods
i was proud too to think that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval
he now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes
then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and carrying the cane to the window he looked over it again with a convex lens
interesting though elementary said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee
there are certainly one or two indications upon the stick
it gives us the basis for several deductions  has anything escaped me i asked with some selfimportance
i trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have overlooked  i am afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusions were erroneous
when i said that you stimulated me i meant to be frank that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth
not that you are entirely wrong in this instance
the man is certainly a country practitioner
and he walks a good deal  then i was right  to that extent  but that was all  no no my dear watson not allby no means all
i would suggest for example that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt and that when the initials cc are placed before that hospital the words charing cross very naturally suggest themselves  you may be right  the probability lies in that direction
and if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor  well then supposing that cch does stand for charing cross hospital what further inferences may we draw  do none suggest themselves
you know my methods
apply them  i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country  i think that we might venture a little farther than this
look at it in this light
on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made
when would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will
obviously at the moment when dr mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself
we know there has been a presentation
we believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice
is it then stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change  it certainly seems probable  now you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital since only a man wellestablished in a london practice could hold such a position and such a one would not drift into the country
what was he then
if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a housesurgeon or a housephysicianlittle more than a senior student
and he left five years agothe date is on the stick
so your grave middleaged family practitioner vanishes into thin air my dear watson and there emerges a young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absentminded and the possessor of a favourite dog which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff  i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling
as to the latter part i have no means of checking you said i but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the mans age and professional career from my small medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the name
there were several mortimers but only one who could be our visitor
i read his record aloud
mortimer james mrcs  grimpen dartmoor devon
housesurgeon from  to  at charing cross hospital
winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology         with essay entitled is disease a reversion  corresponding         member of the swedish pathological society
author of         some freaks of atavism lancet 
do we progress         journal of psychology march 
medical officer         for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow  no mention of that local hunt watson said holmes with a mischievous smile but a country doctor as you very astutely observed
i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences
as to the adjectives i said if i remember right amiable unambitious and absentminded
it is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials only an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country and only an absentminded one who leaves his stick and not his visitingcard after waiting an hour in your room  and the dog  has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master
being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible
the dogs jaw as shown in the space between these marks is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff
it may have beenyes by jove it is a curlyhaired spaniel  he had risen and paced the room as he spoke
now he halted in the recess of the window
there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glanced up in surprise
my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that  for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very doorstep and there is the ring of its owner
dont move i beg you watson
he is a professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me
now is the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life and you know not whether for good or ill what does dr james mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime
come in  the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me since i had expected a typical country practitioner
he was a very tall thin man with a long nose like a beak which jutted out between two keen gray eyes set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of goldrimmed glasses
he was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frockcoat was dingy and his trousers frayed
though young his long back was already bowed and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence
as he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in holmess hand and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy
i am so very glad said he
i was not sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office
i would not lose that stick for the world  a presentation i see said holmes
yes sir  from charing cross hospital  from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage  dear dear thats bad said holmes shaking his head
dr mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment
why was it bad  only that you have disarranged our little deductions
your marriage you say  yes sir
i married and so left the hospital and with it all hopes of a consulting practice
it was necessary to make a home of my own  come come we are not so far wrong after all said holmes
and now dr james mortimer  mister sir mistera humble mrcs  and a man of precise mind evidently  a dabbler in science mr holmes a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean
i presume that it is mr sherlock holmes whom i am addressing and not  no this is my friend dr watson  glad to meet you sir
i have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend
you interest me very much mr holmes
i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such wellmarked supraorbital development
would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure
a cast of your skull sir until the original is available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum
it is not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull  sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair
you are an enthusiast in your line of thought i perceive sir as i am in mine said he
i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes
have no hesitation in lighting one  the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity
he had long quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect
holmes was silent but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion
i presume sir said he at last that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today  no sir no though i am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well
i came to you mr holmes because i recognized that i am myself an unpractical man and because i am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem
recognizing as i do that you are the second highest expert in europe  indeed sir
may i inquire who has the honour to be the first asked holmes with some asperity
to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly  then had you not better consult him  i said sir to the precisely scientific mind
but as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone
i trust sir that i have not inadvertently  just a little said holmes
i think dr mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance     chapter 
the curse of the baskervilles    i have in my pocket a manuscript said dr james mortimer
i observed it as you entered the room said holmes
it is an old manuscript  early eighteenth century unless it is a forgery  how can you say that sir  you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking
it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so
you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject
i put that at   the exact date is  dr mortimer drew it from his breastpocket
this family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in devonshire
i may say that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant
he was a strongminded man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as i am myself
yet he took this document very seriously and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him  holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee
you will observe watson the alternative use of the long s and the short
it is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date  i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script
at the head was written baskerville hall and below in large scrawling figures   it appears to be a statement of some sort  yes it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the baskerville family  but i understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me  most modern
a most practical pressing matter which must be decided within twentyfour hours
but the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair
with your permission i will read it to you  holmes leaned back in his chair placed his fingertips together and closed his eyes with an air of resignation
dr mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high cracking voice the following curious oldworld narrative          of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there         have been many statements yet as i come in a direct         line from hugo baskerville and as i had the story from         my father who also had it from his i have set it down         with all belief that it occurred even as is here set         forth
and i would have you believe my sons that the         same justice which punishes sin may also most graciously         forgive it and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer         and repentance it may be removed
learn then from this         story not to fear the fruits of the past but rather to         be circumspect in the future that those foul passions         whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not         again be loosed to our undoing
know then that in the time of the great rebellion the         history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most         earnestly commend to your attention this manor of         baskerville was held by hugo of that name nor can it be         gainsaid that he was a most wild profane and godless         man
this in truth his neighbours might have pardoned         seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts         but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour         which made his name a byword through the west
it         chanced that this hugo came to love if indeed so dark         a passion may be known under so bright a name the daughter         of a yeoman who held lands near the baskerville estate
but the young maiden being discreet and of good repute         would ever avoid him for she feared his evil name
so         it came to pass that one michaelmas this hugo with five         or six of his idle and wicked companions stole down upon         the farm and carried off the maiden her father and         brothers being from home as he well knew
when they had         brought her to the hall the maiden was placed in an upper         chamber while hugo and his friends sat down to a long         carouse as was their nightly custom
now the poor lass         upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing         and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from         below for they say that the words used by hugo baskerville         when he was in wine were such as might blast the man who         said them
at last in the stress of her fear she did that         which might have daunted the bravest or most active man         for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered and         still covers the south wall she came down from under the         eaves and so homeward across the moor there being three         leagues betwixt the hall and her fathers farm
it chanced that some little time later hugo left his         guests to carry food and drinkwith other worse things         perchanceto his captive and so found the cage empty         and the bird escaped
then as it would seem he became         as one that hath a devil for rushing down the stairs         into the dininghall he sprang upon the great table         flagons and trenchers flying before him and he cried         aloud before all the company that he would that very         night render his body and soul to the powers of evil if         he might but overtake the wench
and while the revellers         stood aghast at the fury of the man one more wicked or         it may be more drunken than the rest cried out that         they should put the hounds upon her
whereat hugo ran         from the house crying to his grooms that they should         saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and giving the         hounds a kerchief of the maids he swung them to the         line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor
now for some space the revellers stood agape unable         to understand all that had been done in such haste
but         anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed         which was like to be done upon the moorlands
everything         was now in an uproar some calling for their pistols         some for their horses and some for another flask of         wine
but at length some sense came back to their crazed         minds and the whole of them thirteen in number took         horse and started in pursuit
the moon shone clear above         them and they rode swiftly abreast taking that course         which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach         her own home
they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the         night shepherds upon the moorlands and they cried to         him to know if he had seen the hunt
and the man as         the story goes was so crazed with fear that he could         scarce speak but at last he said that he had indeed seen         the unhappy maiden with the hounds upon her track
but         i have seen more than that said he for hugo baskerville         passed me upon his black mare and there ran mute behind         him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at         my heels  so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd         and rode onward
but soon their skins turned cold for         there came a galloping across the moor and the black         mare dabbled with white froth went past with trailing         bridle and empty saddle
then the revellers rode close         together for a great fear was on them but they still         followed over the moor though each had he been alone         would have been right glad to have turned his horses         head
riding slowly in this fashion they came at last         upon the hounds
these though known for their valour         and their breed were whimpering in a cluster at the         head of a deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the         moor some slinking away and some with starting hackles         and staring eyes gazing down the narrow valley before them
the company had come to a halt more sober men as you         may guess than when they started
the most of them         would by no means advance but three of them the boldest         or it may be the most drunken rode forward down the goyal
now it opened into a broad space in which stood two of         those great stones still to be seen there which were         set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old
the moon was shining bright upon the clearing and there         in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen         dead of fear and of fatigue
but it was not the sight         of her body nor yet was it that of the body of hugo         baskerville lying near her which raised the hair upon         the heads of these three daredevil roysterers but it         was that standing over hugo and plucking at his throat         there stood a foul thing a great black beast shaped         like a hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal         eye has rested upon
and even as they looked the thing         tore the throat out of hugo baskerville on which as it         turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them the         three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life still         screaming across the moor
one it is said died that         very night of what he had seen and the other twain were         but broken men for the rest of their days
such is the tale my sons of the coming of the hound         which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever         since
if i have set it down it is because that which         is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but         hinted at and guessed
nor can it be denied that many         of the family have been unhappy in their deaths which         have been sudden bloody and mysterious
yet may we         shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence         which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that         third or fourth generation which is threatened in holy         writ
to that providence my sons i hereby commend         you and i counsel you by way of caution to forbear from         crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of         evil are exalted
this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john         with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their         sister elizabeth
  when dr mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr sherlock holmes
the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire
well said he
do you not find it interesting  to a collector of fairy tales  dr mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket
now mr holmes we will give you something a little more recent
this is the devon county chronicle of may th of this year
it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that date  my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent
our visitor readjusted his glasses and began          the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville whose         name has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate         for middevon at the next election has cast a gloom over         the county
though sir charles had resided at baskerville         hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of         character and extreme generosity had won the affection         and respect of all who had been brought into contact with         him
in these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing         to find a case where the scion of an old county family         which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own         fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the         fallen grandeur of his line
sir charles as is well known         made large sums of money in south african speculation
more wise than those who go on until the wheel turns         against them he realized his gains and returned to england         with them
it is only two years since he took up his         residence at baskerville hall and it is common talk how         large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement         which have been interrupted by his death
being himself         childless it was his openly expressed desire that the         whole countryside should within his own lifetime profit         by his good fortune and many will have personal reasons         for bewailing his untimely end
his generous donations         to local and county charities have been frequently         chronicled in these columns
the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles         cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the         inquest but at least enough has been done to dispose of         those rumours to which local superstition has given rise
there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to         imagine that death could be from any but natural causes
sir charles was a widower and a man who may be said to         have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind
in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his         personal tastes and his indoor servants at baskerville         hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore the         husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper
their evidence corroborated by that of several friends         tends to show that sir charless health has for some time         been impaired and points especially to some affection         of the heart manifesting itself in changes of colour         breathlessness and acute attacks of nervous depression
dr james mortimer the friend and medical attendant of         the deceased has given evidence to the same effect
the facts of the case are simple
sir charles baskerville         was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking         down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall
the evidence         of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom
on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his intention         of starting next day for london and had ordered barrymore         to prepare his luggage
that night he went out as usual         for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he was in         the habit of smoking a cigar
he never returned
at         twelve oclock barrymore finding the hall door still open         became alarmed and lighting a lantern went in search         of his master
the day had been wet and sir charless         footmarks were easily traced down the alley
halfway down         this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor
there were indications that sir charles had stood for some         little time here
he then proceeded down the alley and         it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered
one fact which has not been explained is the statement         of barrymore that his masters footprints altered their         character from the time that he passed the moorgate and         that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking         upon his toes
one murphy a gipsy horsedealer was on         the moor at no great distance at the time but he appears         by his own confession to have been the worse for drink
he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state         from what direction they came
no signs of violence were         to be discovered upon sir charless person and though         the doctors evidence pointed to an almost incredible         facial distortionso great that dr mortimer refused at         first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient         who lay before himit was explained that that is a symptom         which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from         cardiac exhaustion
this explanation was borne out by         the postmortem examination which showed longstanding         organic disease and the coroners jury returned a         verdict in accordance with the medical evidence
it is         well that this is so for it is obviously of the utmost         importance that sir charless heir should settle at the         hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly         interrupted
had the prosaic finding of the coroner not         finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been         whispered in connection with the affair it might have been         difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall
it is         understood that the next of kin is mr henry baskerville         if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskervilles         younger brother
the young man when last heard of was         in america and inquiries are being instituted with a         view to informing him of his good fortune  dr mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket
those are the public facts mr holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville  i must thank you said sherlock holmes for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest
i had observed some newspaper comment at the time but i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch with several interesting english cases
this article you say contains all the public facts  it does  then let me have the private ones he leaned back put his fingertips together and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression
in doing so said dr mortimer who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion i am telling that which i have not confided to anyone
my motive for withholding it from the coroners inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition
i had the further motive that baskerville hall as the paper says would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less than i knew since no practical good could result from it but with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank
the moor is very sparsely inhabited and those who live near each other are thrown very much together
for this reason i saw a good deal of sir charles baskerville
with the exception of mr frankland of lafter hall and mr stapleton the naturalist there are no other men of education within many miles
sir charles was a retiring man but the chance of his illness brought us together and a community of interests in science kept us so
he had brought back much scientific information from south africa and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot
within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that sir charless nervous system was strained to the breaking point
he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly to heartso much so that although he would walk in his own grounds nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night
incredible as it may appear to you mr holmes he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging
the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound
the latter question he put to me several times and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement
i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event
he chanced to be at his hall door
i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him when i saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror
i whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which i took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive
so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it
it was gone however and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind
i stayed with him all the evening and it was on that occasion to explain the emotion which he had shown that he confided to my keeping that narrative which i read to you when first i came
i mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed but i was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification
it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london
his heart was i knew affected and the constant anxiety in which he lived however chimerical the cause of it might be was evidently having a serious effect upon his health
i thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man
mr stapleton a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health was of the same opinion
at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe
on the night of sir charless death barrymore the butler who made the discovery sent perkins the groom on horseback to me and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event
i checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest
i followed the footsteps down the yew alley i saw the spot at the moorgate where he seemed to have waited i remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point i noted that there were no other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally i carefully examined the body which had not been touched until my arrival
sir charles lay on his face his arms out his fingers dug into the ground and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn to his identity
there was certainly no physical injury of any kind
but one false statement was made by barrymore at the inquest
he said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body
he did not observe any
but i didsome little distance off but fresh and clear  footprints  footprints  a mans or a womans  dr mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered
mr
holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound     chapter 
the problem    i confess at these words a shudder passed through me
there was a thrill in the doctors voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us
holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested
you saw this  as clearly as i see you  and you said nothing  what was the use  how was it that no one else saw it  the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought
i dont suppose i should have done so had i not known this legend  there are many sheepdogs on the moor  no doubt but this was no sheepdog  you say it was large  enormous  but it had not approached the body  no  what sort of night was it  damp and raw  but not actually raining  no  what is the alley like  there are two lines of old yew hedge twelve feet high and impenetrable
the walk in the centre is about eight feet across  is there anything between the hedges and the walk  yes there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side  i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate  yes the wicketgate which leads on to the moor  is there any other opening  none  so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moorgate  there is an exit through a summerhouse at the far end  had sir charles reached this  no he lay about fifty yards from it  now tell me dr mortimerand this is importantthe marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass  no marks could show on the grass  were they on the same side of the path as the moorgate  yes they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moorgate  you interest me exceedingly
another point
was the wicketgate closed  closed and padlocked  how high was it  about four feet high  then anyone could have got over it  yes  and what marks did you see by the wicketgate  none in particular  good heaven
did no one examine  yes i examined myself  and found nothing  it was all very confused
sir charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes  how do you know that  because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar  excellent
this is a colleague watson after our own heart
but the marks  he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel
i could discern no others  sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture
if i had only been there he cried
it is evidently a case of extraordinary interest and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert
that gravel page upon which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants
oh dr mortimer dr mortimer to think that you should not have called me in
you have indeed much to answer for  i could not call you in mr holmes without disclosing these facts to the world and i have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so
besides besides  why do you hesitate  there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless  you mean that the thing is supernatural  i did not positively say so  no but you evidently think it  since the tragedy mr holmes there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of nature  for example  i find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal known to science
they all agreed that it was a huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral
i have crossexamined these men one of them a hardheaded countryman one a farrier and one a moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly corresponding to the hellhound of the legend
i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night  and you a trained man of science believe it to be supernatural  i do not know what to believe  holmes shrugged his shoulders
i have hitherto confined my investigations to this world said he
in a modest way i have combated evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious a task
yet you must admit that the footmark is material  the original hound was material enough to tug a mans throat out and yet he was diabolical as well  i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists
but now dr mortimer tell me this
if you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all
you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate sir charless death and that you desire me to do it  i did not say that i desired you to do it  then how can i assist you  by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville who arrives at waterloo stationdr mortimer looked at his watchin exactly one hour and a quarter  he being the heir  yes
on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada
from the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way
i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of sir charless will  there is no other claimant i presume  none
the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder
the second brother who died young is the father of this lad henry
the third rodger was the black sheep of the family
he came of the old masterful baskerville strain and was the very image they tell me of the family picture of old hugo
he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and died there in  of yellow fever
henry is the last of the baskervilles
in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station
i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this morning
now mr holmes what would you advise me to do with him  why should he not go to the home of his fathers  it seems natural does it not
and yet consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate
i feel sure that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place
and yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depends upon his presence
all the good work which has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall
i fear lest i should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that is why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice  holmes considered for a little time
put into plain words the matter is this said he
in your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an unsafe abode for a baskervillethat is your opinion  at least i might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so  exactly
but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire
a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing  you put the matter more flippantly mr holmes than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things
your advice then as i understand it is that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london
he comes in fifty minutes
what would you recommend  i recommend sir that you take a cab call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville  and then  and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up my mind about the matter  how long will it take you to make up your mind  twentyfour hours
at ten oclock tomorrow dr mortimer i will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you  i will do so mr holmes he scribbled the appointment on his shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange peering absentminded fashion
holmes stopped him at the head of the stair
only one more question dr mortimer
you say that before sir charles baskervilles death several people saw this apparition upon the moor  three people did  did any see it after  i have not heard of any  thank you
goodmorning  holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him
going out watson  unless i can help you  no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid
but this is splendid really unique from some points of view
when you pass bradleys would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco
thank you
it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening
then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning  i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence constructed alternative theories balanced one against the other and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial
i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until evening
it was nearly nine oclock when i found myself in the sittingroom once more
my first impression as i opened the door was that a fire had broken out for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it
as i entered however my fears were set at rest for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing
through the haze i had a vague vision of holmes in his dressinggown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips
several rolls of paper lay around him
caught cold watson said he
no its this poisonous atmosphere  i suppose it is pretty thick now that you mention it  thick
it is intolerable  open the window then
you have been at your club all day i perceive  my dear holmes  am i right  certainly but how  he laughed at my bewildered expression
there is a delightful freshness about you watson which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense
a gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day
he returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots
he has been a fixture therefore all day
he is not a man with intimate friends
where then could he have been
is it not obvious  well it is rather obvious  the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes
where do you think that i have been  a fixture also  on the contrary i have been to devonshire  in spirit  exactly
my body has remained in this armchair and has i regret to observe consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco
after you left i sent down to stamfords for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit has hovered over it all day
i flatter myself that i could find my way about  a largescale map i presume  very large  he unrolled one section and held it over his knee
here you have the particular district which concerns us
that is baskerville hall in the middle  with a wood round it  exactly
i fancy the yew alley though not marked under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you perceive upon the right of it
this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr mortimer has his headquarters
within a radius of five miles there are as you see only a very few scattered dwellings
here is lafter hall which was mentioned in the narrative
there is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturaliststapleton if i remember right was his name
here are two moorland farmhouses high tor and foulmire
then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown
between and around these scattered points extends the desolate lifeless moor
this then is the stage upon which tragedy has been played and upon which we may help to play it again  it must be a wild place  yes the setting is a worthy one
if the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men  then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation  the devils agents may be of flesh and blood may they not
there are two questions waiting for us at the outset
the one is whether any crime has been committed at all the second is what is the crime and how was it committed
of course if dr mortimers surmise should be correct and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature there is an end of our investigation
but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one
i think well shut that window again if you dont mind
it is a singular thing but i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought
i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think but that is the logical outcome of my convictions
have you turned the case over in your mind  yes i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day  what do you make of it  it is very bewildering  it has certainly a character of its own
there are points of distinction about it
that change in the footprints for example
what do you make of that  mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley  he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest
why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley  what then  he was running watsonrunning desperately running for his life running until he burst his heartand fell dead upon his face  running from what  there lies our problem
there are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run  how can you say that  i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor
if that were so and it seems most probable only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it
if the gipsys evidence may be taken as true he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be
then again whom was he waiting for that night and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house  you think that he was waiting for someone  the man was elderly and infirm
we can understand his taking an evening stroll but the ground was damp and the night inclement
is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as dr mortimer with more practical sense than i should have given him credit for deduced from the cigar ash  but he went out every evening  i think it unlikely that he waited at the moorgate every evening
on the contrary the evidence is that he avoided the moor
that night he waited there
it was the night before he made his departure for london
the thing takes shape watson
it becomes coherent
might i ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning     chapter 
sir henry baskerville    our breakfast table was cleared early and holmes waited in his dressinggown for the promised interview
our clients were punctual to their appointment for the clock had just struck ten when dr mortimer was shown up followed by the young baronet
the latter was a small alert darkeyed man about thirty years of age very sturdily built with thick black eyebrows and a strong pugnacious face
he wore a ruddytinted tweed suit and had the weatherbeaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman
this is sir henry baskerville said dr mortimer
why yes said he and the strange thing is mr sherlock holmes that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning i should have come on my own account
i understand that you think out little puzzles and ive had one this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give it  pray take a seat sir henry
do i understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london  nothing of much importance mr holmes
only a joke as like as not
it was this letter if you can call it a letter which reached me this morning  he laid an envelope upon the table and we all bent over it
it was of common quality grayish in colour
the address sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel was printed in rough characters the postmark charing cross and the date of posting the preceding evening
who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel asked holmes glancing keenly across at our visitor
no one could have known
we only decided after i met dr mortimer  but dr mortimer was no doubt already stopping there  no i had been staying with a friend said the doctor
there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel  hum
someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements out of the envelope he took a halfsheet of foolscap paper folded into four
this he opened and spread flat upon the table
across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it
it ran          as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor
the word moor only was printed in ink
now said sir henry baskerville perhaps you will tell me mr holmes what in thunder is the meaning of that and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs  what do you make of it dr mortimer
you must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this at any rate  no sir but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural  what business asked sir henry sharply
it seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs  you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry
i promise you that said sherlock holmes
we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening
have you yesterdays times watson  it is here in the corner  might i trouble you for itthe inside page please with the leading articles he glanced swiftly over it running his eyes up and down the columns
capital article this on free trade
permit me to give you an extract from it
you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special      trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a      protective tariff but it stands to reason that such      legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the      country diminish the value of our imports and lower the      general conditions of life in this island  what do you think of that watson cried holmes in high glee rubbing his hands together with satisfaction
dont you think that is an admirable sentiment  dr mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest and sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me
i dont know much about the tariff and things of that kind said he but it seems to me weve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned  on the contrary i think we are particularly hot upon the trail sir henry
watson here knows more about my methods than you do but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence  no i confess that i see no connection  and yet my dear watson there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other
you your your life reason value keep away from the dont you see now whence these words have been taken  by thunder youre right
well if that isnt smart cried sir henry
if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that keep away and from the are cut out in one piece  well nowso it is  really mr holmes this exceeds anything which i could have imagined  said dr mortimer gazing at my friend in amazement
i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper but that you should name which and add that it came from the leading article is really one of the most remarkable things which i have ever known
how did you do it  i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau  most certainly  but how  because that is my special hobby
the differences are obvious
the supraorbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the  but this is my special hobby and the differences are equally obvious
there is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a times article and the slovenly print of an evening halfpenny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau
the detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime though i confess that once when i was very young i confused the leeds mercury with the western morning news
but a times leader is entirely distinctive and these words could have been taken from nothing else
as it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterdays issue  so far as i can follow you then mr holmes said sir henry baskerville someone cut out this message with a scissors  nailscissors said holmes
you can see that it was a very shortbladed scissors since the cutter had to take two snips over keep away  that is so
someone then cut out the message with a pair of shortbladed scissors pasted it with paste  gum said holmes
with gum on to the paper
but i want to know why the word moor should have been written  because he could not find it in print
the other words were all simple and might be found in any issue but moor would be less common  why of course that would explain it
have you read anything else in this message mr holmes  there are one or two indications and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues
the address you observe is printed in rough characters
but the times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated
we may take it therefore that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known or come to be known by you
again you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line but that some are much higher than others
life for example is quite out of its proper place
that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter
on the whole i incline to the latter view since the matter was evidently important and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless
if he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry since any letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel
did the composer fear an interruptionand from whom  we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork said dr mortimer
say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely
it is the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation
now you would call it a guess no doubt but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel  how in the world can you say that  if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble
the pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address showing that there was very little ink in the bottle
now a private pen or inkbottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state and the combination of the two must be quite rare
but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get anything else
yes i have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the wastepaper baskets of the hotels around charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message
halloa
halloa
whats this  he was carefully examining the foolscap upon which the words were pasted holding it only an inch or two from his eyes
well  nothing said he throwing it down
it is a blank halfsheet of paper without even a watermark upon it
i think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in london  why no mr holmes
i think not  you have not observed anyone follow or watch you  i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel said our visitor
why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me  we are coming to that
you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter  well it depends upon what you think worth reporting  i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting  sir henry smiled
i dont know much of british life yet for i have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada
but i hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here  you have lost one of your boots  my dear sir cried dr mortimer it is only mislaid
you will find it when you return to the hotel
what is the use of troubling mr holmes with trifles of this kind  well he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine  exactly said holmes however foolish the incident may seem
you have lost one of your boots you say  well mislaid it anyhow
i put them both outside my door last night and there was only one in the morning
i could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them
the worst of it is that i only bought the pair last night in the strand and i have never had them on  if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be cleaned  they were tan boots and had never been varnished
that was why i put them out  then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots  i did a good deal of shopping
dr mortimer here went round with me
you see if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways out west
among other things i bought these brown bootsgave six dollars for themand had one stolen before ever i had them on my feet  it seems a singularly useless thing to steal said sherlock holmes
i confess that i share dr mortimers belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found  and now gentlemen said the baronet with decision it seems to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know
it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at  your request is a very reasonable one holmes answered
dr
mortimer i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us  thus encouraged our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before
sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise
well i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance said he when the long narrative was finished
of course ive heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery
its the pet story of the family though i never thought of taking it seriously before
but as to my uncles deathwell it all seems boiling up in my head and i cant get it clear yet
you dont seem quite to have made up your mind whether its a case for a policeman or a clergyman  precisely  and now theres this affair of the letter to me at the hotel
i suppose that fits into its place  it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor said dr mortimer
and also said holmes that someone is not illdisposed towards you since they warn you of danger  or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away  well of course that is possible also
i am very much indebted to you dr mortimer for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives
but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall  why should i not go  there seems to be danger  do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings  well that is what we have to find out  whichever it is my answer is fixed
there is no devil in hell mr holmes and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer  his dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke
it was evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative
meanwhile said he i have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me
its a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting
i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind
now look here mr holmes its halfpast eleven now and i am going back right away to my hotel
suppose you and your friend dr watson come round and lunch with us at two
ill be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me  is that convenient to you watson  perfectly  then you may expect us
shall i have a cab called  id prefer to walk for this affair has flurried me rather  ill join you in a walk with pleasure said his companion
then we meet again at two oclock
au revoir and goodmorning  we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door
in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action
your hat and boots watson quick
not a moment to lose he rushed into his room in his dressinggown and was back again in a few seconds in a frockcoat
we hurried together down the stairs and into the street
dr mortimer and baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street
shall i run on and stop them  not for the world my dear watson
i am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine
our friends are wise for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk  he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half
then still keeping a hundred yards behind we followed into oxford street and so down regent street
once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window upon which holmes did the same
an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction and following the direction of his eager eyes i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again
theres our man watson
come along
well have a good look at him if we can do no more  at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab
instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up something was screamed to the driver and the cab flew madly off down regent street
holmes looked eagerly round for another but no empty one was in sight
then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start was too great and already the cab was out of sight
there now said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles
was ever such bad luck and such bad management too
watson watson if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes  who was the man  i have not an idea  a spy  well it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town
how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen
if they had followed him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the second
you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the window while dr mortimer was reading his legend  yes i remember  i was looking out for loiterers in the street but i saw none
we are dealing with a clever man watson
this matter cuts very deep and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us i am conscious always of power and design
when our friends left i at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant
so wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice
his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them
it has however one obvious disadvantage  it puts him in the power of the cabman  exactly  what a pity we did not get the number  my dear watson clumsy as i have been you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number
no
 is our man
but that is no use to us for the moment  i fail to see how you could have done more  on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction
i should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there
when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for
as it is by an indiscreet eagerness which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man  we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation and dr mortimer with his companion had long vanished in front of us
there is no object in our following them said holmes
the shadow has departed and will not return
we must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision
could you swear to that mans face within the cab  i could swear only to the beard  and so could ifrom which i gather that in all probability it was a false one
a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features
come in here watson  he turned into one of the district messenger offices where he was warmly greeted by the manager
ah wilson i see you have not forgotten the little case in which i had the good fortune to help you  no sir indeed i have not
you saved my good name and perhaps my life  my dear fellow you exaggerate
i have some recollection wilson that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright who showed some ability during the investigation  yes sir he is still with us  could you ring him upthank you
and i should be glad to have change of this fivepound note  a lad of fourteen with a bright keen face had obeyed the summons of the manager
he stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective
let me have the hotel directory said holmes
thank you
now cartwright there are the names of twentythree hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross
do you see  yes sir  you will visit each of these in turn  yes sir  you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling
here are twentythree shillings  yes sir  you will tell him that you want to see the wastepaper of yesterday
you will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it
you understand  yes sir  but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the times with some holes cut in it with scissors
here is a copy of the times
it is this page
you could easily recognize it could you not  yes sir  in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give a shilling
here are twentythree shillings
you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twentythree that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed
in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the times among it
the odds are enormously against your finding it
there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies
let me have a report by wire at baker street before evening
and now watson it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no
 and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel     chapter 
three broken threads    sherlock holmes had in a very remarkable degree the power of detaching his mind at will
for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters
he would talk of nothing but art of which he had the crudest ideas from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel
sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you said the clerk
he asked me to show you up at once when you came  have you any objection to my looking at your register said holmes
not in the least  the book showed that two names had been added after that of baskerville
one was theophilus johnson and family of newcastle the other mrs oldmore and maid of high lodge alton
surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know said holmes to the porter
a lawyer is he not grayheaded and walks with a limp  no sir this is mr johnson the coalowner a very active gentleman not older than yourself  surely you are mistaken about his trade  no sir
he has used this hotel for many years and he is very well known to us  ah that settles it
mrs oldmore too i seem to remember the name
excuse my curiosity but often in calling upon one friend one finds another  she is an invalid lady sir
her husband was once mayor of gloucester
she always comes to us when she is in town  thank you i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance
we have established a most important fact by these questions watson he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together
we know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel
that means that while they are as we have seen very anxious to watch him they are equally anxious that he should not see them
now this is a most suggestive fact  what does it suggest  it suggestshalloa my dear fellow what on earth is the matter  as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir henry baskerville himself
his face was flushed with anger and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands
so furious was he that he was hardly articulate and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning
seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel he cried
theyll find theyve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful
by thunder if that chap cant find my missing boot there will be trouble
i can take a joke with the best mr holmes but theyve got a bit over the mark this time  still looking for your boot  yes sir and mean to find it  but surely you said that it was a new brown boot  so it was sir
and now its an old black one  what
you dont mean to say  thats just what i do mean to say
i only had three pairs in the worldthe new brown the old black and the patent leathers which i am wearing
last night they took one of my brown ones and today they have sneaked one of the black
well have you got it
speak out man and dont stand staring  an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene
no sir i have made inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it  well either that boot comes back before sundown or ill see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel  it shall be found siri promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found  mind it is for its the last thing of mine that ill lose in this den of thieves
well well mr holmes youll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle  i think its well worth troubling about  why you look very serious over it  how do you explain it  i just dont attempt to explain it
it seems the very maddest queerest thing that ever happened to me  the queerest perhaps said holmes thoughtfully
what do you make of it yourself  well i dont profess to understand it yet
this case of yours is very complex sir henry
when taken in conjunction with your uncles death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts so deep
but we hold several threads in our hands and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth
we may waste time in following the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right  we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together
it was in the private sittingroom to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked baskerville what were his intentions
to go to baskerville hall  and when  at the end of the week  on the whole said holmes i think that your decision is a wise one
i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be
if their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it
you did not know dr mortimer that you were followed this morning from my house  dr mortimer started violently
followed
by whom  that unfortunately is what i cannot tell you
have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a black full beard  noor let me seewhy yes
barrymore sir charless butler is a man with a full black beard  ha
where is barrymore  he is in charge of the hall  we had best ascertain if he is really there or if by any possibility he might be in london  how can you do that  give me a telegraph form
is all ready for sir henry that will do
address to mr barrymore baskerville hall
what is the nearest telegraphoffice
grimpen
very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr barrymore to be delivered into his own hand
if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not  thats so said baskerville
by the way dr mortimer who is this barrymore anyhow  he is the son of the old caretaker who is dead
they have looked after the hall for four generations now
so far as i know he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county  at the same time said baskerville its clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do  that is true  did barrymore profit at all by sir charless will asked holmes
he and his wife had five hundred pounds each  ha
did they know that they would receive this  yes sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will  that is very interesting  i hope said dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir charles for i also had a thousand pounds left to me  indeed
and anyone else  there were many insignificant sums to individuals and a large number of public charities
the residue all went to sir henry  and how much was the residue  seven hundred and forty thousand pounds  holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise
i had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved said he
sir charles had the reputation of being rich but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities
the total value of the estate was close on to a million  dear me
it is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game
and one more question dr mortimer
supposing that anything happened to our young friend hereyou will forgive the unpleasant hypothesiswho would inherit the estate  since rodger baskerville sir charless younger brother died unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who are distant cousins
james desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmoreland  thank you
these details are all of great interest
have you met mr james desmond  yes he once came down to visit sir charles
he is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life
i remember that he refused to accept any settlement from sir charles though he pressed it upon him  and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charless thousands  he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed
he would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he likes with it  and have you made your will sir henry  no mr holmes i have not
ive had no time for it was only yesterday that i learned how matters stood
but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate
that was my poor uncles idea
how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property
house land and dollars must go together  quite so
well sir henry i am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay
there is only one provision which i must make
you certainly must not go alone  dr
mortimer returns with me  but dr mortimer has his practice to attend to and his house is miles away from yours
with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you
no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be always by your side  is it possible that you could come yourself mr holmes  if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time
at the present instant one of the most revered names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal
you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor  whom would you recommend then  holmes laid his hand upon my arm
if my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place
no one can say so more confidently than i  the proposition took me completely by surprise but before i had time to answer baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily
well now that is real kind of you dr watson said he
you see how it is with me and you know just as much about the matter as i do
if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through ill never forget it  the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me and i was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion
i will come with pleasure said i
i do not know how i could employ my time better  and you will report very carefully to me said holmes
when a crisis comes as it will do i will direct how you shall act
i suppose that by saturday all might be ready  would that suit dr watson  perfectly  then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the tenthirty train from paddington  we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry of triumph and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet
my missing boot he cried
may all our difficulties vanish as easily said sherlock holmes
but it is a very singular thing dr mortimer remarked
i searched this room carefully before lunch  and so did i said baskerville
every inch of it  there was certainly no boot in it then  in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching  the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up
another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly
setting aside the whole grim story of sir charless death we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days which included the receipt of the printed letter the blackbearded spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot
holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to baker street and i knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind like my own was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted
all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought
just before dinner two telegrams were handed in
the first ran  have just heard that barrymore is at the hall
baskerville
the second  visited twentythree hotels as directed but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of times
cartwright
there go two of my threads watson
there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you
we must cast round for another scent  we have still the cabman who drove the spy  exactly
i have wired to get his name and address from the official registry
i should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question  the ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer however for the door opened and a roughlooking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself
i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for no
 said he
ive driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint
i came here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had against me  i have nothing in the world against you my good man said holmes
on the contrary i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions  well ive had a good day and no mistake said the cabman with a grin
what was it you wanted to ask sir  first of all your name and address in case i want you again  john clayton  turpey street the borough
my cab is out of shipleys yard near waterloo station  sherlock holmes made a note of it
now clayton tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten oclock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down regent street  the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed
why theres no good my telling you things for you seem to know as much as i do already  said he
the truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him to anyone  my good fellow this is a very serious business and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me
you say that your fare told you that he was a detective  yes he did  when did he say this  when he left me  did he say anything more  he mentioned his name  holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me
oh he mentioned his name did he
that was imprudent
what was the name that he mentioned  his name said the cabman was mr sherlock holmes  never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabmans reply
for an instant he sat in silent amazement
then he burst into a hearty laugh
a touch watsonan undeniable touch said he
i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own
he got home upon me very prettily that time
so his name was sherlock holmes was it  yes sir that was the gentlemans name  excellent
tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred  he hailed me at halfpast nine in trafalgar square
he said that he was a detective and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions
i was glad enough to agree
first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank
we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here  this very door said holmes
well i couldnt be sure of that but i dare say my fare knew all about it
we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half
then the two gentlemen passed us walking and we followed down baker street and along  i know said holmes
until we got threequarters down regent street
then my gentleman threw up the trap and he cried that i should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go
i whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes
then he paid up his two guineas like a good one and away he went into the station
only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr sherlock holmes thats how i come to know the name  i see
and you saw no more of him  not after he went into the station  and how would you describe mr sherlock holmes  the cabman scratched his head
well he wasnt altogether such an easy gentleman to describe
id put him at forty years of age and he was of a middle height two or three inches shorter than you sir
he was dressed like a toff and he had a black beard cut square at the end and a pale face
i dont know as i could say more than that  colour of his eyes  no i cant say that  nothing more that you can remember  no sir nothing  well then here is your halfsovereign
theres another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information
goodnight  goodnight sir and thank you  john clayton departed chuckling and holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile
snap goes our third thread and we end where we began said he
the cunning rascal
he knew our number knew that sir henry baskerville had consulted me spotted who i was in regent street conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver and so sent back this audacious message
i tell you watson this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel
ive been checkmated in london
i can only wish you better luck in devonshire
but im not easy in my mind about it  about what  about sending you
its an ugly business watson an ugly dangerous business and the more i see of it the less i like it
yes my dear fellow you may laugh but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more     chapter 
baskerville hall    sir henry baskerville and dr mortimer were ready upon the appointed day and we started as arranged for devonshire
mr sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice
i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions watson said he i wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorizing  what sort of facts i asked
anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case and especially the relations between young baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of sir charles
i have made some inquiries myself in the last few days but the results have i fear been negative
one thing only appears to be certain and that is that mr james desmond who is the next heir is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution does not arise from him
i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations
there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor  would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore couple  by no means
you could not make a greater mistake
if they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them
no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspects
then there is a groom at the hall if i remember right
there are two moorland farmers
there is our friend dr mortimer whom i believe to be entirely honest and there is his wife of whom we know nothing
there is this naturalist stapleton and there is his sister who is said to be a young lady of attractions
there is mr frankland of lafter hall who is also an unknown factor and there are one or two other neighbours
these are the folk who must be your very special study  i will do my best  you have arms i suppose  yes i thought it as well to take them  most certainly
keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions  our friends had already secured a firstclass carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform
no we have no news of any kind said dr mortimer in answer to my friends questions
i can swear to one thing and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days
we have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch and no one could have escaped our notice  you have always kept together i presume  except yesterday afternoon
i usually give up one day to pure amusement when i come to town so i spent it at the museum of the college of surgeons  and i went to look at the folk in the park said baskerville
but we had no trouble of any kind  it was imprudent all the same said holmes shaking his head and looking very grave
i beg sir henry that you will not go about alone
some great misfortune will befall you if you do
did you get your other boot  no sir it is gone forever  indeed
that is very interesting
well goodbye he added as the train began to glide down the platform
bear in mind sir henry one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted  i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us
the journey was a swift and pleasant one and i spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with dr mortimers spaniel
in a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy the brick had changed to granite and red cows grazed in wellhedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer if a damper climate
young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the devon scenery
ive been over a good part of the world since i left it dr watson  said he but i have never seen a place to compare with it  i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county i remarked
it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county said dr mortimer
a glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the celt which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment
poor sir charless head was of a very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics
but you were very young when you last saw baskerville hall were you not  i was a boy in my teens at the time of my fathers death and had never seen the hall for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast
thence i went straight to a friend in america
i tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr watson and im as keen as possible to see the moor  are you
then your wish is easily granted for there is your first sight of the moor said dr mortimer pointing out of the carriage window
over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray melancholy hill with a strange jagged summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in a dream
baskerville sat for a long time his eyes fixed upon it and i read upon his eager face how much it meant to him this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep
there he sat with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of a prosaic railwaycarriage and yet as i looked at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of highblooded fiery and masterful men
there were pride valour and strength in his thick brows his sensitive nostrils and his large hazel eyes
if on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it
the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended
outside beyond the low white fence a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting
our coming was evidently a great event for stationmaster and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage
it was a sweet simple country spot but i was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed
the coachman a hardfaced gnarled little fellow saluted sir henry baskerville and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad white road
rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever dark against the evening sky the long gloomy curve of the moor broken by the jagged and sinister hills
the wagonette swung round into a side road and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels high banks on either side heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hartstongue ferns
bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun
still steadily rising we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders
both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir
at every turn baskerville gave an exclamation of delight looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions
to his eyes all seemed beautiful but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year
yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed
the rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetationsad gifts as it seemed to me for nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles
halloa cried dr mortimer what is this  a steep curve of heathclad land an outlying spur of the moor lay in front of us
on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal was a mounted soldier dark and stern his rifle poised ready over his forearm
he was watching the road along which we travelled
what is this perkins asked dr mortimer
our driver half turned in his seat
theres a convict escaped from princetown sir
hes been out three days now and the warders watch every road and every station but theyve had no sight of him yet
the farmers about here dont like it sir and thats a fact  well i understand that they get five pounds if they can give information  yes sir but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut
you see it isnt like any ordinary convict
this is a man that would stick at nothing  who is he then  it is selden the notting hill murderer  i remembered the case well for it was one in which holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin
the commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity so atrocious was his conduct
our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor mottled with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors
a cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering
somewhere there on that desolate plain was lurking this fiendish man hiding in a burrow like a wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out
it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste the chilling wind and the darkling sky
even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him
we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us
we looked back on it now the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands
the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes sprinkled with giant boulders
now and then we passed a moorland cottage walled and roofed with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline
suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm
two high narrow towers rose over the trees
the driver pointed with his whip
baskerville hall said he
its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes
a few minutes later we had reached the lodgegates a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron with weatherbitten pillars on either side blotched with lichens and surmounted by the boars heads of the baskervilles
the lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters but facing it was a new building half constructed the first fruit of sir charless south african gold
through the gateway we passed into the avenue where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads
baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end
was it here he asked in a low voice
no no the yew alley is on the other side  the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face
its no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this said he
its enough to scare any man
ill have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you wont know it again with a thousand candlepower swan and edison right here in front of the hall door  the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf and the house lay before us
in the fading light i could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected
the whole front was draped in ivy with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil
from this central block rose the twin towers ancient crenelated and pierced with many loopholes
to right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite
a dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep highangled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke
welcome sir henry
welcome to baskerville hall  a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette
the figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall
she came out and helped the man to hand down our bags
you dont mind my driving straight home sir henry said dr mortimer
my wife is expecting me  surely you will stay and have some dinner  no i must go
i shall probably find some work awaiting me
i would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be a better guide than i goodbye and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service  the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned into the hall and the door clanged heavily behind us
it was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves large lofty and heavily raftered with huge baulks of ageblackened oak
in the great oldfashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a logfire crackled and snapped
sir henry and i held out our hands to it for we were numb from our long drive
then we gazed round us at the high thin window of old stained glass the oak panelling the stags heads the coats of arms upon the walls all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp
its just as i imagined it said sir henry
is it not the very picture of an old family home
to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived
it strikes me solemn to think of it  i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him
the light beat upon him where he stood but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him
barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms
he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a welltrained servant
he was a remarkablelooking man tall handsome with a square black beard and pale distinguished features
would you wish dinner to be served at once sir  is it ready  in a very few minutes sir
you will find hot water in your rooms
my wife and i will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff  what new conditions  i only meant sir that sir charles led a very retired life and we were able to look after his wants
you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need changes in your household  do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave  only when it is quite convenient to you sir  but your family have been with us for several generations have they not
i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection  i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butlers white face
i feel that also sir and so does my wife
but to tell the truth sir we were both very much attached to sir charles and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us
i fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at baskerville hall  but what do you intend to do  i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business
sir charless generosity has given us the means to do so
and now sir perhaps i had best show you to your rooms  a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall approached by a double stair
from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building from which all the bedrooms opened
my own was in the same wing as baskervilles and almost next door to it
these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind
but the diningroom which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and gloom
it was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents
at one end a minstrels gallery overlooked it
black beams shot across above our heads with a smokedarkened ceiling beyond them
with rows of flaring torches to light it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an oldtime banquet it might have softened but now when two blackclothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp ones voice became hushed and ones spirit subdued
a dim line of ancestors in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company
we talked little and i for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiardroom and smoke a cigarette
my word it isnt a very cheerful place said sir henry
i suppose one can tone down to it but i feel a bit out of the picture at present
i dont wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this
however if it suits you we will retire early tonight and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning  i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window
it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door
beyond two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind
a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds
in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks and the long low curve of the melancholy moor
i closed the curtain feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest
and yet it was not quite the last
i found myself weary and yet wakeful tossing restlessly from side to side seeking for the sleep which would not come
far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house
and then suddenly in the very dead of the night there came a sound to my ears clear resonant and unmistakable
it was the sob of a woman the muffled strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow
i sat up in bed and listened intently
the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house
for half an hour i waited with every nerve on the alert but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall
chapter 
the stapletons of merripit house    the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall
as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them
the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before
i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame said the baronet
we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive so we took a gray view of the place
now we are fresh and well so it is all cheerful once more  and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination i answered
did you for example happen to hear someone a woman i think sobbing in the night  that is curious for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i heard something of the sort
i waited quite a time but there was no more of it so i concluded that it was all a dream  i heard it distinctly and i am sure that it was really the sob of a woman  we must ask about this right away he rang the bell and asked barrymore whether he could account for our experience
it seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his masters question
there are only two women in the house sir henry he answered
one is the scullerymaid who sleeps in the other wing
the other is my wife and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her  and yet he lied as he said it for it chanced that after breakfast i met mrs barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face
she was a large impassive heavyfeatured woman with a stern set expression of mouth
but her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids
it was she then who wept in the night and if she did so her husband must know it
yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so
why had he done this
and why did she weep so bitterly
already round this palefaced handsome blackbearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom
it was he who had been the first to discover the body of sir charles and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old mans death
was it possible that it was barrymore after all whom we had seen in the cab in regent street
the beard might well have been the same
the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man but such an impression might easily have been erroneous
how could i settle the point forever
obviously the first thing to do was to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in barrymores own hands
be the answer what it might i should at least have something to report to sherlock holmes
sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast so that the time was propitious for my excursion
it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor leading me at last to a small gray hamlet in which two larger buildings which proved to be the inn and the house of dr mortimer stood high above the rest
the postmaster who was also the village grocer had a clear recollection of the telegram
certainly sir said he i had the telegram delivered to mr barrymore exactly as directed  who delivered it  my boy here
james you delivered that telegram to mr barrymore at the hall last week did you not  yes father i delivered it  into his own hands i asked
well he was up in the loft at the time so that i could not put it into his own hands but i gave it into mrs barrymores hands and she promised to deliver it at once  did you see mr barrymore  no sir i tell you he was in the loft  if you didnt see him how do you know he was in the loft  well surely his own wife ought to know where he is said the postmaster testily
didnt he get the telegram
if there is any mistake it is for mr barrymore himself to complain  it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther but it was clear that in spite of holmess ruse we had no proof that barrymore had not been in london all the time
suppose that it were sosuppose that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charles alive and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to england
what then
was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own
what interest could he have in persecuting the baskerville family
i thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the times
was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes
the only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by sir henry that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the barrymores
but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet
holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations
i prayed as i walked back along the gray lonely road that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders
suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name
i turned expecting to see dr mortimer but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me
he was a small slim cleanshaven primfaced man flaxenhaired and leanjawed between thirty and forty years of age dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw hat
a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterflynet in one of his hands
you will i am sure excuse my presumption dr watson said he as he came panting up to where i stood
here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions
you may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend mortimer
i am stapleton of merripit house  your net and box would have told me as much said i for i knew that mr stapleton was a naturalist
but how did you know me  i have been calling on mortimer and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed
as our road lay the same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself
i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his journey  he is very well thank you  we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here
it is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind but i need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside
sir henry has i suppose no superstitious fears in the matter  i do not think that it is likely  of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family  i have heard it  it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here
any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor he spoke with a smile but i seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously
the story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end  but how  his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart
i fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley
i feared that some disaster might occur for i was very fond of the old man and i knew that his heart was weak  how did you know that  my friend mortimer told me  you think then that some dog pursued sir charles and that he died of fright in consequence  have you any better explanation  i have not come to any conclusion  has mr sherlock holmes  the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended
it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr watson  said he
the records of your detective have reached us here and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself
when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity
if you are here then it follows that mr sherlock holmes is interesting himself in the matter and i am naturally curious to know what view he may take  i am afraid that i cannot answer that question  may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself  he cannot leave town at present
he has other cases which engage his attention  what a pity
he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us
but as to your own researches if there is any possible way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will command me
if i had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice  i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend sir henry and that i need no help of any kind  excellent said stapleton
you are perfectly right to be wary and discreet
i am justly reproved for what i feel was an unjustifiable intrusion and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again  we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor
a steep bouldersprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry
the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff with ferns and brambles growing in its niches
from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke
a moderate walk along this moorpath brings us to merripit house  said he
perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister  my first thought was that i should be by sir henrys side
but then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered
it was certain that i could not help with those
and holmes had expressly said that i should study the neighbours upon the moor
i accepted stapletons invitation and we turned together down the path
it is a wonderful place the moor said he looking round over the undulating downs long green rollers with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges
you never tire of the moor
you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains
it is so vast and so barren and so mysterious  you know it well then  i have only been here two years
the residents would call me a newcomer
we came shortly after sir charles settled
but my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round and i should think that there are few men who know it better than i do  is it hard to know  very hard
you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it
do you observe anything remarkable about that  it would be a rare place for a gallop  you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now
you notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it  yes they seem more fertile than the rest  stapleton laughed
that is the great grimpen mire said he
a false step yonder means death to man or beast
only yesterday i saw one of the moor ponies wander into it
he never came out
i saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the boghole but it sucked him down at last
even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it but after these autumn rains it is an awful place
and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive
by george there is another of those miserable ponies  something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges
then a long agonized writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor
it turned me cold with horror but my companions nerves seemed to be stronger than mine
its gone said he
the mire has him
two in two days and many more perhaps for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches
its a bad place the great grimpen mire  and you say you can penetrate it  yes there are one or two paths which a very active man can take
i have found them out  but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place  well you see the hills beyond
they are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire which has crawled round them in the course of years
that is where the rare plants and the butterflies are if you have the wit to reach them  i shall try my luck some day  he looked at me with a surprised face
for gods sake put such an idea out of your mind said he
your blood would be upon my head
i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive
it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that i am able to do it  halloa i cried
what is that  a long low moan indescribably sad swept over the moor
it filled the whole air and yet it was impossible to say whence it came
from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar and then sank back into a melancholy throbbing murmur once again
stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face
queer place the moor said he
but what is it  the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for its prey
ive heard it once or twice before but never quite so loud  i looked round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge swelling plain mottled with the green patches of rushes
nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens which croaked loudly from a tor behind us
you are an educated man
you dont believe such nonsense as that said i
what do you think is the cause of so strange a sound  bogs make queer noises sometimes
its the mud settling or the water rising or something  no no that was a living voice  well perhaps it was
did you ever hear a bittern booming  no i never did  its a very rare birdpractically extinctin england now but all things are possible upon the moor
yes i should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns  its the weirdest strangest thing that ever i heard in my life  yes its rather an uncanny place altogether
look at the hillside yonder
what do you make of those  the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone a score of them at least
what are they
sheeppens  no they are the homes of our worthy ancestors
prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor and as no one in particular has lived there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them
these are his wigwams with the roofs off
you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside
but it is quite a town
when was it inhabited  neolithic manno date  what did he do  he grazed his cattle on these slopes and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe
look at the great trench in the opposite hill
that is his mark
yes you will find some very singular points about the moor dr watson
oh excuse me an instant
it is surely cyclopides  a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it
to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never paused for an instant bounding from tuft to tuft behind it his green net waving in the air
his gray clothes and jerky zigzag irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself
i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when i heard the sound of steps and turning round found a woman near me upon the path
she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close
i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had been told since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a beauty
the woman who approached me was certainly that and of a most uncommon type
there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister for stapleton was neutral tinted with light hair and gray eyes while she was darker than any brunette whom i have seen in englandslim elegant and tall
she had a proud finely cut face so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager eyes
with her perfect figure and elegant dress she was indeed a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path
her eyes were on her brother as i turned and then she quickened her pace towards me
i had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel
go back she said
go straight back to london instantly  i could only stare at her in stupid surprise
her eyes blazed at me and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot
why should i go back i asked
i cannot explain she spoke in a low eager voice with a curious lisp in her utterance
but for gods sake do what i ask you
go back and never set foot upon the moor again  but i have only just come  man man she cried
can you not tell when a warning is for your own good
go back to london
start tonight
get away from this place at all costs
hush my brother is coming
not a word of what i have said
would you mind getting that orchid for me among the marestails yonder
we are very rich in orchids on the moor though of course you are rather late to see the beauties of the place  stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions
halloa beryl said he and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one
well jack you are very hot  yes i was chasing a cyclopides
he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn
what a pity that i should have missed him he spoke unconcernedly but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me
you have introduced yourselves i can see  yes
i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor  why who do you think this is  i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville  no no said i
only a humble commoner but his friend
my name is dr watson  a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face
we have been talking at cross purposes said she
why you had not very much time for talk her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes
i talked as if dr watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor said she
it cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids
but you will come on will you not and see merripit house  a short walk brought us to it a bleak moorland house once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling
an orchard surrounded it but the trees as is usual upon the moor were stunted and nipped and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy
we were admitted by a strange wizened rustycoated old manservant who seemed in keeping with the house
inside however there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which i seemed to recognize the taste of the lady
as i looked from their windows at the interminable graniteflecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place
queer spot to choose is it not said he as if in answer to my thought
and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl  quite happy said she but there was no ring of conviction in her words
i had a school said stapleton
it was in the north country
the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of living with youth of helping to mould those young minds and of impressing them with ones own character and ideals was very dear to me
however the fates were against us
a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died
it never recovered from the blow and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up
and yet if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys i could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong tastes for botany and zoology i find an unlimited field of work here and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am
all this dr watson has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window  it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dullless for you perhaps than for your sister  no no i am never dull said she quickly
we have books we have our studies and we have interesting neighbours
dr mortimer is a most learned man in his own line
poor sir charles was also an admirable companion
we knew him well and miss him more than i can tell
do you think that i should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry  i am sure that he would be delighted  then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so
we may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings
will you come upstairs dr watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera
i think it is the most complete one in the southwest of england
by the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready  but i was eager to get back to my charge
the melancholy of the moor the death of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness
then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of miss stapleton delivered with such intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it
i resisted all pressure to stay for lunch and i set off at once upon my return journey taking the grassgrown path by which we had come
it seems however that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it for before i had reached the road i was astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track
her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side
i have run all the way in order to cut you off dr watson said she
i had not even time to put on my hat
i must not stop or my brother may miss me
i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir henry
please forget the words i said which have no application whatever to you  but i cant forget them miss stapleton said i
i am sir henrys friend and his welfare is a very close concern of mine
tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should return to london  a womans whim dr watson
when you know me better you will understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or do  no no
i remember the thrill in your voice
i remember the look in your eyes
please please be frank with me miss stapleton for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me
life has become like that great grimpen mire with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track
tell me then what it was that you meant and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry  an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me
you make too much of it dr watson said she
my brother and i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles
we knew him very intimately for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house
he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed
i was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here and i felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run
that was all which i intended to convey
but what is the danger  you know the story of the hound  i do not believe in such nonsense  but i do
if you have any influence with sir henry take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family
the world is wide
why should he wish to live at the place of danger  because it is the place of danger
that is sir henrys nature
i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move  i cannot say anything definite for i do not know anything definite  i would ask you one more question miss stapleton
if you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said
there is nothing to which he or anyone else could object  my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor
he would be very angry if he knew that i have said anything which might induce sir henry to go away
but i have done my duty now and i will say no more
i must go back or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you
goodbye  she turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders while i with my soul full of vague fears pursued my way to baskerville hall
chapter 
first report of dr watson    from this point onward i will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to mr sherlock holmes which lie before me on the table
one page is missing but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it is upon these tragic events can possibly do
baskerville hall october th
my dear holmes my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most godforsaken corner of the world
the longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into ones soul its vastness and also its grim charm
when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern england behind you but on the other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people
on all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples
as you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you and if you were to see a skinclad hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flinttipped arrow on to the string of his bow you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own
the strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil
i am no antiquarian but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy
all this however is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind
i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun
let me therefore return to the facts concerning sir henry baskerville
if you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate
then a very surprising circumstance occurred which i shall tell you in due course
but first of all i must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation
one of these concerning which i have said little is the escaped convict upon the moor
there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district
a fortnight has passed since his flight during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him
it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time
of course so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all
any one of these stone huts would give him a hidingplace
but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep
we think therefore that he has gone and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence
we are four ablebodied men in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but i confess that i have had uneasy moments when i have thought of the stapletons
they live miles from any help
there are one maid an old manservant the sister and the brother the latter not a very strong man
they would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance
both sir henry and i were concerned at their situation and it was suggested that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it
the fact is that our friend the baronet begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour
it is not to be wondered at for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman
there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother
yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires
he has certainly a very marked influence over her for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said
i trust that he is kind to her
there is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature
you would find him an interesting study
he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin
it was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story
we found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass
in the middle of it rose two great stones worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast
in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy
sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men
he spoke lightly but it was evident that he was very much in earnest
stapleton was guarded in his replies but it was easy to see that he said less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet
he told us of similar cases where families had suffered from some evil influence and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter
on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house and it was there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton
from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual
he referred to her again and again on our walk home and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister
they dine here tonight and there is some talk of our going to them next week
one would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton and yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some attention to his sister
he is much attached to her no doubt and would lead a lonely life without her but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage
yet i am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and i have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being teteatete
by the way your instructions to me never to allow sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties
my popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders to the letter
the other daythursday to be more exactdr mortimer lunched with us
he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy
never was there such a singleminded enthusiast as he
the stapletons came in afterwards and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henrys request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night
it is a long dismal walk the yew alley between two high walls of clipped hedge with a narrow band of grass upon either side
at the far end is an old tumbledown summerhouse
halfway down is the moorgate where the old gentleman left his cigarash
it is a white wooden gate with a latch
beyond it lies the wide moor
i remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred
as the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion
there was the long gloomy tunnel down which he fled
and from what
a sheepdog of the moor
or a spectral hound black silent and monstrous
was there a human agency in the matter
did the pale watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say
it was all dim and vague but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it
one other neighbour i have met since i wrote last
this is mr frankland of lafter hall who lives some four miles to the south of us
he is an elderly man redfaced whitehaired and choleric
his passion is for the british law and he has spent a large fortune in litigation
he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a question so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement
sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it
at others he will with his own hands tear down some other mans gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass
he is learned in old manorial and communal rights and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy according to his latest exploit
he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future
apart from the law he seems a kindly goodnatured person and i only mention him because you were particular that i should send some description of the people who surround us
he is curiously employed at present for being an amateur astronomer he has an excellent telescope with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict
if he would confine his energies to this all would be well but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down
he helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed
and now having brought you up to date in the escaped convict the stapletons dr mortimer and frankland of lafter hall let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprising development of last night
first of all about the test telegram which you sent from london in order to make sure that barrymore was really here
i have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other
i told sir henry how the matter stood and he at once in his downright fashion had barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself
barrymore said that he had
did the boy deliver it into your own hands asked sir henry
barrymore looked surprised and considered for a little time
no said he i was in the boxroom at the time and my wife brought it up to me  did you answer it yourself  no i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it  in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord
i could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning sir henry said he
i trust that they do not mean that i have done anything to forfeit your confidence  sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit having now all arrived
mrs barrymore is of interest to me
she is a heavy solid person very limited intensely respectable and inclined to be puritanical
you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject
yet i have told you how on the first night here i heard her sobbing bitterly and since then i have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face
some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart
sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of being a domestic tyrant
i have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this mans character but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head
and yet it may seem a small matter in itself
you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever
last night about two in the morning i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room
i rose opened my door and peeped out
a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor
it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand
he was in shirt and trousers with no covering to his feet
i could merely see the outline but his height told me that it was barrymore
he walked very slowly and circumspectly and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance
i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall but that it is resumed upon the farther side
i waited until he had passed out of sight and then i followed him
when i came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms
now all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever
the light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless
i crept down the passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of the door
barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass
his profile was half turned towards me and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor
for some minutes he stood watching intently
then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light
instantly i made my way back to my room and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey
long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound came
what it all means i cannot guess but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of
i do not trouble you with my theories for you asked me to furnish you only with facts
i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night
i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interesting reading
chapter 
the light upon the moor second report of dr watson    baskerville hall oct th
my dear holmes if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up for lost time and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us
in my last report i ended upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i am much mistaken considerably surprise you
things have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated
in some ways they have within the last fortyeight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated
but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself
before breakfast on the morning following my adventure i went down the corridor and examined the room in which barrymore had been on the night before
the western window through which he had stared so intently has i noticed one peculiarity above all other windows in the houseit commands the nearest outlook on to the moor
there is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained
it follows therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor
the night was very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone
it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot
that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife
the man is a strikinglooking fellow very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seemed to have something to support it
that opening of the door which i had heard after i had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment
so i reasoned with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicions however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded
but whatever the true explanation of barrymores movements might be i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until i could explain them was more than i could bear
i had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i told him all that i had seen
he was less surprised than i had expected
i knew that barrymore walked about nights and i had a mind to speak to him about it said he
two or three times i have heard his steps in the passage coming and going just about the hour you name  perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window i suggested
perhaps he does
if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after
i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he were here  i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest said i
he would follow barrymore and see what he did  then we shall do it together  but surely he would hear us  the man is rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that
well sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor
the baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon
there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family
when the house is renovated and refurnished all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete
between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton
and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect
today for example its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance
after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepared to go out
as a matter of course i did the same
what are you coming watson he asked looking at me in a curious way
that depends on whether you are going on the moor said i
yes i am  well you know what my instructions are
i am sorry to intrude but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor  sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile
my dear fellow said he holmes with all his wisdom did not foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the moor
you understand me
i am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoilsport
i must go out alone  it put me in a most awkward position
i was at a loss what to say or what to do and before i had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone
but when i came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight
i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions
i assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought
it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of merripit house
i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of sir henry until i came to the point where the moor path branches off
there fearing that perhaps i had come in the wrong direction after all i mounted a hill from which i could command a viewthe same hill which is cut into the dark quarry
thence i saw him at once
he was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady was by his side who could only be miss stapleton
it was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment
they were walking slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying while he listened intently and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent
i stood among the rocks watching them very much puzzled as to what i should do next
to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight
to act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task
still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what i had done
it is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use and yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult and that there was nothing more which i could do
our friend sir henry and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation when i was suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their interview
a wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground
it was stapleton with his butterflynet
he was very much closer to the pair than i was and he appeared to be moving in their direction
at this instant sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side
his arm was round her but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted
he stooped his head to hers and she raised one hand as if in protest
next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round
stapleton was the cause of the interruption
he was running wildly towards them his absurd net dangling behind him
he gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers
what the scene meant i could not imagine but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir henry who offered explanations which became more angry as the other refused to accept them
the lady stood by in haughty silence
finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walked off by the side of her brother
the naturalists angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure
the baronet stood for a minute looking after them and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come his head hanging the very picture of dejection
what all this meant i could not imagine but i was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friends knowledge
i ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom
his face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled like one who is at his wits ends what to do
halloa watson
where have you dropped from said he
you dont mean to say that you came after me in spite of all  i explained everything to him how i had found it impossible to remain behind how i had followed him and how i had witnessed all that had occurred
for an instant his eyes blazed at me but my frankness disarmed his anger and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh
you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private said he but by thunder the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooingand a mighty poor wooing at that
where had you engaged a seat  i was on that hill  quite in the back row eh
but her brother was well up to the front
did you see him come out on us  yes i did  did he ever strike you as being crazythis brother of hers  i cant say that he ever did  i dare say not
i always thought him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket
whats the matter with me anyhow
youve lived near me for some weeks watson
tell me straight now
is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that i loved  i should say not  he cant object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he has this down on
what has he against me
i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of
and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers  did he say so  that and a deal more
i tell you watson ive only known her these few weeks but from the first i just felt that she was made for me and she tooshe was happy when she was with me and that ill swear
theres a light in a womans eyes that speaks louder than words
but he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few words with her alone
she was glad to meet me but when she did it was not love that she would talk about and she wouldnt have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it
she kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i had left it
i told her that since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it and that if she really wanted me to go the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me
with that i offered in as many words to marry her but before she could answer down came this brother of hers running at us with a face on him like a madman
he was just white with rage and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury
what was i doing with the lady
how dared i offer her attentions which were distasteful to her
did i think that because i was a baronet i could do what i liked
if he had not been her brother i should have known better how to answer him
as it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as i was not ashamed of and that i hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife
that seemed to make the matter no better so then i lost my temper too and i answered him rather more hotly than i should perhaps considering that she was standing by
so it ended by his going off with her as you saw and here am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county
just tell me what it all means watson and ill owe you more than ever i can hope to pay  i tried one or two explanations but indeed i was completely puzzled myself
our friends title his fortune his age his character and his appearance are all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family
that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the ladys own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing
however our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon
he had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed and that we are to dine at merripit house next friday as a sign of it
i dont say now that he isnt a crazy man said sir henry i cant forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done  did he give any explanation of his conduct  his sister is everything in his life he says
that is natural enough and i am glad that he should understand her value
they have always been together and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him
he had not understood he said that i was becoming attached to her but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so and that she might be taken away from him it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did
he was very sorry for all that had passed and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life
if she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else
but in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it
he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the ladys friendship during that time without claiming her love
this i promised and so the matter rests  so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up
it is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering
we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sisters suitoreven when that suitor was so eligible a one as sir henry
and now i pass on to another thread which i have extricated out of the tangled skein the mystery of the sobs in the night of the tearstained face of mrs barrymore of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window
congratulate me my dear holmes and tell me that i have not disappointed you as an agentthat you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down
all these things have by one nights work been thoroughly cleared
i have said by one nights work but in truth it was by two nights work for on the first we drew entirely blank
i sat up with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three oclock in the morning but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs
it was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs
fortunately we were not discouraged and we determined to try again
the next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound
it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander
one struck and two and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more
we had heard the creak of a step in the passage
very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance
then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit
already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness
softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing
we were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall blackbearded figure his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage
then he passed through the same door as before and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor
we shuffled cautiously towards it trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it
we had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us but even so the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread
sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach
however the man is fortunately rather deaf and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing
when at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window candle in hand his white intent face pressed against the pane exactly as i had seen him two nights before
we had arranged no plan of campaign but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural
he walked into the room and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood livid and trembling before us
his dark eyes glaring out of the white mask of his face were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me
what are you doing here barrymore  nothing sir his agitation was so great that he could hardly speak and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle
it was the window sir
i go round at night to see that they are fastened  on the second floor  yes sir all the windows  look here barrymore said sir henry sternly we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later
come now
no lies
what were you doing at that window  the fellow looked at us in a helpless way and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery
i was doing no harm sir
i was holding a candle to the window  and why were you holding a candle to the window  dont ask me sir henrydont ask me
i give you my word sir that it is not my secret and that i cannot tell it
if it concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you  a sudden idea occurred to me and i took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler
he must have been holding it as a signal said i
let us see if there is any answer i held it as he had done and stared out into the darkness of the night
vaguely i could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor for the moon was behind the clouds
and then i gave a cry of exultation for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window
there it is i cried
no no sir it is nothingnothing at all the butler broke in i assure you sir  move your light across the window watson cried the baronet
see the other moves also
now you rascal do you deny that it is a signal
come speak up
who is your confederate out yonder and what is this conspiracy that is going on  the mans face became openly defiant
it is my business and not yours
i will not tell  then you leave my employment right away  very good sir
if i must i must  and you go in disgrace
by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself
your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me  no no sir no not against you it was a womans voice and mrs barrymore paler and more horrorstruck than her husband was standing at the door
her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face
we have to go eliza
this is the end of it
you can pack our things  said the butler
oh john john have i brought you to this
it is my doing sir henryall mine
he has done nothing except for my sake and because i asked him  speak out then
what does it mean  my unhappy brother is starving on the moor
we cannot let him perish at our very gates
the light is a signal to him that food is ready for him and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it  then your brother is  the escaped convict sirselden the criminal  thats the truth sir said barrymore
i said that it was not my secret and that i could not tell it to you
but now you have heard it and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you  this then was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window
sir henry and i both stared at the woman in amazement
was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country
yes sir my name was selden and he is my younger brother
we humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure and that he could do what he liked in it
then as he grew older he met wicked companions and the devil entered into him until he broke my mothers heart and dragged our name in the dirt
from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold but to me sir he was always the little curlyheaded boy that i had nursed and played with as an elder sister would
that was why he broke prison sir
he knew that i was here and that we could not refuse to help him
when he dragged himself here one night weary and starving with the warders hard at his heels what could we do
we took him in and fed him and cared for him
then you returned sir and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over so he lay in hiding there
but every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him
every day we hoped that he was gone but as long as he was there we could not desert him
that is the whole truth as i am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he has done all that he has  the womans words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them
is this true barrymore  yes sir henry
every word of it  well i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife
forget what i have said
go to your room you two and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning  when they were gone we looked out of the window again
sir henry had flung it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces
far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light
i wonder he dares said sir henry
it may be so placed as to be only visible from here  very likely
how far do you think it is  out by the cleft tor i think  not more than a mile or two off  hardly that  well it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to it
and he is waiting this villain beside that candle
by thunder watson i am going out to take that man  the same thought had crossed my own mind
it was not as if the barrymores had taken us into their confidence
their secret had been forced from them
the man was a danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse
we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm
with his brutal and violent nature others would have to pay the price if we held our hands
any night for example our neighbours the stapletons might be attacked by him and it may have been the thought of this which made sir henry so keen upon the adventure
i will come said i
then get your revolver and put on your boots
the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his light and be off  in five minutes we were outside the door starting upon our expedition
we hurried through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves
the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay
now and again the moon peeped out for an instant but clouds were driving over the face of the sky and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall
the light still burned steadily in front
are you armed i asked
i have a huntingcrop  we must close in on him rapidly for he is said to be a desperate fellow
we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist  i say watson said the baronet what would holmes say to this
how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted  as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire
it came with the wind through the silence of the night a long deep mutter then a rising howl and then the sad moan in which it died away
again and again it sounded the whole air throbbing with it strident wild and menacing
the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness
my god whats that watson  i dont know
its a sound they have on the moor
i heard it once before  it died away and an absolute silence closed in upon us
we stood straining our ears but nothing came
watson said the baronet it was the cry of a hound  my blood ran cold in my veins for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him
what do they call this sound he asked
who  the folk on the countryside  oh they are ignorant people
why should you mind what they call it  tell me watson
what do they say of it  i hesitated but could not escape the question
they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles  he groaned and was silent for a few moments
a hound it was he said at last but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder i think  it was hard to say whence it came  it rose and fell with the wind
isnt that the direction of the great grimpen mire  yes it is  well it was up there
come now watson didnt you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound
i am not a child
you need not fear to speak the truth  stapleton was with me when i heard it last
he said that it might be the calling of a strange bird  no no it was a hound
my god can there be some truth in all these stories
is it possible that i am really in danger from so dark a cause
you dont believe it do you watson  no no  and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that
and my uncle
there was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay
it all fits together
i dont think that i am a coward watson but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood
feel my hand  it was as cold as a block of marble
youll be all right tomorrow  i dont think ill get that cry out of my head
what do you advise that we do now  shall we turn back  no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it
we after the convict and a hellhound as likely as not after us
come on
well see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor  we stumbled slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hills around us and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front
there is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitchdark night and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us
but at last we could see whence it came and then we knew that we were indeed very close
a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible save in the direction of baskerville hall
a boulder of granite concealed our approach and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light
it was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor with no sign of life near itjust the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it
what shall we do now whispered sir henry
wait here
he must be near his light
let us see if we can get a glimpse of him  the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him
over the rocks in the crevice of which the candle burned there was thrust out an evil yellow face a terrible animal face all seamed and scored with vile passions
foul with mire with a bristling beard and hung with matted hair it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides
the light beneath him was reflected in his small cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters
something had evidently aroused his suspicions
it may have been that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well but i could read his fears upon his wicked face
any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness
i sprang forward therefore and sir henry did the same
at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us
i caught one glimpse of his short squat strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run
at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds
we rushed over the brow of the hill and there was our man running with great speed down the other side springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat
a lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him but i had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away
we were both swift runners and in fairly good training but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him
we saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill
we ran and ran until we were completely blown but the space between us grew ever wider
finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks while we watched him disappearing in the distance
and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected thing
we had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home having abandoned the hopeless chase
the moon was low upon the right and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc
there outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background i saw the figure of a man upon the tor
do not think that it was a delusion holmes
i assure you that i have never in my life seen anything more clearly
as far as i could judge the figure was that of a tall thin man
he stood with his legs a little separated his arms folded his head bowed as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him
he might have been the very spirit of that terrible place
it was not the convict
this man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared
besides he was a much taller man
with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the baronet but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone
there was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure
i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor but it was some distance away
the baronets nerves were still quivering from that cry which recalled the dark story of his family and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures
he had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me
a warder no doubt said he
the moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped well perhaps his explanation may be the right one but i should like to have some further proof of it
today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their missing man but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner
such are the adventures of last night and you must acknowledge my dear holmes that i have done you very well in the matter of a report
much of what i tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant but still i feel that it is best that i should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions
we are certainly making some progress
so far as the barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions and that has cleared up the situation very much
but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever
perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon this also
best of all would it be if you could come down to us
in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days
chapter 
extract from the diary of dr watson    so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes
now however i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections aided by the diary which i kept at the time
a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory
i proceed then from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor
october th
a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain
the house is banked in with rolling clouds which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor with thin silver veins upon the sides of the hills and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces
it is melancholy outside and in
the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night
i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending dangerever present danger which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it
and have i not cause for such a feeling
consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us
there is the death of the last occupant of the hall fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor
twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant baying of a hound
it is incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature
a spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of
stapleton may fall in with such a superstition and mortimer also but if i have one quality upon earth it is common sense and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing
to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hellfire shooting from his mouth and eyes
holmes would not listen to such fancies and i am his agent
but facts are facts and i have twice heard this crying upon the moor
suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it that would go far to explain everything
but where could such a hound lie concealed where did it get its food where did it come from how was it that no one saw it by day
it must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other
and always apart from the hound there is the fact of the human agency in london the man in the cab and the letter which warned sir henry against the moor
this at least was real but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy
where is that friend or enemy now
has he remained in london or has he followed us down here
could hecould he be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor
it is true that i have had only the one glance at him and yet there are some things to which i am ready to swear
he is no one whom i have seen down here and i have now met all the neighbours
the figure was far taller than that of stapleton far thinner than that of frankland
barrymore it might possibly have been but we had left him behind us and i am certain that he could not have followed us
a stranger then is still dogging us just as a stranger dogged us in london
we have never shaken him off
if i could lay my hands upon that man then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties
to this one purpose i must now devote all my energies
my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans
my second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone
he is silent and distrait
his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor
i will say nothing to add to his anxieties but i will take my own steps to attain my own end
we had a small scene this morning after breakfast
barrymore asked leave to speak with sir henry and they were closeted in his study some little time
sitting in the billiardroom i more than once heard the sound of voices raised and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion
after a time the baronet opened his door and called for me
barrymore considers that he has a grievance he said
he thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brotherinlaw down when he of his own free will had told us the secret  the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us
i may have spoken too warmly sir said he and if i have i am sure that i beg your pardon
at the same time i was very much surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing selden
the poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track  if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing said the baronet you only told us or rather your wife only told us when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself  i didnt think you would have taken advantage of it sir henryindeed i didnt  the man is a public danger
there are lonely houses scattered over the moor and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing
you only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that
look at mr stapletons house for example with no one but himself to defend it
theres no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key  hell break into no house sir
i give you my solemn word upon that
but he will never trouble anyone in this country again
i assure you sir henry that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to south america
for gods sake sir i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor
they have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him
you cant tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble
i beg you sir to say nothing to the police  what do you say watson  i shrugged my shoulders
if he were safely out of the country it would relieve the taxpayer of a burden  but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes  he would not do anything so mad sir
we have provided him with all that he can want
to commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding  that is true said sir henry
well barrymore  god bless you sir and thank you from my heart
it would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again  i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony watson
but after what we have heard i dont feel as if i could give the man up so there is an end of it
all right barrymore you can go  with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned but he hesitated and then came back
youve been so kind to us sir that i should like to do the best i can for you in return
i know something sir henry and perhaps i should have said it before but it was long after the inquest that i found it out
ive never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man
its about poor sir charless death  the baronet and i were both upon our feet
do you know how he died  no sir i dont know that  what then  i know why he was at the gate at that hour
it was to meet a woman  to meet a woman
he  yes sir  and the womans name  i cant give you the name sir but i can give you the initials
her initials were l l  how do you know this barrymore  well sir henry your uncle had a letter that morning
he had usually a great many letters for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him
but that morning as it chanced there was only this one letter so i took the more notice of it
it was from coombe tracey and it was addressed in a womans hand  well  well sir i thought no more of the matter and never would have done had it not been for my wife
only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charless studyit had never been touched since his deathand she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate
the greater part of it was charred to pieces but one little slip the end of a page hung together and the writing could still be read though it was gray on a black ground
it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said please please as you are a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o clock
beneath it were signed the initials l l  have you got that slip  no sir it crumbled all to bits after we moved it  had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing  well sir i took no particular notice of his letters
i should not have noticed this one only it happened to come alone  and you have no idea who l l is  no sir
no more than you have
but i expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charless death  i cannot understand barrymore how you came to conceal this important information  well sir it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us
and then again sir we were both of us very fond of sir charles as we well might be considering all that he has done for us
to rake this up couldnt help our poor master and its well to go carefully when theres a lady in the case
even the best of us  you thought it might injure his reputation  well sir i thought no good could come of it
but now you have been kind to us and i feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter  very good barrymore you can go when the butler had left us sir henry turned to me
well watson what do you think of this new light  it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before  so i think
but if we can only trace l l it should clear up the whole business
we have gained that much
we know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her
what do you think we should do  let holmes know all about it at once
it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking
i am much mistaken if it does not bring him down  i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the mornings conversation for holmes
it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission
no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties
and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest
i wish that he were here
october th
all day today the rain poured down rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves
i thought of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless moor
poor devil
whatever his crimes he has suffered something to atone for them
and then i thought of that other onethe face in the cab the figure against the moon
was he also out in that delugedthe unseen watcher the man of darkness
in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the sodden moor full of dark imaginings the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears
god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass
i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs
rain squalls drifted across their russet face and the heavy slatecoloured clouds hung low over the landscape trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills
in the distant hollow on the left half hidden by the mist the two thin towers of baskerville hall rose above the trees
they were the only signs of human life which i could see save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills
nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights before
as i walked back i was overtaken by dr mortimer driving in his dogcart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire
he has been very attentive to us and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on
he insisted upon my climbing into his dogcart and he gave me a lift homeward
i found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel
it had wandered on to the moor and had never come back
i gave him such consolation as i might but i thought of the pony on the grimpen mire and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again
by the way mortimer said i as we jolted along the rough road i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know  hardly any i think  can you then tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l l  he thought for a few minutes
no said he
there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom i cant answer but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those
wait a bit though he added after a pause
there is laura lyonsher initials are l lbut she lives in coombe tracey  who is she i asked
she is franklands daughter  what
old frankland the crank  exactly
she married an artist named lyons who came sketching on the moor
he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her
the fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side
her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well
so between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time  how does she live  i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance but it cannot be more for his own affairs are considerably involved
whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad
her story got about and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living
stapleton did for one and sir charles for another
i gave a trifle myself
it was to set her up in a typewriting business  he wanted to know the object of my inquiries but i managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence
tomorrow morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey and if i can see this mrs laura lyons of equivocal reputation a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries
i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type franklands skull belonged and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing
i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day
this was my conversation with barrymore just now which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time
mortimer had stayed to dinner and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards
the butler brought me my coffee into the library and i took the chance to ask him a few questions
well said i has this precious relation of yours departed or is he still lurking out yonder  i dont know sir
i hope to heaven that he has gone for he has brought nothing but trouble here
ive not heard of him since i left out food for him last and that was three days ago  did you see him then  no sir but the food was gone when next i went that way  then he was certainly there  so you would think sir unless it was the other man who took it  i sat with my coffeecup halfway to my lips and stared at barrymore
you know that there is another man then  yes sir there is another man upon the moor  have you seen him  no sir  how do you know of him then  selden told me of him sir a week ago or more
hes in hiding too but hes not a convict as far as i can make out
i dont like it dr watsoni tell you straight sir that i dont like it he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness
now listen to me barrymore
i have no interest in this matter but that of your master
i have come here with no object except to help him
tell me frankly what it is that you dont like  barrymore hesitated for a moment as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words
its all these goingson sir he cried at last waving his hand towards the rainlashed window which faced the moor
theres foul play somewhere and theres black villainy brewing to that ill swear
very glad i should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again  but what is it that alarms you  look at sir charless death
that was bad enough for all that the coroner said
look at the noises on the moor at night
theres not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it
look at this stranger hiding out yonder and watching and waiting
whats he waiting for
what does it mean
it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henrys new servants are ready to take over the hall  but about this stranger said i
can you tell me anything about him
what did selden say
did he find out where he hid or what he was doing  he saw him once or twice but he is a deep one and gives nothing away
at first he thought that he was the police but soon he found that he had some lay of his own
a kind of gentleman he was as far as he could see but what he was doing he could not make out  and where did he say that he lived  among the old houses on the hillsidethe stone huts where the old folk used to live  but how about his food  selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs
i dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what he wants  very good barrymore
we may talk further of this some other time  when the butler had gone i walked over to the black window and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the windswept trees
it is a wild night indoors and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor
what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time
and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial
there in that hut upon the moor seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely
i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery
chapter 
the man on the tor    the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion
the incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time
i start them from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established two facts of great importance the one that mrs laura lyons of coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside
with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark places
i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs lyons upon the evening before for dr mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late
at breakfast however i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to coombe tracey
at first he was very eager to come but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better
the more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain
i left sir henry behind therefore not without some prickings of conscience and drove off upon my new quest
when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate
i had no difficulty in finding her rooms which were central and well appointed
a maid showed me in without ceremony and as i entered the sittingroom a lady who was sitting before a remington typewriter sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome
her face fell however when she saw that i was a stranger and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit
the first impression left by mrs lyons was one of extreme beauty
her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour and her cheeks though considerably freckled were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose
admiration was i repeat the first impression
but the second was criticism
there was something subtly wrong with the face some coarseness of expression some hardness perhaps of eye some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty
but these of course are afterthoughts
at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit
i had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was
i have the pleasure said i of knowing your father  it was a clumsy introduction and the lady made me feel it
there is nothing in common between my father and me she said
i owe him nothing and his friends are not mine
if it were not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i might have starved for all that my father cared  it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to see you  the freckles started out on the ladys face
what can i tell you about him she asked and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter
you knew him did you not  i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness
if i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation  did you correspond with him  the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes
what is the object of these questions she asked sharply
the object is to avoid a public scandal
it is better that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control  she was silent and her face was still very pale
at last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner
well ill answer she said
what are your questions  did you correspond with sir charles  i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity  have you the dates of those letters  no  have you ever met him  yes once or twice when he came into coombe tracey
he was a very retiring man and he preferred to do good by stealth  but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he has done  she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness
there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me
one was mr stapleton a neighbour and intimate friend of sir charless
he was exceedingly kind and it was through him that sir charles learned about my affairs  i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton his almoner upon several occasions so the ladys statement bore the impress of truth upon it
did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you i continued
mrs lyons flushed with anger again
really sir this is a very extraordinary question  i am sorry madam but i must repeat it  then i answer certainly not  not on the very day of sir charless death  the flush had faded in an instant and a deathly face was before me
her dry lips could not speak the no which i saw rather than heard
surely your memory deceives you said i
i could even quote a passage of your letter
it ran please please as you are a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten oclock  i thought that she had fainted but she recovered herself by a supreme effort
is there no such thing as a gentleman she gasped
you do sir charles an injustice
he did burn the letter
but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned
you acknowledge now that you wrote it  yes i did write it she cried pouring out her soul in a torrent of words
i did write it
why should i deny it
i have no reason to be ashamed of it
i wished him to help me
i believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help so i asked him to meet me  but why at such an hour  because i had only just learned that he was going to london next day and might be away for months
there were reasons why i could not get there earlier  but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house  do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelors house  well what happened when you did get there  i never went  mrs
lyons  no i swear it to you on all i hold sacred
i never went
something intervened to prevent my going  what was that  that is a private matter
i cannot tell it  you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death but you deny that you kept the appointment  that is the truth  again and again i crossquestioned her but i could never get past that point
mrs
lyons said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive interview you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know
if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised
if your position is innocent why did you in the first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that date  because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal  and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy your letter  if you have read the letter you will know  i did not say that i had read all the letter  you quoted some of it  i quoted the postscript
the letter had as i said been burned and it was not all legible
i ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death  the matter is a very private one  the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation  i will tell you then
if you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it  i have heard so much  my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor
the law is upon his side and every day i am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him
at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met
it meant everything to mepeace of mind happiness selfrespecteverything
i knew sir charless generosity and i thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me  then how is it that you did not go  because i received help in the interval from another source  why then did you not write to sir charles and explain this  so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next morning  the womans story hung coherently together and all my questions were unable to shake it
i could only check it by finding if she had indeed instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy
it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to baskerville hall if she really had been for a trap would be necessary to take her there and could not have returned to coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning
such an excursion could not be kept secret
the probability was therefore that she was telling the truth or at least a part of the truth
i came away baffled and disheartened
once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission
and yet the more i thought of the ladys face and of her manner the more i felt that something was being held back from me
why should she turn so pale
why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her
why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy
surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe
for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor
and that was a most vague direction
i realized it as i drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people
barrymores only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor
but i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the black tor
that then should be the centre of my search
from there i should explore every hut upon the moor until i lighted upon the right one
if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips at the point of my revolver if necessary who he was and why he had dogged us so long
he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor
on the other hand if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i must remain there however long the vigil until he returned
holmes had missed him in london
it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed
luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry but now at last it came to my aid
and the messenger of good fortune was none other than mr frankland who was standing graywhiskered and redfaced outside the gate of his garden which opened on to the highroad along which i travelled
goodday dr watson cried he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me  my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter but i was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the opportunity was a good one
i alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time for dinner
then i followed frankland into his diningroom
it is a great day for me sirone of the redletter days of my life  he cried with many chuckles
i have brought off a double event
i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it
i have established a right of way through the centre of old middletons park slap across it sir within a hundred yards of his own front door
what do you think of that
well teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners confound them
and ive closed the wood where the fernworthy folk used to picnic
these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles
both cases decided dr watson and both in my favour
i havent had such a day since i had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren  how on earth did you do that  look it up in the books sir
it will repay readingfrankland v morland court of queens bench
it cost me  pounds but i got my verdict  did it do you any good  none sir none
i am proud to say that i had no interest in the matter
i act entirely from a sense of public duty
i have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight
i told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions
the county constabulary is in a scandalous state sir and it has not afforded me the protection to which i am entitled
the case of frankland v regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public
i told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my words have come true  how so i asked
the old man put on a very knowing expression
because i could tell them what they are dying to know but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way  i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip but now i began to wish to hear more of it
i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences
some poaching case no doubt said i with an indifferent manner
ha ha my boy a very much more important matter than that
what about the convict on the moor  i stared
you dont mean that you know where he is said i
i may not know exactly where he is but i am quite sure that i could help the police to lay their hands on him
has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him  he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth
no doubt said i but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor  i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food  my heart sank for barrymore
it was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody
but his next remark took a weight from my mind
youll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child
i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof
he passes along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be going except to the convict  here was luck indeed
and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest
a child
barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy
it was on his track and not upon the convicts that frankland had stumbled
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt
but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards
i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his fathers dinner  the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat
his eyes looked malignantly at me and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat
indeed sir said he pointing out over the widestretching moor
do you see that black tor over yonder
well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it
it is the stoniest part of the whole moor
is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station
your suggestion sir is a most absurd one  i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the facts
my submission pleased him and led him to further confidences
you may be sure sir that i have very good grounds before i come to an opinion
i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle
every day and sometimes twice a day i have been ablebut wait a moment dr watson
do my eyes deceive me or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside  it was several miles off but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray
come sir come cried frankland rushing upstairs
you will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself  the telescope a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod stood upon the flat leads of the house
frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction
quick dr watson quick before he passes over the hill  there he was sure enough a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder toiling slowly up the hill
when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky
he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air as one who dreads pursuit
then he vanished over the hill
well
am i right  certainly there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand  and what the errand is even a county constable could guess
but not one word shall they have from me and i bind you to secrecy also dr watson
not a word
you understand  just as you wish  they have treated me shamefullyshamefully
when the facts come out in frankland v regina i venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country
nothing would induce me to help the police in any way
for all they cared it might have been me instead of my effigy which these rascals burned at the stake
surely you are not going
you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion  but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me
i kept the road as long as his eye was on me and then i struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared
everything was working in my favour and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way
the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the hill and the long slopes beneath me were all goldengreen on one side and gray shadow on the other
a haze lay low upon the farthest skyline out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of belliver and vixen tor
over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement
one great gray bird a gull or curlew soared aloft in the blue heaven
he and i seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it
the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart
the boy was nowhere to be seen
but down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather
my heart leaped within me as i saw it
this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked
at last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding placehis secret was within my grasp
as i approached the hut walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly i satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation
a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door
all was silent within
the unknown might be lurking there or he might be prowling on the moor
my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure
throwing aside my cigarette i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walking swiftly up to the door i looked in
the place was empty
but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent
this was certainly where the man lived
some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered
the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate
beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket halffull of water
a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time and i saw as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light a pannikin and a halffull bottle of spirits standing in the corner
in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table and upon this stood a small cloth bundlethe same no doubt which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy
it contained a loaf of bread a tinned tongue and two tins of preserved peaches
as i set it down again after having examined it my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it
i raised it and this was what i read roughly scrawled in pencil dr
watson has gone to coombe tracey  for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message
it was i then and not sir henry who was being dogged by this secret man
he had not followed me himself but he had set an agentthe boy perhapsupon my track and this was his report
possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported
always there was this feeling of an unseen force a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes
if there was one report there might be others so i looked round the hut in search of them
there was no trace however of anything of the kind nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life
when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode
was he our malignant enemy or was he by chance our guardian angel
i swore that i would not leave the hut until i knew
outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold
its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire
there were the two towers of baskerville hall and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of grimpen
between the two behind the hill was the house of the stapletons
all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light and yet as i looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer
with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant
and then at last i heard him
far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone
then another and yet another coming nearer and nearer
i shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger
there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped
then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut
it is a lovely evening my dear watson said a wellknown voice
i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in     chapter 
death on the moor    for a moment or two i sat breathless hardly able to believe my ears
then my senses and my voice came back to me while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul
that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world
holmes i criedholmes  come out said he and please be careful with the revolver  i stooped under the rude lintel and there he sat upon a stone outside his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features
he was thin and worn but clear and alert his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind
in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor and he had contrived with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in baker street
i never was more glad to see anyone in my life said i as i wrung him by the hand
or more astonished eh  well i must confess to it  the surprise was not all on one side i assure you
i had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat still less that you were inside it until i was within twenty paces of the door  my footprint i presume  no watson i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world
if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley oxford street i know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood
you will see it there beside the path
you threw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut  exactly  i thought as muchand knowing your admirable tenacity i was convinced that you were sitting in ambush a weapon within reach waiting for the tenant to return
so you actually thought that i was the criminal  i did not know who you were but i was determined to find out  excellent watson
and how did you localize me
you saw me perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when i was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me  yes i saw you then  and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one  no your boy had been observed and that gave me a guide where to look  the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt
i could not make it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens he rose and peeped into the hut
ha i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies
whats this paper
so you have been to coombe tracey have you  yes  to see mrs laura lyons  exactly  well done
our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines and when we unite our results i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case  well i am glad from my heart that you are here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves
but how in the name of wonder did you come here and what have you been doing
i thought that you were in baker street working out that case of blackmailing  that was what i wished you to think  then you use me and yet do not trust me i cried with some bitterness
i think that i have deserved better at your hands holmes  my dear fellow you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seemed to play a trick upon you
in truth it was partly for your own sake that i did it and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself
had i been with sir henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard
as it is i have been able to get about as i could not possibly have done had i been living in the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment  but why keep me in the dark  for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery
you would have wished to tell me something or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run
i brought cartwright down with meyou remember the little chap at the express officeand he has seen after my simple wants a loaf of bread and a clean collar
what does man want more
he has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet and both have been invaluable  then my reports have all been wastedmy voice trembled as i recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them
holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket
here are your reports my dear fellow and very well thumbed i assure you
i made excellent arrangements and they are only delayed one day upon their way
i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case  i was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me but the warmth of holmess praise drove my anger from my mind
i felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i should not have known that he was upon the moor
thats better said he seeing the shadow rise from my face
and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs laura lyonsit was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone for i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter
in fact if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone tomorrow  the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor
the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth
there sitting together in the twilight i told holmes of my conversation with the lady
so interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied
this is most important said he when i had concluded
it fills up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair
you are aware perhaps that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man stapleton  i did not know of a close intimacy  there can be no doubt about the matter
they meet they write there is a complete understanding between them
now this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands
if i could only use it to detach his wife  his wife  i am giving you some information now in return for all that you have given me
the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is in reality his wife  good heavens holmes
are you sure of what you say
how could he have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her  sir henrys falling in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry
he took particular care that sir henry did not make love to her as you have yourself observed
i repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister  but why this elaborate deception  because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman  all my unspoken instincts my vague suspicions suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist
in that impassive colourless man with his straw hat and his butterflynet i seemed to see something terriblea creature of infinite patience and craft with a smiling face and a murderous heart
it is he then who is our enemyit is he who dogged us in london  so i read the riddle  and the warningit must have come from her  exactly  the shape of some monstrous villainy half seen half guessed loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long
but are you sure of this holmes
how do you know that the woman is his wife  because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you and i dare say he has many a time regretted it since
he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england
now there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster
there are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession
a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the man who had owned itthe name was differenthad disappeared with his wife
the descriptions agreed
when i learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete  the darkness was rising but much was still hidden by the shadows
if this woman is in truth his wife where does mrs laura lyons come in i asked
that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light
your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much
i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband
in that case regarding stapleton as an unmarried man she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife  and when she is undeceived  why then we may find the lady of service
it must be our first duty to see herboth of ustomorrow
dont you think watson that you are away from your charge rather long
your place should be at baskerville hall  the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor
a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky
one last question holmes i said as i rose
surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me
what is the meaning of it all
what is he after  holmess voice sank as he answered  it is murder watsonrefined coldblooded deliberate murder
do not ask me for particulars
my nets are closing upon him even as his are upon sir henry and with your help he is already almost at my mercy
there is but one danger which can threaten us
it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so
another daytwo at the mostand i have my case complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child
your mission today has justified itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side
hark  a terrible screama prolonged yell of horror and anguishburst out of the silence of the moor
that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins
oh my god i gasped
what is it
what does it mean  holmes had sprung to his feet and i saw his dark athletic outline at the door of the hut his shoulders stooping his head thrust forward his face peering into the darkness
hush he whispered
hush  the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain
now it burst upon our ears nearer louder more urgent than before
where is it holmes whispered and i knew from the thrill of his voice that he the man of iron was shaken to the soul
where is it watson  there i think i pointed into the darkness
no there  again the agonized cry swept through the silent night louder and much nearer than ever
and a new sound mingled with it a deep muttered rumble musical and yet menacing rising and falling like the low constant murmur of the sea
the hound cried holmes
come watson come
great heavens if we are too late  he had started running swiftly over the moor and i had followed at his heels
but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell and then a dull heavy thud
we halted and listened
not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night
i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted
he stamped his feet upon the ground
he has beaten us watson
we are too late  no no surely not  fool that i was to hold my hand
and you watson see what comes of abandoning your charge
but by heaven if the worst has happened well avenge him  blindly we ran through the gloom blundering against boulders forcing our way through gorse bushes panting up hills and rushing down slopes heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come
at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him but the shadows were thick upon the moor and nothing moved upon its dreary face
can you see anything  nothing  but hark what is that  a low moan had fallen upon our ears
there it was again upon our left
on that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stonestrewn slope
on its jagged face was spreadeagled some dark irregular object
as we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape
it was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground the head doubled under him at a horrible angle the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault
so grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul
not a whisper not a rustle rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped
holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror
the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim
and it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within usthe body of sir henry baskerville
there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suitthe very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in baker street
we caught the one clear glimpse of it and then the match flickered and went out even as the hope had gone out of our souls
holmes groaned and his face glimmered white through the darkness
the brute
the brute i cried with clenched hands
oh holmes i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate  i am more to blame than you watson
in order to have my case well rounded and complete i have thrown away the life of my client
it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career
but how could i knowhow could i knowthat he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings  that we should have heard his screamsmy god those screamsand yet have been unable to save him
where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death
it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant
and stapleton where is he
he shall answer for this deed  he shall
i will see to that
uncle and nephew have been murderedthe one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it
but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast
save from what we heard we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry has evidently died from the fall
but by heavens cunning as he is the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past  we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end
then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor half silver and half gloom
far away miles off in the direction of grimpen a single steady yellow light was shining
it could only come from the lonely abode of the stapletons
with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed
why should we not seize him at once  our case is not complete
the fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree
it is not what we know but what we can prove
if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet  what can we do  there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow
tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend  together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body black and clear against the silvered stones
the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears
we must send for help holmes
we cannot carry him all the way to the hall
good heavens are you mad  he had uttered a cry and bent over the body
now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand
could this be my stern selfcontained friend
these were hidden fires indeed
a beard
a beard
the man has a beard  a beard  it is not the baronetit iswhy it is my neighbour the convict  with feverish haste we had turned the body over and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold clear moon
there could be no doubt about the beetling forehead the sunken animal eyes
it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rockthe face of selden the criminal
then in an instant it was all clear to me
i remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to barrymore
barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in his escape
boots shirt capit was all sir henrys
the tragedy was still black enough but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country
i told holmes how the matter stood my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy
then the clothes have been the poor devils death said he
it is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of sir henrysthe boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all probabilityand so ran this man down
there is one very singular thing however how came selden in the darkness to know that the hound was on his trail  he heard him  to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help
by his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track
how did he know  a greater mystery to me is why this hound presuming that all our conjectures are correct  i presume nothing  well then why this hound should be loose tonight
i suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor
stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would be there  my difficulty is the more formidable of the two for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever a mystery
the question now is what shall we do with this poor wretchs body
we cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens  i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police  exactly
i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far
halloa watson whats this
its the man himself by all thats wonderful and audacious
not a word to show your suspicionsnot a word or my plans crumble to the ground  a figure was approaching us over the moor and i saw the dull red glow of a cigar
the moon shone upon him and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist
he stopped when he saw us and then came on again
why dr watson thats not you is it
you are the last man that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night
but dear me whats this
somebody hurt
notdont tell me that it is our friend sir henry he hurried past me and stooped over the dead man
i heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers
whowhos this he stammered
it is selden the man who escaped from princetown  stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment
he looked sharply from holmes to me
dear me
what a very shocking affair
how did he die  he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks
my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry  i heard a cry also
that was what brought me out
i was uneasy about sir henry  why about sir henry in particular i could not help asking
because i had suggested that he should come over
when he did not come i was surprised and i naturally became alarmed for his safety when i heard cries upon the moor
by the wayhis eyes darted again from my face to holmessdid you hear anything else besides a cry  no said holmes did you  no  what do you mean then  oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound and so on
it is said to be heard at night upon the moor
i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight  we heard nothing of the kind said i
and what is your theory of this poor fellows death  i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head
he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck  that seems the most reasonable theory said stapleton and he gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief
what do you think about it mr sherlock holmes  my friend bowed his compliments
you are quick at identification said he
we have been expecting you in these parts since dr watson came down
you are in time to see a tragedy  yes indeed
i have no doubt that my friends explanation will cover the facts
i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me tomorrow  oh you return tomorrow  that is my intention  i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us  holmes shrugged his shoulders
one cannot always have the success for which one hopes
an investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours
it has not been a satisfactory case  my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner
stapleton still looked hard at him
then he turned to me
i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in doing it
i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning  and so it was arranged
resisting stapletons offer of hospitality holmes and i set off to baskerville hall leaving the naturalist to return alone
looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end
chapter 
fixing the nets    were at close grips at last said holmes as we walked together across the moor
what a nerve the fellow has
how he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot
i told you in london watson and i tell you now again that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel  i am sorry that he has seen you  and so was i at first
but there was no getting out of it  what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here  it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measures at once
like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us  why should we not arrest him at once  my dear watson you were born to be a man of action
your instinct is always to do something energetic
but supposing for arguments sake that we had him arrested tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that
we could prove nothing against him
theres the devilish cunning of it
if he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master  surely we have a case  not a shadow of oneonly surmise and conjecture
we should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence  there is sir charless death  found dead without a mark upon him
you and i know that he died of sheer fright and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it
what signs are there of a hound
where are the marks of its fangs
of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him
but we have to prove all this and we are not in a position to do it  well then tonight  we are not much better off tonight
again there was no direct connection between the hound and the mans death
we never saw the hound
we heard it but we could not prove that it was running upon this mans trail
there is a complete absence of motive
no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one  and how do you propose to do so  i have great hopes of what mrs laura lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her
and i have my own plan as well
sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof but i hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last  i could draw nothing further from him and he walked lost in thought as far as the baskerville gates
are you coming up  yes i see no reason for further concealment
but one last word watson
say nothing of the hound to sir henry
let him think that seldens death was as stapleton would have us believe
he will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he is engaged if i remember your report aright to dine with these people  and so am i  then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone
that will be easily arranged
and now if we are too late for dinner i think that we are both ready for our suppers  sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from london
he did raise his eyebrows however when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence
between us we soon supplied his wants and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know
but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to barrymore and his wife
to him it may have been an unmitigated relief but she wept bitterly in her apron
to all the world he was the man of violence half animal and half demon but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who had clung to her hand
evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him
ive been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the morning said the baronet
i guess i should have some credit for i have kept my promise
if i hadnt sworn not to go about alone i might have had a more lively evening for i had a message from stapleton asking me over there  i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening said holmes drily
by the way i dont suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck  sir henry opened his eyes
how was that  this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes
i fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police  that is unlikely
there was no mark on any of them as far as i know  thats lucky for himin fact its lucky for all of you since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter
i am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household
watsons reports are most incriminating documents  but how about the case asked the baronet
have you made anything out of the tangle
i dont know that watson and i are much the wiser since we came down  i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long
it has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business
there are several points upon which we still want lightbut it is coming all the same  weve had one experience as watson has no doubt told you
we heard the hound on the moor so i can swear that it is not all empty superstition
i had something to do with dogs when i was out west and i know one when i hear one
if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain ill be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time  i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help  whatever you tell me to do i will do  very good and i will ask you also to do it blindly without always asking the reason  just as you like  if you will do this i think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved
i have no doubt  he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air
the lamp beat upon his face and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clearcut classical statue a personification of alertness and expectation
what is it we both cried
i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion
his features were still composed but his eyes shone with amused exultation
excuse the admiration of a connoisseur said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall
watson wont allow that i know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ
now these are a really very fine series of portraits  well im glad to hear you say so said sir henry glancing with some surprise at my friend
i dont pretend to know much about these things and id be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture
i didnt know that you found time for such things  i know what is good when i see it and i see it now
thats a kneller ill swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds
they are all family portraits i presume  every one  do you know the names  barrymore has been coaching me in them and i think i can say my lessons fairly well  who is the gentleman with the telescope  that is rearadmiral baskerville who served under rodney in the west indies
the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskerville who was chairman of committees of the house of commons under pitt  and this cavalier opposite to methe one with the black velvet and the lace  ah you have a right to know about him
that is the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who started the hound of the baskervilles
were not likely to forget him  i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait
dear me said holmes he seems a quiet meekmannered man enough but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes
i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person  theres no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date  are on the back of the canvas  holmes said little more but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper
it was not until later when sir henry had gone to his room that i was able to follow the trend of his thoughts
he led me back into the banquetinghall his bedroom candle in his hand and he held it up against the timestained portrait on the wall
do you see anything there  i looked at the broad plumed hat the curling lovelocks the white lace collar and the straight severe face which was framed between them
it was not a brutal countenance but it was prim hard and stern with a firmset thinlipped mouth and a coldly intolerant eye
is it like anyone you know  there is something of sir henry about the jaw  just a suggestion perhaps
but wait an instant he stood upon a chair and holding up the light in his left hand he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets
good heavens i cried in amazement
the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas
ha you see it now
my eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings
it is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise  but this is marvellous
it might be his portrait  yes it is an interesting instance of a throwback which appears to be both physical and spiritual
a study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation
the fellow is a baskervillethat is evident  with designs upon the succession  exactly
this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links
we have him watson we have him and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies
a pin a cork and a card and we add him to the baker street collection he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture
i have not heard him laugh often and it has always boded ill to somebody
i was up betimes in the morning but holmes was afoot earlier still for i saw him as i dressed coming up the drive
yes we should have a full day today he remarked and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action
the nets are all in place and the drag is about to begin
well know before the day is out whether we have caught our big leanjawed pike or whether he has got through the meshes  have you been on the moor already  i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden
i think i can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter
and i have also communicated with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut as a dog does at his masters grave if i had not set his mind at rest about my safety  what is the next move  to see sir henry
ah here he is  goodmorning holmes said the baronet
you look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff  that is the exact situation
watson was asking for orders  and so do i  very good
you are engaged as i understand to dine with our friends the stapletons tonight  i hope that you will come also
they are very hospitable people and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you  i fear that watson and i must go to london  to london  yes i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture  the baronets face perceptibly lengthened
i hoped that you were going to see me through this business
the hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone  my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you
you can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you but that urgent business required us to be in town
we hope very soon to return to devonshire
will you remember to give them that message  if you insist upon it  there is no alternative i assure you  i saw by the baronets clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion
when do you desire to go he asked coldly
immediately after breakfast
we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you
watson you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come  i have a good mind to go to london with you said the baronet
why should i stay here alone  because it is your post of duty
because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told and i tell you to stay  all right then ill stay  one more direction
i wish you to drive to merripit house
send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home  to walk across the moor  yes  but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do  this time you may do it with safety
if i had not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it but it is essential that you should do it  then i will do it  and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit house to the grimpen road and is your natural way home  i will do just what you say  very good
i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon  i was much astounded by this programme though i remembered that holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day
it had not crossed my mind however that he would wish me to go with him nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical
there was nothing for it however but implicit obedience so we bade goodbye to our rueful friend and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey
a small boy was waiting upon the platform
any orders sir  you will take this train to town cartwright
the moment you arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is to send it by registered post to baker street  yes sir  and ask at the station office if there is a message for me  the boy returned with a telegram which holmes handed to me
it ran  wire received
coming down with unsigned warrant
arrive fiveforty
lestrade
that is in answer to mine of this morning
he is the best of the professionals i think and we may need his assistance
now watson i think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance mrs laura lyons  his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident
he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed
that telegram from london if mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons must remove the last suspicions from their minds
already i seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike
mrs laura lyons was in her office and sherlock holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her
i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late sir charles baskerville said he
my friend here dr watson has informed me of what you have communicated and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter  what have i withheld she asked defiantly
you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten oclock
we know that that was the place and hour of his death
you have withheld what the connection is between these events  there is no connection  in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one
but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all
i wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs lyons
we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr stapleton but his wife as well  the lady sprang from her chair
his wife she cried
the fact is no longer a secret
the person who has passed for his sister is really his wife  mrs lyons had resumed her seat
her hands were grasping the arms of her chair and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip
his wife she said again
his wife
he is not a married man  sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders
prove it to me
prove it to me
and if you can do so  the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words
i have come prepared to do so said holmes drawing several papers from his pocket
here is a photograph of the couple taken in york four years ago
it is indorsed mr
and mrs vandeleur but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him and her also if you know her by sight
here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of mr and mrs vandeleur who at that time kept st olivers private school
read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people  she glanced at them and then looked up at us with the set rigid face of a desperate woman
mr
holmes she said this man had offered me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband
he has lied to me the villain in every conceivable way
not one word of truth has he ever told me
and whywhy
i imagined that all was for my own sake
but now i see that i was never anything but a tool in his hands
why should i preserve faith with him who never kept any with me
why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts
ask me what you like and there is nothing which i shall hold back
one thing i swear to you and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest friend  i entirely believe you madam said sherlock holmes
the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred and you can check me if i make any material mistake
the sending of this letter was suggested to you by stapleton  he dictated it  i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce  exactly  and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment  he told me that it would hurt his selfrespect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us  he appears to be a very consistent character
and then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper  no  and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles  he did
he said that the death was a very mysterious one and that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out
he frightened me into remaining silent  quite so
but you had your suspicions  she hesitated and looked down
i knew him she said
but if he had kept faith with me i should always have done so with him  i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape said sherlock holmes
you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive
you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice
we must wish you goodmorning now mrs lyons and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again  our case becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us said holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town
i shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times
students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in godno in little russia in the year  and of course there are the anderson murders in north carolina but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own
even now we have no clear case against this very wily man
but i shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night  the london express came roaring into the station and a small wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a firstclass carriage
we all three shook hands and i saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together
i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man
anything good he asked
the biggest thing for years said holmes
we have two hours before we need think of starting
i think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor
never been there
ah well i dont suppose you will forget your first visit     chapter 
the hound of the baskervilles    one of sherlock holmess defectsif indeed one may call it a defectwas that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment
partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him
partly also from his professional caution which urged him never to take any chances
the result however was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants
i had often suffered under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness
the great ordeal was in front of us at last we were about to make our final effort and yet holmes had said nothing and i could only surmise what his course of action would be
my nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again
every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure
our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation
it was a relief to me after that unnatural restraint when we at last passed franklands house and knew that we were drawing near to the hall and to the scene of action
we did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue
the wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith while we started to walk to merripit house
are you armed lestrade  the little detective smiled
as long as i have my trousers i have a hippocket and as long as i have my hippocket i have something in it  good
my friend and i are also ready for emergencies  youre mighty close about this affair mr holmes
whats the game now  a waiting game  my word it does not seem a very cheerful place said the detective with a shiver glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire
i see the lights of a house ahead of us  that is merripit house and the end of our journey
i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper  we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it
this will do said he
these rocks upon the right make an admirable screen  we are to wait here  yes we shall make our little ambush here
get into this hollow lestrade
you have been inside the house have you not watson
can you tell the position of the rooms
what are those latticed windows at this end  i think they are the kitchen windows  and the one beyond which shines so brightly  that is certainly the diningroom  the blinds are up
you know the lie of the land best
creep forward quietly and see what they are doingbut for heavens sake dont let them know that they are watched  i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard
creeping in its shadow i reached a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained window
there were only two men in the room sir henry and stapleton
they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table
both of them were smoking cigars and coffee and wine were in front of them
stapleton was talking with animation but the baronet looked pale and distrait
perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the illomened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind
as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room while sir henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair puffing at his cigar
i heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel
the steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which i crouched
looking over i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an outhouse in the corner of the orchard
a key turned in a lock and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within
he was only a minute or so inside and then i heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house
i saw him rejoin his guest and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what i had seen
you say watson that the lady is not there holmes asked when i had finished my report
no  where can she be then since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen  i cannot think where she is  i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense white fog
it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us low but thick and well defined
the moon shone on it and it looked like a great shimmering icefield with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface
holmess face was turned towards it and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift
its moving towards us watson  is that serious  very serious indeedthe one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans
he cant be very long now
it is already ten oclock
our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path  the night was clear and fine above us
the stars shone cold and bright while a halfmoon bathed the whole scene in a soft uncertain light
before us lay the dark bulk of the house its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silverspangled sky
broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor
one of them was suddenly shut off
the servants had left the kitchen
there only remained the lamp in the diningroom where the two men the murderous host and the unconscious guest still chatted over their cigars
every minute that white woolly plain which covered onehalf of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house
already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window
the farther wall of the orchard was already invisible and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour
as we watched it the fogwreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea
holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience
if he isnt out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered
in half an hour we wont be able to see our hands in front of us  shall we move farther back upon higher ground  yes i think it would be as well  so as the fogbank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house and still that dense white sea with the moon silvering its upper edge swept slowly and inexorably on
we are going too far said holmes
we dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us
at all costs we must hold our ground where we are he dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground
thank god i think that i hear him coming  a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor
crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silvertipped bank in front of us
the steps grew louder and through the fog as through a curtain there stepped the man whom we were awaiting
he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear starlit night
then he came swiftly along the path passed close to where we lay and went on up the long slope behind us
as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder like a man who is ill at ease
hist cried holmes and i heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol
look out
its coming  there was a thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank
the cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay and we glared at it all three uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it
i was at holmess elbow and i glanced for an instant at his face
it was pale and exultant his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight
but suddenly they started forward in a rigid fixed stare and his lips parted in amazement
at the same instant lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground
i sprang to my feet my inert hand grasping my pistol my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog
a hound it was an enormous coalblack hound but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen
fire burst from its open mouth its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame
never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage more appalling more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog
with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track following hard upon the footsteps of our friend
so paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve
then holmes and i both fired together and the creature gave a hideous howl which showed that one at least had hit him
he did not pause however but bounded onward
far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back his face white in the moonlight his hands raised in horror glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down
but that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds
if he was vulnerable he was mortal and if we could wound him we could kill him
never have i seen a man run as holmes ran that night
i am reckoned fleet of foot but he outpaced me as much as i outpaced the little professional
in front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and the deep roar of the hound
i was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl him to the ground and worry at his throat
but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creatures flank
with a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air it rolled upon its back four feet pawing furiously and then fell limp upon its side
i stooped panting and pressed my pistol to the dreadful shimmering head but it was useless to press the trigger
the giant hound was dead
sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen
we tore away his collar and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time
already our friends eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move
lestrade thrust his brandyflask between the baronets teeth and two frightened eyes were looking up at us
my god he whispered
what was it
what in heavens name was it  its dead whatever it is said holmes
weve laid the family ghost once and forever  in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us
it was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff but it appeared to be a combination of the twogaunt savage and as large as a small lioness
even now in the stillness of death the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small deepset cruel eyes were ringed with fire
i placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle and as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness
phosphorus i said
a cunning preparation of it said holmes sniffing at the dead animal
there is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent
we owe you a deep apology sir henry for having exposed you to this fright
i was prepared for a hound but not for such a creature as this
and the fog gave us little time to receive him  you have saved my life  having first endangered it
are you strong enough to stand  give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for anything
so
now if you will help me up
what do you propose to do  to leave you here
you are not fit for further adventures tonight
if you will wait one or other of us will go back with you to the hall  he tried to stagger to his feet but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb
we helped him to a rock where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands
we must leave you now said holmes
the rest of our work must be done and every moment is of importance
we have our case and now we only want our man
its a thousand to one against our finding him at the house he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path
those shots must have told him that the game was up  we were some distance off and this fog may have deadened them  he followed the hound to call him offof that you may be certain
no no hes gone by this time
but well search the house and make sure  the front door was open so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant who met us in the passage
there was no light save in the diningroom but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored
no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing
on the upper floor however one of the bedroom doors was locked
theres someone in here cried lestrade
i can hear a movement
open this door  a faint moaning and rustling came from within
holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open
pistol in hand we all three rushed into the room
but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see
instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement
the room had been fashioned into a small museum and the walls were lined by a number of glasstopped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man
in the centre of this room there was an upright beam which had been placed at some period as a support for the old wormeaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof
to this post a figure was tied so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman
one towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar
another covered the lower part of the face and over it two dark eyeseyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioningstared back at us
in a minute we had torn off the gag unswathed the bonds and mrs stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us
as her beautiful head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck
the brute cried holmes
here lestrade your brandybottle
put her in the chair
she has fainted from illusage and exhaustion  she opened her eyes again
is he safe she asked
has he escaped  he cannot escape us madam  no no i did not mean my husband
sir henry
is he safe  yes  and the hound  it is dead  she gave a long sigh of satisfaction
thank god
thank god
oh this villain
see how he has treated me  she shot her arms out from her sleeves and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises
but this is nothingnothing
it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled
i could endure it all illusage solitude a life of deception everything as long as i could still cling to the hope that i had his love but now i know that in this also i have been his dupe and his tool she broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke
you bear him no good will madam said holmes
tell us then where we shall find him
if you have ever aided him in evil help us now and so atone  there is but one place where he can have fled she answered
there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire
it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge
that is where he would fly  the fogbank lay like white wool against the window
holmes held the lamp towards it
see said he
no one could find his way into the grimpen mire tonight  she laughed and clapped her hands
her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment
he may find his way in but never out she cried
how can he see the guiding wands tonight
we planted them together he and i to mark the pathway through the mire
oh if i could only have plucked them out today
then indeed you would have had him at your mercy  it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted
meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall
the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved
but the shock of the nights adventures had shattered his nerves and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of dr mortimer
the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale hearty man that he had been before he became master of that illomened estate
and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which i have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner
on the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog
it helped us to realize the horror of this womans life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husbands track
we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog
from the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those greenscummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger
rank reeds and lush slimy waterplants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces while a false step plunged us more than once thighdeep into the dark quivering mire which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet
its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us
once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us
from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting
holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again
he held an old black boot in the air
meyers toronto was printed on the leather inside
it is worth a mud bath said he
it is our friend sir henrys missing boot  thrown there by stapleton in his flight  exactly
he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track
he fled when he knew the game was up still clutching it
and he hurled it away at this point of his flight
we know at least that he came so far in safety  but more than that we were never destined to know though there was much which we might surmise
there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them
but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes
if the earth told a true story then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night
somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in this cold and cruelhearted man is forever buried
many traces we found of him in the boggirt island where he had hid his savage ally
a huge drivingwheel and a shaft halffilled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine
beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp
in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined
a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris
a dog said holmes
by jove a curlyhaired spaniel
poor mortimer will never see his pet again
well i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed
he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear
on an emergency he could keep the hound in the outhouse at merripit but it was always a risk and it was only on the supreme day which he regarded as the end of all his efforts that he dared do it
this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed
it was suggested of course by the story of the family hellhound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death
no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed even as our friend did and as we ourselves might have done when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track
it was a cunning device for apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it as many have done upon the moor
i said it in london watson and i say it again now that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonderhe swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of greensplotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor
chapter 
a retrospection    it was the end of november and holmes and i sat upon a raw and foggy night on either side of a blazing fire in our sittingroom in baker street
since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he had defended the unfortunate mme
montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her stepdaughter mlle
carere the young lady who as it will be remembered was found six months later alive and married in new york
my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases so that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the baskerville mystery
i had waited patiently for the opportunity for i was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past
sir henry and dr mortimer were however in london on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves
they had called upon us that very afternoon so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion
the whole course of events said holmes from the point of view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct although to us who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts it all appeared exceedingly complex
i have had the advantage of two conversations with mrs stapleton and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us
you will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my indexed list of cases  perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory  certainly though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts in my mind
intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed
the barrister who has his case at his fingers ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more
so each of my cases displaces the last and mlle
carere has blurred my recollection of baskerville hall
tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood
so far as the case of the hound goes however i will give you the course of events as nearly as i can and you will suggest anything which i may have forgotten
my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville
he was a son of that rodger baskerville the younger brother of sir charles who fled with a sinister reputation to south america where he was said to have died unmarried
he did as a matter of fact marry and had one child this fellow whose real name is the same as his fathers
he married beryl garcia one of the beauties of costa rica and having purloined a considerable sum of public money he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england where he established a school in the east of yorkshire
his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he had used this mans ability to make the undertaking a success
fraser the tutor died however and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy
the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton and he brought the remains of his fortune his schemes for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england
i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had in his yorkshire days been the first to describe
we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us
the fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate
when he went to devonshire his plans were i believe exceedingly hazy but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister
the idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged
he meant in the end to have the estate and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end
his first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second was to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours
the baronet himself told him about the family hound and so prepared the way for his own death
stapleton as i will continue to call him knew that the old mans heart was weak and that a shock would kill him
so much he had learned from dr mortimer
he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously
his ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to death and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer
having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse
an ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound
the use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part
the dog he bought in london from ross and mangles the dealers in fulham road
it was the strongest and most savage in their possession
he brought it down by the north devon line and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks
he had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the grimpen mire and so had found a safe hidingplace for the creature
here he kennelled it and waited his chance
but it was some time coming
the old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night
several times stapleton lurked about with his hound but without avail
it was during these fruitless quests that he or rather his ally was seen by peasants and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation
he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin but here she proved unexpectedly independent
she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy
threats and even i am sorry to say blows refused to move her
she would have nothing to do with it and for a time stapleton was at a deadlock
he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir charles who had conceived a friendship for him made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman mrs laura lyons
by representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over her and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her
his plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the hall on the advice of dr mortimer with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide
he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power
he therefore put pressure upon mrs lyons to write this letter imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for london
he then by a specious argument prevented her from going and so had the chance for which he had waited
driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to get his hound to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting
the dog incited by its master sprang over the wicketgate and pursued the unfortunate baronet who fled screaming down the yew alley
in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes bounding after its victim
he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror
the hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path so that no track but the mans was visible
on seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him but finding him dead had turned away again
it was then that it left the print which was actually observed by dr mortimer
the hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities alarmed the countryside and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation
so much for the death of sir charles baskerville
you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer
his only accomplice was one who could never give him away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective
both of the women concerned in the case mrs stapleton and mrs laura lyons were left with a strong suspicion against stapleton
mrs stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man and also of the existence of the hound
mrs lyons knew neither of these things but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him
however both of them were under his influence and he had nothing to fear from them
the first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained
it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada
in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr mortimer and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville
stapletons first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all
he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her
it was for this reason that he took her to london with him
they lodged i find at the mexborough private hotel in craven street which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence
here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he disguised in a beard followed dr mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel
his wife had some inkling of his plans but she had such a fear of her husbanda fear founded upon brutal illtreatmentthat she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger
if the letter should fall into stapletons hands her own life would not be safe
eventually as we know she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message and addressing the letter in a disguised hand
it reached the baronet and gave him the first warning of his danger
it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir henrys attire so that in case he was driven to use the dog he might always have the means of setting him upon his track
with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once and we cannot doubt that the boots or chambermaid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design
by chance however the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and therefore useless for his purpose
he then had it returned and obtained anothera most instructive incident since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one
the more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined and the very point which appears to complicate a case is when duly considered and scientifically handled the one which is most likely to elucidate it
then we had the visit from our friends next morning shadowed always by stapleton in the cab
from his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance as well as from his general conduct i am inclined to think that stapletons career of crime has been by no means limited to this single baskerville affair
it is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country for none of which was any criminal ever arrested
the last of these at folkestone court in may was remarkable for the coldblooded pistolling of the page who surprised the masked and solitary burglar
i cannot doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man
we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman
from that moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london and that therefore there was no chance for him there
he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet  one moment said i
you have no doubt described the sequence of events correctly but there is one point which you have left unexplained
what became of the hound when its master was in london  i have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of importance
there can be no question that stapleton had a confidant though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him
there was an old manservant at merripit house whose name was anthony
his connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years as far back as the schoolmastering days so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife
this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country
it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in england while antonio is so in all spanish or spanishamerican countries
the man like mrs stapleton herself spoke good english but with a curious lisping accent
i have myself seen this old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked out
it is very probable therefore that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used
the stapletons then went down to devonshire whither they were soon followed by sir henry and you
one word now as to how i stood myself at that time
it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened i made a close inspection for the watermark
in doing so i held it within a few inches of my eyes and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine
there are seventyfive perfumes which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition
the scent suggested the presence of a lady and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons
thus i had made certain of the hound and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country
it was my game to watch stapleton
it was evident however that i could not do this if i were with you since he would be keenly on his guard
i deceived everybody therefore yourself included and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london
my hardships were not so great as you imagined though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case
i stayed for the most part at coombe tracey and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action
cartwright had come down with me and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me
i was dependent upon him for food and clean linen
when i was watching stapleton cartwright was frequently watching you so that i was able to keep my hand upon all the strings
i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey
they were of great service to me and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapletons
i was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how i stood
the case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the barrymores
this also you cleared up in a very effective way though i had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations
by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a complete knowledge of the whole business but i had not a case which could go to a jury
even stapletons attempt upon sir henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man
there seemed to be no alternative but to catch him redhanded and to do so we had to use sir henry alone and apparently unprotected as a bait
we did so and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton to his destruction
that sir henry should have been exposed to this is i must confess a reproach to my management of the case but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice
we succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr mortimer assure me will be a temporary one
a long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings
his love for the lady was deep and sincere and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her
it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout
there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incompatible emotions
it was at least absolutely effective
at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder
she was ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so
stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his selfcontained manner so cleverly concealed
by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired
on the day of the crisis however his wife turned suddenly against him
she had learned something of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner
she taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love
her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him
he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance of warning sir henry and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronets death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew
in this i fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation and that if we had not been there his doom would none the less have been sealed
a woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly
and now my dear watson without referring to my notes i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case
i do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained  he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound  the beast was savage and halfstarved
if its appearance did not frighten its victim to death at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered  no doubt
there only remains one difficulty
if stapleton came into the succession how could he explain the fact that he the heir had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property
how could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry  it is a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it
the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer
mrs stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions
there were three possible courses
he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income
we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty
and now my dear watson we have had some weeks of severe work and for one evening i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels
i have a box for les huguenots have you heard the de reszkes
might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcinis for a little dinner on the way
