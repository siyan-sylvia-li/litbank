i   the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was at rest
the flood had made the wind was nearly calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide
the seareach of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway
in the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits
a haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness
the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest and the greatest town on earth
the director of companies was our captain and our host
we four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward
on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical
he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified
it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom
between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of the sea
besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarnsand even convictions
the lawyerthe best of old fellowshad because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck and was lying on the only rug
the accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones
marlow sat crosslegged right aft leaning against the mizzenmast
he had sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an idol
the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way aft and sat down amongst us
we exchanged a few words lazily
afterwards there was silence on board the yacht
for some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes
we felt meditative and fit for nothing but placid staring
the day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance
the water shone pacifically the sky without a speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds
only the gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more sombre every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun
and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men
forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound
the old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth
we looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories
and indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes followed the sea with reverence and affection than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames
the tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea
it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled and untitledthe great knightserrant of the sea
it had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from the golden hind returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure to be visited by the queen's highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale to the erebus and terror bound on other conquestsand that never returned
it had known the ships and the men
they had sailed from deptford from greenwich from eriththe adventurers and the settlers kings' ships and the ships of men on 'change captains admirals the dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals  of east india fleets
hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the sacred fire
what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth
the dreams of men the seed of commonwealths the germs of empires
the sun set the dusk fell on the stream and lights began to appear along the shore
the chapman lighthouse a threelegged thing erect on a mudflat shone strongly
lights of ships moved in the fairwaya great stir of lights going up and going down
and farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky a brooding gloom in sunshine a lurid glare under the stars
and this also said marlow suddenly has been one of the dark places of the earth  he was the only man of us who still followed the sea the worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class
he was a seaman but he was a wanderer too while most seamen lead if one may so express it a sedentary life
their minds are of the stayathome order and their home is always with themthe ship and so is their countrythe sea
one ship is very much like another and the sea is always the same
in the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores the foreign faces the changing immensity of life glide past veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny
for the rest after his hours of work a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing
the yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut
but marlow was not typical if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine
his remark did not seem at all surprising
it was just like marlow
it was accepted in silence
no one took the trouble to grunt even and presently he said very slowi was thinking of very old times when the romans first came here nineteen hundred years agothe other day  light came out of this river sinceyou say knights
yes but it is like a running blaze on a plain like a flash of lightning in the clouds
we live in the flickermay it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling
but darkness was here yesterday
imagine the feelings of a commander of a finewhat d'ye call 'emtrireme in the mediterranean ordered suddenly to the north run overland across the gauls in a hurry put in charge of one of these craft the legionariesa wonderful lot of handy men they must have been tooused to build apparently by the hundred in a month or two if we may believe what we read
imagine him herethe very end of the world a sea the colour of lead a sky the colour of smoke a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertinaand going up this river with stores or orders or what you like
sandbanks marshes forests savagesprecious little to eat fit for a civilized man nothing but thames water to drink
no falernian wine here no going ashore
here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness like a needle in a bundle of haycold fog tempests disease exile and deathdeath skulking in the air in the water in the bush
they must have been dying like flies here
oh yeshe did it
did it very well too no doubt and without thinking much about it either except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time perhaps
they were men enough to face the darkness
and perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at ravenna by and by if he had good friends in rome and survived the awful climate
or think of a decent young citizen in a togaperhaps too much dice you knowcoming out here in the train of some prefect or taxgatherer or trader even to mend his fortunes
land in a swamp march through the woods and in some inland post feel the savagery the utter savagery had closed round himall that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest in the jungles in the hearts of wild men
there's no initiation either into such mysteries
he has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible which is also detestable
and it has a fascination too that goes to work upon him
the fascination of the abominationyou know imagine the growing regrets the longing to escape the powerless disgust the surrender the hate  he paused
mind he began again lifting one arm from the elbow the palm of the hand outwards so that with his legs folded before him he had the pose of a buddha preaching in european clothes and without a lotusflowermind none of us would feel exactly like this
what saves us is efficiencythe devotion to efficiency
but these chaps were not much account really
they were no colonists their administration was merely a squeeze and nothing more i suspect
they were conquerors and for that you want only brute forcenothing to boast of when you have it since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others
they grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got
it was just robbery with violence aggravated murder on a great scale and men going at it blindas is very proper for those who tackle a darkness
the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much
what redeems it is the idea only
an idea at the back of it not a sentimental pretence but an idea and an unselfish belief in the ideasomething you can set up and bow down before and offer a sacrifice to  he broke off
flames glided in the river small green flames red flames white flames pursuing overtaking joining crossing each otherthen separating slowly or hastily
the traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river
we looked on waiting patientlythere was nothing else to do till the end of the flood but it was only after a long silence when he said in a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn freshwater sailor for a bit that we knew we were fated before the ebb began to run to hear about one of marlow's inconclusive experiences
i don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally  he began showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to hear yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how i got out there what i saw how i went up that river to the place where i first met the poor chap
it was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience
it seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about meand into my thoughts
it was sombre enough tooand pitifulnot extraordinary in any waynot very clear either
no not very clear
and yet it seemed to throw a kind of light
i had then as you remember just returned to london after a lot of indian ocean pacific china seasa regular dose of the eastsix years or so and i was loafing about hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes just as though i had got a heavenly mission to civilize you
it was very fine for a time but after a bit i did get tired of resting
then i began to look for a shipi should think the hardest work on earth
but the ships wouldn't even look at me
and i got tired of that game too
now when i was a little chap i had a passion for maps
i would look for hours at south america or africa or australia and lose myself in all the glories of exploration
at that time there were many blank spaces on the earth and when i saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map but they all look that i would put my finger on it and say 'when i grow up i will go there'
the north pole was one of these places i remember
well i haven't been there yet and shall not try now
the glamour's off
other places were scattered about the hemispheres
i have been in some of them and well we won't talk about that
but there was one yetthe biggest the most blank so to speakthat i had a hankering after
true by this time it was not a blank space any more
it had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names
it had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mysterya white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over
it had become a place of darkness
but there was in it one river especially a mighty big river that you could see on the map resembling an immense snake uncoiled with its head in the sea its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land
and as i looked at the map of it in a shopwindow it fascinated me as a snake would a birda silly little bird
then i remembered there was a big concern a company for trade on that river
dash it all
i thought to myself they can't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh watersteamboats
why shouldn't i try to get charge of one
i went on along fleet street but could not shake off the idea
the snake had charmed me
you understand it was a continental concern that trading society but i have a lot of relations living on the continent because it's cheap and not so nasty as it looks they say
i am sorry to own i began to worry them
this was already a fresh departure for me
i was not used to get things that way you know
i always went my own road and on my own legs where i had a mind to go
i wouldn't have believed it of myself but thenyou seei felt somehow i must get there by hook or by crook
so i worried them
the men said 'my dear fellow' and did nothing
thenwould you believe iti tried the women
i charlie marlow set the women to workto get a job
heavens
well you see the notion drove me
i had an aunt a dear enthusiastic soul
she wrote 'it will be delightful
i am ready to do anything anything for you
it is a glorious idea
i know the wife of a very high personage in the administration and also a man who has lots of influence with' etc
she was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat if such was my fancy
i got my appointmentof course and i got it very quick
it appears the company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives
this was my chance and it made me the more anxious to go
it was only months and months afterwards when i made the attempt to recover what was left of the body that i heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens
yes two black hens
fresleventhat was the fellow's name a danethought himself wronged somehow in the bargain so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick
oh it didn't surprise me in the least to hear this and at the same time to be told that fresleven was the gentlest quietest creature that ever walked on two legs
no doubt he was but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause you know and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his selfrespect in some way
therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly while a big crowd of his people watched him thunderstruck till some mani was told the chief's sonin desperation at hearing the old chap yell made a tentative jab with a spear at the white manand of course it went quite easy between the shoulderblades
then the whole population cleared into the forest expecting all kinds of calamities to happen while on the other hand the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic in charge of the engineer i believe
afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about fresleven's remains till i got out and stepped into his shoes
i couldn't let it rest though but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones
they were all there
the supernatural being had not been touched after he fell
and the village was deserted the huts gaped black rotting all askew within the fallen enclosures
a calamity had come to it sure enough
the people had vanished
mad terror had scattered them men women and children through the bush and they had never returned
what became of the hens i don't know either
i should think the cause of progress got them anyhow
however through this glorious affair i got my appointment before i had fairly begun to hope for it
i flew around like mad to get ready and before fortyeight hours i was crossing the channel to show myself to my employers and sign the contract
in a very few hours i arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre
prejudice no doubt
i had no difficulty in finding the company's offices
it was the biggest thing in the town and everybody i met was full of it
they were going to run an oversea empire and make no end of coin by trade
a narrow and deserted street in deep shadow high houses innumerable windows with venetian blinds a dead silence grass sprouting right and left immense double doors standing ponderously ajar
i slipped through one of these cracks went up a swept and ungarnished staircase as arid as a desert and opened the first door i came to
two women one fat and the other slim sat on strawbottomed chairs knitting black wool
the slim one got up and walked straight at mestill knitting with downcast eyesand only just as i began to think of getting out of her way as you would for a somnambulist stood still and looked up
her dress was as plain as an umbrellacover and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waitingroom
i gave my name and looked about
deal table in the middle plain chairs all round the walls on one end a large shining map marked with all the colours of a rainbow
there was a vast amount of redgood to see at any time because one knows that some real work is done in there a deuce of a lot of blue a little green smears of orange and on the east coast a purple patch to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lagerbeer
however i wasn't going into any of these
i was going into the yellow
dead in the centre
and the river was therefascinatingdeadlylike a snake
ough
a door opened a whitehaired secretarial head but wearing a compassionate expression appeared and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary
its light was dim and a heavy writingdesk squatted in the middle
from behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frockcoat
the great man himself
he was five feet six i should judge and had his grip on the handleend of ever so many millions
he shook hands i fancy murmured vaguely was satisfied with my french
bon voyage
in about fortyfive seconds i found myself again in the waitingroom with the compassionate secretary who full of desolation and sympathy made me sign some document
i believe i undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets
well i am not going to
i began to feel slightly uneasy
you know i am not used to such ceremonies and there was something ominous in the atmosphere
it was just as though i had been let into some conspiracyi don't knowsomething not quite right and i was glad to get out
in the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly
people were arriving and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them
the old one sat on her chair
her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a footwarmer and a cat reposed on her lap
she wore a starched white affair on her head had a wart on one cheek and silverrimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose
she glanced at me above the glasses
the swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me
two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom
she seemed to know all about them and about me too
an eerie feeling came over me
she seemed uncanny and fateful
often far away there i thought of these two guarding the door of darkness knitting black wool as for a warm pall one introducing introducing continuously to the unknown the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes
ave old knitter of black wool
morituri te salutant
not many of those she looked at ever saw her againnot half by a long way
there was yet a visit to the doctor
'a simple formality' assured me the secretary with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows
accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow some clerk i supposethere must have been clerks in the business though the house was as still as a house in a city of the deadcame from somewhere upstairs and led me forth
he was shabby and careless with inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket and his cravat was large and billowy under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot
it was a little too early for the doctor so i proposed a drink and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality
as we sat over our vermouths he glorified the company's business and by and by i expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there
he became very cool and collected all at once
'i am not such a fool as i look quoth plato to his disciples' he said sententiously emptied his glass with great resolution and we rose
the old doctor felt my pulse evidently thinking of something else the while
'good good for there' he mumbled and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether i would let him measure my head
rather surprised i said yes when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way taking notes carefully
he was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine with his feet in slippers and i thought him a harmless fool
'i always ask leave in the interests of science to measure the crania of those going out there' he said
'and when they come back too'
i asked
'oh i never see them' he remarked 'and moreover the changes take place inside you know'
he smiled as if at some quiet joke
'so you are going out there
famous
interesting too'
he gave me a searching glance and made another note
'ever any madness in your family'
he asked in a matteroffact tone
i felt very annoyed
'is that question in the interests of science too'
'it would be' he said without taking notice of my irritation 'interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals on the spot but' 'are you an alienist'
i interrupted
'every doctor should bea little' answered that original imperturbably
'i have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must help me to prove
this is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency
the mere wealth i leave to others
pardon my questions but you are the first englishman coming under my observation' i hastened to assure him i was not in the least typical
'if i were' said i 'i wouldn't be talking like this with you'
'what you say is rather profound and probably erroneous' he said with a laugh
'avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun
adieu
how do you english say eh
goodbye
ah
goodbye
adieu
in the tropics one must before everything keep calm'
he lifted a warning forefinger 'du calme du calme'
one thing more remained to dosay goodbye to my excellent aunt
i found her triumphant
i had a cup of teathe last decent cup of tea for many daysand in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady's drawingroom to look we had a long quiet chat by the fireside
in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me i had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary and goodness knows to how many more people besides as an exceptional and gifted creaturea piece of good fortune for the companya man you don't get hold of every day
good heavens
and i was going to take charge of a twopennyhalfpenny riversteamboat with a penny whistle attached
it appeared however i was also one of the workers with a capitalyou know
something like an emissary of light something like a lower sort of apostle
there had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time and the excellent woman living right in the rush of all that humbug got carried off her feet
she talked about 'weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways' till upon my word she made me quite uncomfortable
i ventured to hint that the company was run for profit
'you forget dear charlie that the labourer is worthy of his hire' she said brightly
it's queer how out of touch with truth women are
they live in a world of their own and there has never been anything like it and never can be
it is too beautiful altogether and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset
some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over
after this i got embraced told to wear flannel be sure to write often and so onand i left
in the streeti don't know whya queer feeling came to me that i was an imposter
odd thing that i who used to clear out for any part of the world at twentyfour hours' notice with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street had a momenti won't say of hesitation but of startled pause before this commonplace affair
the best way i can explain it to you is by saying that for a second or two i felt as though instead of going to the centre of a continent i were about to set off for the centre of the earth
i left in a french steamer and she called in every blamed port they have out there for as far as i could see the sole purpose of landing soldiers and customhouse officers
i watched the coast
watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma
there it is before yousmiling frowning inviting grand mean insipid or savage and always mute with an air of whispering 'come and find out'
this one was almost featureless as if still in the making with an aspect of monotonous grimness
the edge of a colossal jungle so darkgreen as to be almost black fringed with white surf ran straight like a ruled line far far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist
the sun was fierce the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam
here and there greyishwhitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf with a flag flying above them perhaps
settlements some centuries old and still no bigger than pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background
we pounded along stopped landed soldiers went on landed customhouse clerks to levy toll in what looked like a godforsaken wilderness with a tin shed and a flagpole lost in it landed more soldiersto take care of the customhouse clerks presumably
some i heard got drowned in the surf but whether they did or not nobody seemed particularly to care
they were just flung out there and on we went
every day the coast looked the same as though we had not moved but we passed various placestrading placeswith names like gran' bassam little popo names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth
the idleness of a passenger my isolation amongst all these men with whom i had no point of contact the oily and languid sea the uniform sombreness of the coast seemed to keep me away from the truth of things within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion
the voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure like the speech of a brother
it was something natural that had its reason that had a meaning
now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality
it was paddled by black fellows
you could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening
they shouted sang their bodies streamed with perspiration they had faces like grotesque masksthese chaps but they had bone muscle a wild vitality an intense energy of movement that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast
they wanted no excuse for being there
they were a great comfort to look at
for a time i would feel i belonged still to a world of straightforward facts but the feeling would not last long
something would turn up to scare it away
once i remember we came upon a manofwar anchored off the coast
there wasn't even a shed there and she was shelling the bush
it appears the french had one of their wars going on thereabouts
her ensign dropped limp like a rag the muzzles of the long sixinch guns stuck out all over the low hull the greasy slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down swaying her thin masts
in the empty immensity of earth sky and water there she was incomprehensible firing into a continent
pop would go one of the sixinch guns a small flame would dart and vanish a little white smoke would disappear a tiny projectile would give a feeble screechand nothing happened
nothing could happen
there was a touch of insanity in the proceeding a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of nativeshe called them enemieshidden out of sight somewhere
we gave her her letters i heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day and went on
we called at some more places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf as if nature herself had tried to ward off intruders in and out of rivers streams of death in life whose banks were rotting into mud whose waters thickened into slime invaded the contorted mangroves that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair
nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me
it was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares
it was upward of thirty days before i saw the mouth of the big river
we anchored off the seat of the government
but my work would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on
so as soon as i could i made a start for a place thirty miles higher up
i had my passage on a little seagoing steamer
her captain was a swede and knowing me for a seaman invited me on the bridge
he was a young man lean fair and morose with lanky hair and a shuffling gait
as we left the miserable little wharf he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore
'been living there'
he asked
i said 'yes'
'fine lot these government chapsare they not'
he went on speaking english with great precision and considerable bitterness
'it is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month
i wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry'
i said to him i expected to see that soon
'sooo'
he exclaimed
he shuffled athwart keeping one eye ahead vigilantly
'don't be too sure' he continued
'the other day i took up a man who hanged himself on the road
he was a swede too'
'hanged himself
why in god's name'
i cried
he kept on looking out watchfully
'who knows
the sun too much for him or the country perhaps'
at last we opened a reach
a rocky cliff appeared mounds of turnedup earth by the shore houses on a hill others with iron roofs amongst a waste of excavations or hanging to the declivity
a continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation
a lot of people mostly black and naked moved about like ants
a jetty projected into the river
a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare
'there's your company's station' said the swede pointing to three wooden barracklike structures on the rocky slope
'i will send your things up
four boxes did you say
so
farewell'
i came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass then found a path leading up the hill
it turned aside for the boulders and also for an undersized railwaytruck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air
one was off
the thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal
i came upon more pieces of decaying machinery a stack of rusty rails
to the left a clump of trees made a shady spot where dark things seemed to stir feebly
i blinked the path was steep
a horn tooted to the right and i saw the black people run
a heavy and dull detonation shook the ground a puff of smoke came out of the cliff and that was all
no change appeared on the face of the rock
they were building a railway
the cliff was not in the way or anything but this objectless blasting was all the work going on
a slight clinking behind me made me turn my head
six black men advanced in a file toiling up the path
they walked erect and slow balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads and the clink kept time with their footsteps
black rags were wound round their loins and the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails
i could see every rib the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope each had an iron collar on his neck and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them rhythmically clinking
another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war i had seen firing into a continent
it was the same kind of ominous voice but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies
they were called criminals and the outraged law like the bursting shells had come to them an insoluble mystery from the sea
all their meagre breasts panted together the violently dilated nostrils quivered the eyes stared stonily uphill
they passed me within six inches without a glance with that complete deathlike indifference of unhappy savages
behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed the product of the new forces at work strolled despondently carrying a rifle by its middle
he had a uniform jacket with one button off and seeing a white man on the path hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity
this was simple prudence white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who i might be
he was speedily reassured and with a large white rascally grin and a glance at his charge seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust
after all i also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings
instead of going up i turned and descended to the left
my idea was to let that chaingang get out of sight before i climbed the hill
you know i am not particularly tender i've had to strike and to fend off
i've had to resist and to attack sometimesthat's only one way of resistingwithout counting the exact cost according to the demands of such sort of life as i had blundered into
i've seen the devil of violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by all the stars
these were strong lusty redeyed devils that swayed and drove menmen i tell you
but as i stood on this hillside i foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become acquainted with a flabby pretending weakeyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly
how insidious he could be too i was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther
for a moment i stood appalled as though by a warning
finally i descended the hill obliquely towards the trees i had seen
i avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope the purpose of which i found it impossible to divine
it wasn't a quarry or a sandpit anyhow
it was just a hole
it might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do
i don't know
then i nearly fell into a very narrow ravine almost no more than a scar in the hillside
i discovered that a lot of imported drainagepipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there
there wasn't one that was not broken
it was a wanton smashup
at last i got under the trees
my purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment but no sooner within than it seemed to me i had stepped into the gloomy circle of some inferno
the rapids were near and an uninterrupted uniform headlong rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove where not a breath stirred not a leaf moved with a mysterious soundas though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible
black shapes crouched lay sat between the trees leaning against the trunks clinging to the earth half coming out half effaced within the dim light in all the attitudes of pain abandonment and despair
another mine on the cliff went off followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet
the work was going on
the work
and this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die
they were dying slowlyit was very clear
they were not enemies they were not criminals they were nothing earthly nownothing but black shadows of disease and starvation lying confusedly in the greenish gloom
brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts lost in uncongenial surroundings fed on unfamiliar food they sickened became inefficient and were then allowed to crawl away and rest
these moribund shapes were free as airand nearly as thin
i began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees
then glancing down i saw a face near my hand
the black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me enormous and vacant a kind of blind white flicker in the depths of the orbs which died out slowly
the man seemed youngalmost a boybut you know with them it's hard to tell
i found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good swede's ship's biscuits i had in my pocket
the fingers closed slowly on it and heldthere was no other movement and no other glance
he had tied a bit of white worsted round his neckwhy
where did he get it
was it a badgean ornamenta charma propitiatory act
was there any idea at all connected with it
it looked startling round his black neck this bit of white thread from beyond the seas
near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up
one with his chin propped on his knees stared at nothing in an intolerable and appalling manner his brother phantom rested its forehead as if overcome with a great weariness and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence
while i stood horrorstruck one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees and went off on allfours towards the river to drink
he lapped out of his hand then sat up in the sunlight crossing his shins in front of him and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone
i didn't want any more loitering in the shade and i made haste towards the station
when near the buildings i met a white man in such an unexpected elegance of getup that in the first moment i took him for a sort of vision
i saw a high starched collar white cuffs a light alpaca jacket snowy trousers a clean necktie and varnished boots
no hat
hair parted brushed oiled under a greenlined parasol held in a big white hand
he was amazing and had a penholder behind his ear
i shook hands with this miracle and i learned he was the company's chief accountant and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station
he had come out for a moment he said 'to get a breath of fresh air
the expression sounded wonderfully odd with its suggestion of sedentary desklife
i wouldn't have mentioned the fellow to you at all only it was from his lips that i first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time
moreover i respected the fellow
yes i respected his collars his vast cuffs his brushed hair
his appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser's dummy but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance
that's backbone
his starched collars and gotup shirtfronts were achievements of character
he had been out nearly three years and later i could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen
he had just the faintest blush and said modestly 'i've been teaching one of the native women about the station
it was difficult
she had a distaste for the work'
thus this man had verily accomplished something
and he was devoted to his books which were in applepie order
everything else in the station was in a muddleheads things buildings
strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed a stream of manufactured goods rubbishy cottons beads and brasswire sent into the depths of darkness and in return came a precious trickle of ivory
i had to wait in the station for ten daysan eternity
i lived in a hut in the yard but to be out of the chaos i would sometimes get into the accountant's office
it was built of horizontal planks and so badly put together that as he bent over his high desk he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight
there was no need to open the big shutter to see
it was hot there too big flies buzzed fiendishly and did not sting but stabbed
i sat generally on the floor while of faultless appearance and even slightly scented perching on a high stool he wrote he wrote
sometimes he stood up for exercise
when a trucklebed with a sick man some invalid agent from upcountry was put in there he exhibited a gentle annoyance
'the groans of this sick person' he said 'distract my attention
and without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate'
one day he remarked without lifting his head 'in the interior you will no doubt meet mr
kurtz'
on my asking who mr kurtz was he said he was a firstclass agent and seeing my disappointment at this information he added slowly laying down his pen 'he is a very remarkable person'
further questions elicited from him that mr kurtz was at present in charge of a tradingpost a very important one in the true ivorycountry at 'the very bottom of there
sends in as much ivory as all the others put together' he began to write again
the sick man was too ill to groan
the flies buzzed in a great peace
suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet
a caravan had come in
a violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks
all the carriers were speaking together and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tearfully for the twentieth time that day
he rose slowly
'what a frightful row' he said
he crossed the room gently to look at the sick man and returning said to me 'he does not hear'
'what
dead'
i asked startled
'no not yet' he answered with great composure
then alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the stationyard 'when one has got to make correct entries one comes to hate those savageshate them to the death'
he remained thoughtful for a moment
'when you see mr kurtz' he went on 'tell him from me that everything here'he glanced at the deck' is very satisfactory
i don't like to write to himwith those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letterat that central station'
he stared at me for a moment with his mild bulging eyes
'oh he will go far very far' he began again
'he will be a somebody in the administration before long
they abovethe council in europe you knowmean him to be'
he turned to his work
the noise outside had ceased and presently in going out i stopped at the door
in the steady buzz of flies the homewardbound agent was lying finished and insensible the other bent over his books was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions and fifty feet below the doorstep i could see the still treetops of the grove of death
next day i left that station at last with a caravan of sixty men for a twohundredmile tramp
no use telling you much about that
paths paths everywhere a stampedin network of paths spreading over the empty land through the long grass through burnt grass through thickets down and up chilly ravines up and down stony hills ablaze with heat and a solitude a solitude nobody not a hut
the population had cleared out a long time ago
well if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between deal and gravesend catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them i fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon
only here the dwellings were gone too
still i passed through several abandoned villages
there's something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls
day after day with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me each pair under a lb
load
camp cook sleep strike camp march
now and then a carrier dead in harness at rest in the long grass near the path with an empty watergourd and his long staff lying by his side
a great silence around and above
perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of faroff drums sinking swelling a tremor vast faint a sound weird appealing suggestive and wildand perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells in a christian country
once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform camping on the path with an armed escort of lank zanzibaris very hospitable and festivenot to say drunk
was looking after the upkeep of the road he declared
can't say i saw any road or any upkeep unless the body of a middleaged negro with a bullethole in the forehead upon which i absolutely stumbled three miles farther on may be considered as a permanent improvement
i had a white companion too not a bad chap but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides miles away from the least bit of shade and water
annoying you know to hold your own coat like a parasol over a man's head while he is coming to
i couldn't help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all
'to make money of course
what do you think'
he said scornfully
then he got fever and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole
as he weighed sixteen stone i had no end of rows with the carriers
they jibbed ran away sneaked off with their loads in the nightquite a mutiny
so one evening i made a speech in english with gestures not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me and the next morning i started the hammock off in front all right
an hour afterwards i came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bushman hammock groans blankets horrors
the heavy pole had skinned his poor nose
he was very anxious for me to kill somebody but there wasn't the shadow of a carrier near
i remembered the old doctor'it would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals on the spot'
i felt i was becoming scientifically interesting
however all that is to no purpose
on the fifteenth day i came in sight of the big river again and hobbled into the central station
it was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes
a neglected gap was all the gate it had and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show
white men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings strolling up to take a look at me and then retired out of sight somewhere
one of them a stout excitable chap with black moustaches informed me with great volubility and many digressions as soon as i told him who i was that my steamer was at the bottom of the river
i was thunderstruck
what how why
oh it was 'all right'
the 'manager himself' was there
all quite correct
'everybody had behaved splendidly
splendidly'
'you must' he said in agitation 'go and see the general manager at once
he is waiting'
i did not see the real significance of that wreck at once
i fancy i see it now but i am not surenot at all
certainly the affair was too stupidwhen i think of itto be altogether natural
still
but at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance
the steamer was sunk
they had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board in charge of some volunteer skipper and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones and she sank near the south bank
i asked myself what i was to do there now my boat was lost
as a matter of fact i had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river
i had to set about it the very next day
that and the repairs when i brought the pieces to the station took some months
my first interview with the manager was curious
he did not ask me to sit down after my twentymile walk that morning
he was commonplace in complexion in features in manners and in voice
he was of middle size and of ordinary build
his eyes of the usual blue were perhaps remarkably cold and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe
but even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention
otherwise there was only an indefinable faint expression of his lips something stealthya smilenot a smilei remember it but i can't explain
it was unconscious this smile was though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant
it came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable
he was a common trader from his youth up employed in these partsnothing more
he was obeyed yet he inspired neither love nor fear nor even respect
he inspired uneasiness
that was it
uneasiness
not a definite mistrustjust uneasinessnothing more
you have no idea how effective such a a faculty can be
he had no genius for organizing for initiative or for order even
that was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station
he had no learning and no intelligence
his position had come to himwhy
perhaps because he was never ill
he had served three terms of three years out there because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself
when he went home on leave he rioted on a large scalepompously
jack ashorewith a differencein externals only
this one could gather from his casual talk
he originated nothing he could keep the routine goingthat's all
but he was great
he was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man
he never gave that secret away
perhaps there was nothing within him
such a suspicion made one pausefor out there there were no external checks
once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the station he was heard to say 'men who come out here should have no entrails'
he sealed the utterance with that smile of his as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping
you fancied you had seen thingsbut the seal was on
when annoyed at mealtimes by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence he ordered an immense round table to be made for which a special house had to be built
this was the station's messroom
where he sat was the first placethe rest were nowhere
one felt this to be his unalterable conviction
he was neither civil nor uncivil
he was quiet
he allowed his 'boy'an overfed young negro from the coastto treat the white men under his very eyes with provoking insolence
he began to speak as soon as he saw me
i had been very long on the road
he could not wait
had to start without me
the upriver stations had to be relieved
there had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive and how they got onand so on and so on
he paid no attention to my explanations and playing with a stick of sealingwax repeated several times that the situation was 'very grave very grave'
there were rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy and its chief mr kurtz was ill hoped it was not true
mr kurtz was
i felt weary and irritable
hang kurtz i thought
i interrupted him by saying i had heard of mr kurtz on the coast
'ah
so they talk of him down there' he murmured to himself
then he began again assuring me mr kurtz was the best agent he had an exceptional man of the greatest importance to the company therefore i could understand his anxiety
he was he said 'very very uneasy'
certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal exclaimed 'ah mr
kurtz'
broke the stick of sealingwax and seemed dumfounded by the accident
next thing he wanted to know 'how long it would take to'
i interrupted him again
being hungry you know and kept on my feet too
i was getting savage
'how can i tell'
i said
'i haven't even seen the wreck yetsome months no doubt'
all this talk seemed to me so futile
'some months' he said
'well let us say three months before we can make a start
yes
that ought to do the affair'
i flung out of his hut he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah muttering to myself my opinion of him
he was a chattering idiot
afterwards i took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the 'affair'
i went to work the next day turning so to speak my back on that station
in that way only it seemed to me i could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life
still one must look about sometimes and then i saw this station these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard
i asked myself sometimes what it all meant
they wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence
the word 'ivory' rang in the air was whispered was sighed
you would think they were praying to it
a taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all like a whiff from some corpse
by jove
i've never seen anything so unreal in my life
and outside the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible like evil or truth waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion
oh these months
well never mind
various things happened
one evening a grass shed full of calico cotton prints beads and i don't know what else burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash
i was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer and saw them all cutting capers in the light with their arms lifted high when the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river a tin pail in his hand assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly splendidly' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again
i noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail
i strolled up
there was no hurry
you see the thing had gone off like a box of matches
it had been hopeless from the very first
the flame had leaped high driven everybody back lighted up everythingand collapsed
the shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely
a nigger was being beaten near by
they said he had caused the fire in some way be that as it may he was screeching most horribly
i saw him later for several days sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself afterwards he arose and went outand the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again
as i approached the glow from the dark i found myself at the back of two men talking
i heard the name of kurtz pronounced then the words 'take advantage of this unfortunate accident'
one of the men was the manager
i wished him a good evening
'did you ever see anything like iteh
it is incredible' he said and walked off
the other man remained
he was a firstclass agent young gentlemanly a bit reserved with a forked little beard and a hooked nose
he was standoffish with the other agents and they on their side said he was the manager's spy upon them
as to me i had hardly ever spoken to him before
we got into talk and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins
then he asked me to his room which was in the main building of the station
he struck a match and i perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silvermounted dressingcase but also a whole candle all to himself
just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles
native mats covered the clay walls a collection of spears assegais shields knives was hung up in trophies
the business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricksso i had been informed but there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station and he had been there more than a yearwaiting
it seems he could not make bricks without something i don't know whatstraw maybe
anyway it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be sent from europe it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for
an act of special creation perhaps
however they were all waitingall the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of themfor something and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation from the way they took it though the only thing that ever came to them was diseaseas far as i could see
they beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way
there was an air of plotting about that station but nothing came of it of course
it was as unreal as everything elseas the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern as their talk as their government as their show of work
the only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a tradingpost where ivory was to be had so that they could earn percentages
they intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that accountbut as to effectually lifting a little fingeroh no
by heavens
there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter
steal a horse straight out
very well
he has done it
perhaps he can ride
but there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick
i had no idea why he wanted to be sociable but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at somethingin fact pumping me
he alluded constantly to europe to the people i was supposed to know thereputting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city and so on
his little eyes glittered like mica discswith curiositythough he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness
at first i was astonished but very soon i became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me
i couldn't possibly imagine what i had in me to make it worth his while
it was very pretty to see how he baffled himself for in truth my body was full only of chills and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business
it was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator
at last he got angry and to conceal a movement of furious annoyance he yawned
i rose
then i noticed a small sketch in oils on a panel representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch
the background was sombrealmost black
the movement of the woman was stately and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister
it arrested me and he stood by civilly holding an empty halfpint champagne bottle medical comforts with the candle stuck in it
to my question he said mr kurtz had painted thisin this very station more than a year agowhile waiting for means to go to his trading post
'tell me pray' said i 'who is this mr
kurtz'
'the chief of the inner station' he answered in a short tone looking away
'much obliged' i said laughing
'and you are the brickmaker of the central station
every one knows that'
he was silent for a while
'he is a prodigy' he said at last
'he is an emissary of pity and science and progress and devil knows what else
we want' he began to declaim suddenly 'for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by europe so to speak higher intelligence wide sympathies a singleness of purpose'
'who says that'
i asked
'lots of them' he replied
'some even write that and so he comes here a special being as you ought to know'
'why ought i to know'
i interrupted really surprised
he paid no attention
'yes
today he is chief of the best station next year he will be assistantmanager two years more and but i daresay you know what he will be in two years' time
you are of the new gangthe gang of virtue
the same people who sent him specially also recommended you
oh don't say no
i've my own eyes to trust'
light dawned upon me
my dear aunt's influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man
i nearly burst into a laugh
'do you read the company's confidential correspondence'
i asked
he hadn't a word to say
it was great fun
'when mr kurtz' i continued severely 'is general manager you won't have the opportunity'
he blew the candle out suddenly and we went outside
the moon had risen
black figures strolled about listlessly pouring water on the glow whence proceeded a sound of hissing steam ascended in the moonlight the beaten nigger groaned somewhere
'what a row the brute makes'
said the indefatigable man with the moustaches appearing near us
'serve him right
transgressionpunishmentbang
pitiless pitiless
that's the only way
this will prevent all conflagrations for the future
i was just telling the manager' he noticed my companion and became crestfallen all at once
'not in bed yet' he said with a kind of servile heartiness 'it's so natural
ha
dangeragitation'
he vanished
i went on to the riverside and the other followed me
i heard a scathing murmur at my ear 'heap of muffsgo to'
the pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating discussing
several had still their staves in their hands
i verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them
beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight and through that dim stir through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard the silence of the land went home to one's very heartits mystery its greatness the amazing reality of its concealed life
the hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there
i felt a hand introducing itself under my arm
'my dear sir' said the fellow 'i don't want to be misunderstood and especially by you who will see mr kurtz long before i can have that pleasure
i wouldn't like him to get a false idea of my disposition'  i let him run on this papiermache mephistopheles and it seemed to me that if i tried i could poke my forefinger through him and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt maybe
he don't you see had been planning to be assistantmanager by and by under the present man and i could see that the coming of that kurtz had upset them both not a little
he talked precipitately and i did not try to stop him
i had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal
the smell of mud of primeval mud by jove
was in my nostrils the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes there were shiny patches on the black creek
the moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silverover the rank grass over the mud upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple over the great river i could see through a sombre gap glittering glittering as it flowed broadly by without a murmur
all this was great expectant mute while the man jabbered about himself
i wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace
what were we who had strayed in here
could we handle that dumb thing or would it handle us
i felt how big how confoundedly big was that thing that couldn't talk and perhaps was deaf as well
what was in there
i could see a little ivory coming out from there and i had heard mr kurtz was in there
i had heard enough about it toogod knows
yet somehow it didn't bring any image with itno more than if i had been told an angel or a fiend was in there
i believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet mars
i knew once a scotch sailmaker who was certain dead sure there were people in mars
if you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved he would get shy and mutter something about 'walking on allfours'
if you as much as smiled he wouldthough a man of sixtyoffer to fight you
i would not have gone so far as to fight for kurtz but i went for him near enough to a lie
you know i hate detest and can't bear a lie not because i am straighter than the rest of us but simply because it appalls me
there is a taint of death a flavour of mortality in lieswhich is exactly what i hate and detest in the worldwhat i want to forget
it makes me miserable and sick like biting something rotten would do
temperament i suppose
well i went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in europe
i became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims
this simply because i had a notion it somehow would be of help to that kurtz whom at the time i did not seeyou understand
he was just a word for me
i did not see the man in the name any more than you do
do you see him
do you see the story
do you see anything
it seems to me i am trying to tell you a dreammaking a vain attempt because no relation of a dream can convey the dreamsensation that commingling of absurdity surprise and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams  he was silent for a while
 no it is impossible it is impossible to convey the lifesensation of any given epoch of one's existencethat which makes its truth its meaningits subtle and penetrating essence
it is impossible
we live as we dreamalone  he paused again as if reflecting then added  of course in this you fellows see more than i could then
you see me whom you know  it had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another
for a long time already he sitting apart had been no more to us than a voice
there was not a word from anybody
the others might have been asleep but i was awake
i listened i listened on the watch for the sentence for the word that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy nightair of the river

yesi let him run on marlow began again and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me
i did
and there was nothing behind me
there was nothing but that wretched old mangled steamboat i was leaning against while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on'
'and when one comes out here you conceive it is not to gaze at the moon'
mr kurtz was a 'universal genius' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate toolsintelligent men'
he did not make brickswhy there was a physical impossibility in the wayas i was well aware and if he did secretarial work for the manager it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors'
did i see it
i saw it
what more did i want
what i really wanted was rivets by heaven
rivets
to get on with the workto stop the hole
rivets i wanted
there were cases of them down at the coastcasespiled upburstsplit
you kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that stationyard on the hillside
rivets had rolled into the grove of death
you could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping downand there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted
we had plates that would do but nothing to fasten them with
and every week the messenger a long negro letterbag on shoulder and staff in hand left our station for the coast
and several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goodsghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it glass beads value about a penny a quart confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs
and no rivets
three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat
he was becoming confidential now but i fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither god nor devil let alone any mere man
i said i could see that very well but what i wanted was a certain quantity of rivetsand rivets were what really mr kurtz wanted if he had only known it
now letters went to the coast every week 'my dear sir' he cried 'i write from dictation'
i demanded rivets
there was a wayfor an intelligent man
he changed his manner became very cold and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer i stuck to my salvage night and day i wasn't disturbed
there was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds
the pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him
some even had sat up o' nights for him
all this energy was wasted though
'that animal has a charmed life' he said 'but you can say this only of brutes in this country
no manyou apprehend meno man here bears a charmed life'
he stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew and his mica eyes glittering without a wink then with a curt goodnight he strode off
i could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled which made me feel more hopeful than i had been for days
it was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend the battered twisted ruined tinpot steamboat
i clambered on board
she rang under my feet like an empty huntley  palmer biscuittin kicked along a gutter she was nothing so solid in make and rather less pretty in shape but i had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her
no influential friend would have served me better
she had given me a chance to come out a bitto find out what i could do
no i don't like work
i had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done
i don't like workno man doesbut i like what is in the workthe chance to find yourself
your own realityfor yourself not for otherswhat no other man can ever know
they can only see the mere show and never can tell what it really means
i was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft on the deck with his legs dangling over the mud
you see i rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station whom the other pilgrims naturally despisedon account of their imperfect manners i suppose
this was the foremana boilermaker by tradea good worker
he was a lank bony yellowfaced man with big intense eyes
his aspect was worried and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin and had prospered in the new locality for his beard hung down to his waist
he was a widower with six young children he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there and the passion of his life was pigeonflying
he was an enthusiast and a connoisseur
he would rave about pigeons
after work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons at work when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose
it had loops to go over his ears
in the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry
i slapped him on the back and shouted 'we shall have rivets'
he scrambled to his feet exclaiming 'no
rivets'
as though he couldn't believe his ears
then in a low voice 'you
eh'
i don't know why we behaved like lunatics
i put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously
'good for you'
he cried snapped his fingers above his head lifting one foot
i tried a jig
we capered on the iron deck
a frightful clatter came out of that hulk and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station
it must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels
a dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager's hut vanished then a second or so after the doorway itself vanished too
we stopped and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land
the great wall of vegetation an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks branches leaves boughs festoons motionless in the moonlight was like a rioting invasion of soundless life a rolling wave of plants piled up crested ready to topple over the creek to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence
and it moved not
a deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar as though an icthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river
'after all' said the boilermaker in a reasonable tone 'why shouldn't we get the rivets'
why not indeed
i did not know of any reason why we shouldn't
'they'll come in three weeks' i said confidently
but they didn't
instead of rivets there came an invasion an infliction a visitation
it came in sections during the next three weeks each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims
a quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkey a lot of tents campstools tin boxes white cases brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station
five such instalments came with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores that one would think they were lugging after a raid into the wilderness for equitable division
it was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving
this devoted band called itself the eldorado exploring expedition and i believe they were sworn to secrecy
their talk however was the talk of sordid buccaneers it was reckless without hardihood greedy without audacity and cruel without courage there was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world
to tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe
who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise i don't know but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot
in exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning
he carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew
you could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab
i had given up worrying myself about the rivets
one's capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose
i said hangand let things slide
i had plenty of time for meditation and now and then i would give some thought to kurtz
i wasn't very interested in him
no
still i was curious to see whether this man who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort would climb to the top after all and how he would set about his work when there     ii    one evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat i heard voices approachingand there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank
i laid my head on my arm again and had nearly lost myself in a doze when somebody said in my ear as it were 'i am as harmless as a little child but i don't like to be dictated to
am i the manageror am i not
i was ordered to send him there
it's incredible'

i became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat just below my head
i did not move it did not occur to me to move i was sleepy
'it is unpleasant' grunted the uncle
'he has asked the administration to be sent there' said the other 'with the idea of showing what he could do and i was instructed accordingly
look at the influence that man must have
is it not frightful'
they both agreed it was frightful then made several bizarre remarks 'make rain and fine weatherone manthe councilby the nose'bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness so that i had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said 'the climate may do away with this difficulty for you
is he alone there'
'yes' answered the manager 'he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms clear this poor devil out of the country and don't bother sending more of that sort
i had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me it was more than a year ago
can you imagine such impudence'
'anything since then'
asked the other hoarsely
'ivory' jerked the nephew 'lots of itprime sortlotsmost annoying from him'
'and with that'
questioned the heavy rumble
'invoice' was the reply fired out so to speak
then silence
they had been talking about kurtz
i was broad awake by this time but lying perfectly at ease remained still having no inducement to change my position
'how did that ivory come all this way'
growled the elder man who seemed very vexed
the other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an english halfcaste clerk kurtz had with him that kurtz had apparently intended to return himself the station being by that time bare of goods and stores but after coming three hundred miles had suddenly decided to go back which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four paddlers leaving the halfcaste to continue down the river with the ivory
the two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing
they were at a loss for an adequate motive
as to me i seemed to see kurtz for the first time
it was a distinct glimpse the dugout four paddling savages and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters on relief on thoughts of homeperhaps setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness towards his empty and desolate station
i did not know the motive
perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake
his name you understand had not been pronounced once
he was 'that man'
the halfcaste who as far as i could see had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck was invariably alluded to as 'that scoundrel'
the 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very illhad recovered imperfectly
the two below me moved away then a few paces and strolled back and forth at some little distance
i heard 'military postdoctortwo hundred milesquite alone nowunavoidable delaysnine monthsno newsstrange rumours'
they approached again just as the manager was saying 'no one as far as i know unless a species of wandering tradera pestilential fellow snapping ivory from the natives'
who was it they were talking about now
i gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in kurtz's district and of whom the manager did not approve
'we will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example' he said
'certainly' grunted the other 'get him hanged
why not
anythinganything can be done in this country
that's what i say nobody here you understand here can endanger your position
and why
you stand the climateyou outlast them all
the danger is in europe but there before i left i took care to' they moved off and whispered then their voices rose again
'the extraordinary series of delays is not my fault
i did my best'
the fat man sighed
'very sad'
'and the pestiferous absurdity of his talk' continued the other 'he bothered me enough when he was here
each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things a centre for trade of course but also for humanizing improving instructing conceive youthat ass
and he wants to be manager
no it's' here he got choked by excessive indignation and i lifted my head the least bit
i was surprised to see how near they wereright under me
i could have spat upon their hats
they were looking on the ground absorbed in thought
the manager was switching his leg with a slender twig his sagacious relative lifted his head
'you have been well since you came out this time'
he asked
the other gave a start
'who
i
oh
like a charmlike a charm
but the restoh my goodness
all sick
they die so quick too that i haven't the time to send them out of the countryit's incredible'
'hm'm
just so' grunted the uncle
'ah
my boy trust to thisi say trust to this'
i saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest the creek the mud the riverseemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death to the hidden evil to the profound darkness of its heart
it was so startling that i leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest as though i had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence
you know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes
the high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion
they swore aloud togetherout of sheer fright i believethen pretending not to know anything of my existence turned back to the station
the sun was low and leaning forward side by side they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade
in a few days the eldorado expedition went into the patient wilderness that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver
long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead
i know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals
they no doubt like the rest of us found what they deserved
i did not inquire
i was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting kurtz very soon
when i say very soon i mean it comparatively
it was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below kurtz's station
going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings
an empty stream a great silence an impenetrable forest
the air was warm thick heavy sluggish
there was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine
the long stretches of the waterway ran on deserted into the gloom of overshadowed distances
on silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side
the broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert and butted all day long against shoals trying to find the channel till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known oncesomewherefar awayin another existence perhaps
there were moments when one's past came back to one as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for yourself but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants and water and silence
and this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace
it was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention
it looked at you with a vengeful aspect
i got used to it afterwards i did not see it any more i had no time
i had to keep guessing at the channel i had to discern mostly by inspiration the signs of hidden banks i watched for sunken stones i was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out when i shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tinpot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims i had to keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day's steaming
when you have to attend to things of that sort to the mere incidents of the surface the realitythe reality i tell youfades
the inner truth is hiddenluckily luckily
but i felt it all the same i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tightropes forwhat is it
halfacrown a tumble  try to be civil marlow growled a voice and i knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself
i beg your pardon
i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price
and indeed what does the price matter if the trick be well done
you do your tricks very well
and i didn't do badly either since i managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip
it's a wonder to me yet
imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road
i sweated and shivered over that business considerably i can tell you
after all for a seaman to scrape the bottom of the thing that's supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin
no one may know of it but you never forget the thumpeh
a blow on the very heart
you remember it you dream of it you wake up at night and think of ityears afterand go hot and cold all over
i don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time
more than once she had to wade for a bit with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing
we had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew
fine fellowscannibalsin their place
they were men one could work with and i am grateful to them
and after all they did not eat each other before my face they had brought along a provision of hippomeat which went rotten and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils
phoo
i can sniff it now
i had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their stavesall complete
sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank clinging to the skirts of the unknown and the white men rushing out of a tumbledown hovel with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome seemed very strangehad the appearance of being held there captive by a spell
the word ivory would ring in the air for a whileand on we went again into the silence along empty reaches round the still bends between the high walls of our winding way reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the sternwheel
trees trees millions of trees massive immense running up high and at their foot hugging the bank against the stream crept the little begrimed steamboat like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico
it made you feel very small very lost and yet it was not altogether depressing that feeling
after all if you were small the grimy beetle crawled onwhich was just what you wanted it to do
where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to i don't know
to some place where they expected to get something
i bet
for me it crawled towards kurtzexclusively but when the steampipes started leaking we crawled very slow
the reaches opened before us and closed behind as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return
we penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness
it was very quiet there
at night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly as if hovering in the air high over our heads till the first break of day
whether it meant war peace or prayer we could not tell
the dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness the woodcutters slept their fires burned low the snapping of a twig would make you start
we were wanderers on a prehistoric earth on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet
we could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil
but suddenly as we struggled round a bend there would be a glimpse of rush walls of peaked grassroofs a burst of yells a whirl of black limbs a mass of hands clapping of feet stamping of bodies swaying of eyes rolling under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage
the steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy
the prehistoric man was cursing us praying to us welcoming uswho could tell
we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings we glided past like phantoms wondering and secretly appalled as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse
we could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages of those ages that are gone leaving hardly a signand no memories
the earth seemed unearthly
we are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster but therethere you could look at a thing monstrous and free
it was unearthly and the men wereno they were not inhuman
well you know that was the worst of itthis suspicion of their not being inhuman
it would come slowly to one
they howled and leaped and spun and made horrid faces but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanitylike yoursthe thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar
ugly
yes it was ugly enough but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which youyou so remote from the night of first agescould comprehend
and why not
the mind of man is capable of anythingbecause everything is in it all the past as well as all the future
what was there after all
joy fear sorrow devotion valour ragewho can tellbut truthtruth stripped of its cloak of time
let the fool gape and shudderthe man knows and can look on without a wink
but he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore
he must meet that truth with his own true stuffwith his own inborn strength
principles won't do
acquisitions clothes pretty ragsrags that would fly off at the first good shake
no you want a deliberate belief
an appeal to me in this fiendish rowis there
very well i hear i admit but i have a voice too and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced
of course a fool what with sheer fright and fine sentiments is always safe
who's that grunting
you wonder i didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance
well noi didn't
fine sentiments you say
fine sentiments be hanged
i had no time
i had to mess about with whitelead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steampipesi tell you
i had to watch the steering and circumvent those snags and get the tinpot along by hook or by crook
there was surfacetruth enough in these things to save a wiser man
and between whiles i had to look after the savage who was fireman
he was an improved specimen he could fire up a vertical boiler
he was there below me and upon my word to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat walking on his hindlegs
a few months of training had done for that really fine chap
he squinted at the steamgauge and at the watergauge with an evident effort of intrepidityand he had filed teeth too the poor devil and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks
he ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank instead of which he was hard at work a thrall to strange witchcraft full of improving knowledge
he was useful because he had been instructed and what he knew was thisthat should the water in that transparent thing disappear the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst and take a terrible vengeance
so he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully with an impromptu charm made of rags tied to his arm and a piece of polished bone as big as a watch stuck flatways through his lower lip while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly the short noise was left behind the interminable miles of silenceand we crept on towards kurtz
but the snags were thick the water was treacherous and shallow the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it and thus neither that fireman nor i had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts
some fifty miles below the inner station we came upon a hut of reeds an inclined and melancholy pole with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it and a neatly stacked woodpile
this was unexpected
we came to the bank and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencilwriting on it
when deciphered it said 'wood for you
hurry up
approach cautiously'
there was a signature but it was illegiblenot kurtza much longer word
'hurry up'
where
up the river
'approach cautiously'
we had not done so
but the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach
something was wrong above
but whatand how much
that was the question
we commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style
the bush around said nothing and would not let us look very far either
a torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut and flapped sadly in our faces
the dwelling was dismantled but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago
there remained a rude tablea plank on two posts a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner and by the door i picked up a book
it had lost its covers and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread which looked clean yet
it was an extraordinary find
its title was an inquiry into some points of seamanship by a man towser towsonsome such namemaster in his majesty's navy
the matter looked dreary reading enough with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures and the copy was sixty years old
i handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness lest it should dissolve in my hands
within towson or towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships' chains and tackle and other such matters
not a very enthralling book but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention an honest concern for the right way of going to work which made these humble pages thought out so many years ago luminous with another than a professional light
the simple old sailor with his talk of chains and purchases made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real
such a book being there was wonderful enough but still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin and plainly referring to the text
i couldn't believe my eyes
they were in cipher
yes it looked like cipher
fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying itand making notesin cipher at that
it was an extravagant mystery
i had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise and when i lifted my eyes i saw the woodpile was gone and the manager aided by all the pilgrims was shouting at me from the riverside
i slipped the book into my pocket
i assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship
i started the lame engine ahead
'it must be this miserable traderthis intruder' exclaimed the manager looking back malevolently at the place we had left
'he must be english' i said
'it will not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful' muttered the manager darkly
i observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world
the current was more rapid now the steamer seemed at her last gasp the sternwheel flopped languidly and i caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat for in sober truth i expected the wretched thing to give up every moment
it was like watching the last flickers of a life
but still we crawled
sometimes i would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards kurtz by but i lost it invariably before we got abreast
to keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience
the manager displayed a beautiful resignation
i fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no i would talk openly with kurtz but before i could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence indeed any action of mine would be a mere futility
what did it matter what any one knew or ignored
what did it matter who was manager
one gets sometimes such a flash of insight
the essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface beyond my reach and beyond my power of meddling
towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from kurtz's station
i wanted to push on but the manager looked grave and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable the sun being very low already to wait where we were till next morning
moreover he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed we must approach in daylightnot at dusk or in the dark
this was sensible enough
eight miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us and i could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach
nevertheless i was annoyed beyond expression at the delay and most unreasonably too since one night more could not matter much after so many months
as we had plenty of wood and caution was the word i brought up in the middle of the stream
the reach was narrow straight with high sides like a railway cutting
the dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set
the current ran smooth and swift but a dumb immobility sat on the banks
the living trees lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth might have been changed into stone even to the slenderest twig to the lightest leaf
it was not sleepit seemed unnatural like a state of trance
not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard
you looked on amazed and began to suspect yourself of being deafthen the night came suddenly and struck you blind as well
about three in the morning some large fish leaped and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired
when the sun rose there was a white fog very warm and clammy and more blinding than the night
it did not shift or drive it was just there standing all round you like something solid
at eight or nine perhaps it lifted as a shutter lifts
we had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees of the immense matted jungle with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over itall perfectly stilland then the white shutter came down again smoothly as if sliding in greased grooves
i ordered the chain which we had begun to heave in to be paid out again
before it stopped running with a muffled rattle a cry a very loud cry as of infinite desolation soared slowly in the opaque air
it ceased
a complaining clamour modulated in savage discords filled our ears
the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap
i don't know how it struck the others to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed so suddenly and apparently from all sides at once did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise
it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking which stopped short leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence
'good god
what is the meaning' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrimsa little fat man with sandy hair and red whiskers who wore sidespring boots and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks
two others remained openmouthed a whole minute then dashed into the little cabin to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances with winchesters at 'ready' in their hands
what we could see was just the steamer we were on her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving and a misty strip of water perhaps two feet broad around herand that was all
the rest of the world was nowhere as far as our eyes and ears were concerned
just nowhere
gone disappeared swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind
i went forward and ordered the chain to be hauled in short so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary
'will they attack'
whispered an awed voice
'we will be all butchered in this fog' murmured another
the faces twitched with the strain the hands trembled slightly the eyes forgot to wink
it was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we though their homes were only eight hundred miles away
the whites of course greatly discomposed had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row
the others had an alert naturally interested expression but their faces were essentially quiet even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain
several exchanged short grunting phrases which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction
their headman a young broadchested black severely draped in darkblue fringed cloths with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets stood near me
'aha'
i said just for good fellowship's sake
'catch 'im' he snapped with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth'catch 'im
give 'im to us'
'to you eh'
i asked 'what would you do with them'
'eat 'im'
he said curtly and leaning his elbow on the rail looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude
i would no doubt have been properly horrified had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past
they had been engaged for six months i don't think a single one of them had any clear idea of time as we at the end of countless ages have
they still belonged to the beginnings of timehad no inherited experience to teach them as it were and of course as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live
certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippomeat which couldn't have lasted very long anyway even if the pilgrims hadn't in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard
it looked like a highhanded proceeding but it was really a case of legitimate selfdefence
you can't breathe dead hippo waking sleeping and eating and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence
besides that they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire each about nine inches long and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages
you can see how that worked
there were either no villages or the people were hostile or the director who like the rest of us fed out of tins with an occasional old hegoat thrown in didn't want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason
so unless they swallowed the wire itself or made loops of it to snare the fishes with i don't see what good their extravagant salary could be to them
i must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company
for the rest the only thing to eatthough it didn't look eatable in the leasti saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like halfcooked dough of a dirty lavender colour they kept wrapped in leaves and now and then swallowed a piece of but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance
why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for usthey were thirty to fiveand have a good tuckin for once amazes me now when i think of it
they were big powerful men with not much capacity to weigh the consequences with courage with strength even yet though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard
and i saw that something restraining one of those human secrets that baffle probability had come into play there
i looked at them with a swift quickening of interestnot because it occurred to me i might be eaten by them before very long though i own to you that just then i perceivedin a new light as it werehow unwholesome the pilgrims looked and i hoped yes i positively hoped that my aspect was not sowhat shall i saysounappetizing a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dreamsensation that pervaded all my days at that time
perhaps i had a little fever too
one can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse
i had often 'a little fever' or a little touch of other thingsthe playful pawstrokes of the wilderness the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course
yes i looked at them as you would on any human being with a curiosity of their impulses motives capacities weaknesses when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity
restraint
what possible restraint
was it superstition disgust patience fearor some kind of primitive honour
no fear can stand up to hunger no patience can wear it out disgust simply does not exist where hunger is and as to superstition beliefs and what you may call principles they are less than chaff in a breeze
don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation its exasperating torment its black thoughts its sombre and brooding ferocity
well i do
it takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly
it's really easier to face bereavement dishonour and the perdition of one's soulthan this kind of prolonged hunger
sad but true
and these chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple
restraint
i would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield
but there was the fact facing methe fact dazzling to be seen like the foam on the depths of the sea like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma a mystery greaterwhen i thought of itthan the curious inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the riverbank behind the blind whiteness of the fog
two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank
'left'
'no no how can you
right right of course'
'it is very serious' said the manager's voice behind me 'i would be desolated if anything should happen to mr kurtz before we came up'
i looked at him and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere
he was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances
that was his restraint
but when he muttered something about going on at once i did not even take the trouble to answer him
i knew and he knew that it was impossible
were we to let go our hold of the bottom we would be absolutely in the airin space
we wouldn't be able to tell where we were going towhether up or down stream or acrosstill we fetched against one bank or the otherand then we wouldn't know at first which it was
of course i made no move
i had no mind for a smashup
you couldn't imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck
whether we drowned at once or not we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another
'i authorize you to take all the risks' he said after a short silence
'i refuse to take any' i said shortly which was just the answer he expected though its tone might have surprised him
'well i must defer to your judgment
you are captain' he said with marked civility
i turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation and looked into the fog
how long would it last
it was the most hopeless lookout
the approach to this kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle
'will they attack do you think'
asked the manager in a confidential tone
i did not think they would attack for several obvious reasons
the thick fog was one
if they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it as we would be if we attempted to move
still i had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrableand yet eyes were in it eyes that had seen us
the riverside bushes were certainly very thick but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable
however during the short lift i had seen no canoes anywhere in the reachcertainly not abreast of the steamer
but what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noiseof the cries we had heard
they had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile intention
unexpected wild and violent as they had been they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow
the glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief
the danger if any i expounded was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose
even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violencebut more generally takes the form of apathy  you should have seen the pilgrims stare
they had no heart to grin or even to revile me but i believe they thought me gone madwith fright maybe
i delivered a regular lecture
my dear boys it was no good bothering
keep a lookout
well you may guess i watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cottonwool
it felt like it toochoking warm stifling
besides all i said though it sounded extravagant was absolutely true to fact
what we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse
the action was very far from being aggressiveit was not even defensive in the usual sense it was undertaken under the stress of desperation and in its essence was purely protective
it developed itself i should say two hours after the fog lifted and its commencement was at a spot roughly speaking about a mile and a half below kurtz's station
we had just floundered and flopped round a bend when i saw an islet a mere grassy hummock of bright green in the middle of the stream
it was the only thing of the kind but as we opened the reach more i perceived it was the head of a long sandbank or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river
they were discoloured just awash and the whole lot was seen just under the water exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin
now as far as i did see i could go to the right or to the left of this
i didn't know either channel of course
the banks looked pretty well alike the depth appeared the same but as i had been informed the station was on the west side i naturally headed for the western passage
no sooner had we fairly entered it than i became aware it was much narrower than i had supposed
to the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal and to the right a high steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes
above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks
the twigs overhung the current thickly and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream
it was then well on in the afternoon the face of the forest was gloomy and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water
in this shadow we steamed upvery slowly as you may imagine
i sheered her well inshorethe water being deepest near the bank as the soundingpole informed me
one of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me
this steamboat was exactly like a decked scow
on the deck there were two little teakwood houses with doors and windows
the boiler was in the foreend and the machinery right astern
over the whole there was a light roof supported on stanchions
the funnel projected through that roof and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilothouse
it contained a couch two campstools a loaded martinihenry leaning in one corner a tiny table and the steeringwheel
it had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side
all these were always thrown open of course
i spent my days perched up there on the extreme foreend of that roof before the door
at night i slept or tried to on the couch
an athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor was the helmsman
he sported a pair of brass earrings wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles and thought all the world of himself
he was the most unstable kind of fool i had ever seen
he steered with no end of a swagger while you were by but if he lost sight of you he became instantly the prey of an abject funk and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute
i was looking down at the soundingpole and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river when i saw my poleman give up on the business suddenly and stretch himself flat on the deck without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in
he kept hold on it though and it trailed in the water
at the same time the fireman whom i could also see below me sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head
i was amazed
then i had to look at the river mighty quick because there was a snag in the fairway
sticks little sticks were flying aboutthick they were whizzing before my nose dropping below me striking behind me against my pilothouse
all this time the river the shore the woods were very quietperfectly quiet
i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the sternwheel and the patter of these things
we cleared the snag clumsily
arrows by jove
we were being shot at
i stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the landside
that foolhelmsman his hands on the spokes was lifting his knees high stamping his feet champing his mouth like a reinedin horse
confound him
and we were staggering within ten feet of the bank
i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter and i saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own looking at me very fierce and steady and then suddenly as though a veil had been removed from my eyes i made out deep in the tangled gloom naked breasts arms legs glaring eyesthe bush was swarming with human limbs in movement glistening of bronze colour
the twigs shook swayed and rustled the arrows flew out of them and then the shutter came to
'steer her straight' i said to the helmsman
he held his head rigid face forward but his eyes rolled he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently his mouth foamed a little
'keep quiet'
i said in a fury
i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind
i darted out
below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck confused exclamations a voice screamed 'can you turn back'
i caught sight of a vshaped ripple on the water ahead
what
another snag
a fusillade burst out under my feet
the pilgrims had opened with their winchesters and were simply squirting lead into that bush
a deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward
i swore at it
now i couldn't see the ripple or the snag either
i stood in the doorway peering and the arrows came in swarms
they might have been poisoned but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat
the bush began to howl
our woodcutters raised a warlike whoop the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me
i glanced over my shoulder and the pilothouse was yet full of noise and smoke when i made a dash at the wheel
the foolnigger had dropped everything to throw the shutter open and let off that martinihenry
he stood before the wide opening glaring and i yelled at him to come back while i straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat
there was no room to turn even if i had wanted to the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke there was no time to lose so i just crowded her into the bankright into the bank where i knew the water was deep
we tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves
the fusillade below stopped short as i had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty
i threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilothouse in at one shutterhole and out at the other
looking past that mad helmsman who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore i saw vague forms of men running bent double leaping gliding distinct incomplete evanescent
something big appeared in the air before the shutter the rifle went overboard and the man stepped back swiftly looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary profound familiar manner and fell upon my feet
the side of his head hit the wheel twice and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little campstool
it looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort
the thin smoke had blown away we were clear of the snag and looking ahead i could see that in another hundred yards or so i would be free to sheer off away from the bank but my feet felt so very warm and wet that i had to look down
the man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me both his hands clutched that cane
it was the shaft of a spear that either thrown or lunged through the opening had caught him in the side just below the ribs the blade had gone in out of sight after making a frightful gash my shoes were full a pool of blood lay very still gleaming darkred under the wheel his eyes shone with an amazing lustre
the fusillade burst out again
he looked at me anxiously gripping the spear like something precious with an air of being afraid i would try to take it away from him
i had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering
with one hand i felt above my head for the line of the steam whistle and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly
the tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth
there was a great commotion in the bush the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out sharplythen silence in which the languid beat of the sternwheel came plainly to my ears
i put the helm hard astarboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas very hot and agitated appeared in the doorway
'the manager sends me' he began in an official tone and stopped short
'good god'
he said glaring at the wounded man
we two whites stood over him and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both
i declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some questions in an understandable language but he died without uttering a sound without moving a limb without twitching a muscle
only in the very last moment as though in response to some sign we could not see to some whisper we could not hear he frowned heavily and that frown gave to his black deathmask an inconceivably sombre brooding and menacing expression
the lustre of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness
'can you steer'
i asked the agent eagerly
he looked very dubious but i made a grab at his arm and he understood at once i meant him to steer whether or no
to tell you the truth i was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks
'he is dead' murmured the fellow immensely impressed
'no doubt about it' said i tugging like mad at the shoelaces
'and by the way i suppose mr kurtz is dead as well by this time'
for the moment that was the dominant thought
there was a sense of extreme disappointment as though i had found out i had been striving after something altogether without a substance
i couldn't have been more disgusted if i had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with mr kurtz
talking with
i flung one shoe overboard and became aware that that was exactly what i had been looking forward toa talk with kurtz
i made the strange discovery that i had never imagined him as doing you know but as discoursing
i didn't say to myself 'now i will never see him' or 'now i will never shake him by the hand' but 'now i will never hear him'
the man presented himself as a voice
not of course that i did not connect him with some sort of action
hadn't i been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected bartered swindled or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together
that was not the point
the point was in his being a gifted creature and that of all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently that carried with it a sense of real presence was his ability to talk his wordsthe gift of expression the bewildering the illuminating the most exalted and the most contemptible the pulsating stream of light or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness
the other shoe went flying unto the devilgod of that river
i thought 'by jove
it's all over
we are too late he has vanishedthe gift has vanished by means of some spear arrow or club
i will never hear that chap speak after all'and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush
i couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation somehow had i been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life why do you sigh in this beastly way somebody
absurd
well absurd
good lord
mustn't a man everhere give me some tobacco
there was a pause of profound stillness then a match flared and marlow's lean face appeared worn hollow with downward folds and dropped eyelids with an aspect of concentrated attention and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame
the match went out
absurd he cried
this is the worst of trying to tell
here you all are each moored with two good addresses like a hulk with two anchors a butcher round one corner a policeman round another excellent appetites and temperature normalyou hearnormal from year's end to year's end
and you say absurd
absurd beexploded
absurd
my dear boys what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes
now i think of it it is amazing i did not shed tears
i am upon the whole proud of my fortitude
i was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted kurtz
of course i was wrong
the privilege was waiting for me
oh yes i heard more than enough
and i was right too
a voice
he was very little more than a voice
and i heardhimitthis voiceother voicesall of them were so little more than voicesand the memory of that time itself lingers around me impalpable like a dying vibration of one immense jabber silly atrocious sordid savage or simply mean without any kind of sense
voices voiceseven the girl herselfnow  he was silent for a long time
i laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie he began suddenly
girl
what
did i mention a girl
oh she is out of itcompletely
theythe women i meanare out of itshould be out of it
we must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own lest ours gets worse
oh she had to be out of it
you should have heard the disinterred body of mr kurtz saying 'my intended'
you would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it
and the lofty frontal bone of mr kurtz
they say the hair goes on growing sometimes but thisahspecimen was impressively bald
the wilderness had patted him on the head and behold it was like a ballan ivory ball it had caressed him andlohe had withered it had taken him loved him embraced him got into his veins consumed his flesh and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation
he was its spoiled and pampered favourite
ivory
i should think so
heaps of it stacks of it
the old mud shanty was bursting with it
you would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below the ground in the whole country
'mostly fossil' the manager had remarked disparagingly
it was no more fossil than i am but they call it fossil when it is dug up
it appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimesbut evidently they couldn't bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted mr kurtz from his fate
we filled the steamboat with it and had to pile a lot on the deck
thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last
you should have heard him say 'my ivory'
oh yes i heard him
'my intended my ivory my station my river my' everything belonged to him
it made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places
everything belonged to himbut that was a trifle
the thing was to know what he belonged to how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own
that was the reflection that made you creepy all over
it was impossibleit was not good for one eithertrying to imagine
he had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the landi mean literally
you can't understand
how could youwith solid pavement under your feet surrounded by kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylumshow can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man's untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitudeutter solitude without a policemanby the way of silenceutter silence where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion
these little things make all the great difference
when they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength upon your own capacity for faithfulness
of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrongtoo dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness
i take it no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil the fool is too much of a fool or the devil too much of a devili don't know which
or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds
then the earth for you is only a standing placeand whether to be like this is your loss or your gain i won't pretend to say
but most of us are neither one nor the other
the earth for us is a place to live in where we must put up with sights with sounds with smells too by jovebreathe dead hippo so to speak and not be contaminated
and there don't you see
your strength comes in the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff inyour power of devotion not to yourself but to an obscure backbreaking business
and that's difficult enough
mind i am not trying to excuse or even explaini am trying to account to myself forformr kurtzfor the shade of mr kurtz
this initiated wraith from the back of nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether
this was because it could speak english to me
the original kurtz had been educated partly in england andas he was good enough to say himselfhis sympathies were in the right place
his mother was halfenglish his father was halffrench
all europe contributed to the making of kurtz and by and by i learned that most appropriately the international society for the suppression of savage customs had intrusted him with the making of a report for its future guidance
and he had written it too
i've seen it
i've read it
it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence but too highstrung i think
seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for
but this must have been before hislet us saynerves went wrong and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites whichas far as i reluctantly gathered from what i heard at various timeswere offered up to himdo you understandto mr kurtz himself
but it was a beautiful piece of writing
the opening paragraph however in the light of later information strikes me now as ominous
he began with the argument that we whites from the point of development we had arrived at 'must necessarily appear to them savages in the nature of supernatural beingswe approach them with the might of a deity' and so on and so on
'by the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded' etc etc
from that point he soared and took me with him
the peroration was magnificent though difficult to remember you know
it gave me the notion of an exotic immensity ruled by an august benevolence
it made me tingle with enthusiasm
this was the unbounded power of eloquenceof wordsof burning noble words
there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of a method
it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying like a flash of lightning in a serene sky 'exterminate all the brutes'
the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet' he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career
i had full information about all these things and besides as it turned out i was to have the care of his memory
i've done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it if i choose for an everlasting rest in the dustbin of progress amongst all the sweepings and figuratively speaking all the dead cats of civilization
but then you see i can't choose
he won't be forgotten
whatever he was he was not common
he had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witchdance in his honour he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings he had one devoted friend at least and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with selfseeking
no i can't forget him though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him
i missed my late helmsman awfullyi missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilothouse
perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black sahara
well don't you see he had done something he had steered for months i had him at my backa helpan instrument
it was a kind of partnership
he steered for mei had to look after him i worried about his deficiencies and thus a subtle bond had been created of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken
and the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memorylike a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment
poor fool
if he had only left that shutter alone
he had no restraint no restraintjust like kurtza tree swayed by the wind
as soon as i had put on a dry pair of slippers i dragged him out after first jerking the spear out of his side which operation i confess i performed with my eyes shut tight
his heels leaped together over the little doorstep his shoulders were pressed to my breast i hugged him from behind desperately
oh
he was heavy heavy heavier than any man on earth i should imagine
then without more ado i tipped him overboard
the current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass and i saw the body roll over twice before i lost sight of it for ever
all the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awningdeck about the pilothouse chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude
what they wanted to keep that body hanging about for i can't guess
embalm it maybe
but i had also heard another and a very ominous murmur on the deck below
my friends the woodcutters were likewise scandalized and with a better show of reasonthough i admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible
oh quite
i had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten the fishes alone should have him
he had been a very secondrate helmsman while alive but now he was dead he might have become a firstclass temptation and possibly cause some startling trouble
besides i was anxious to take the wheel the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business
this i did directly the simple funeral was over
we were going halfspeed keeping right in the middle of the stream and i listened to the talk about me
they had given up kurtz they had given up the station kurtz was dead and the station had been burntand so onand so on
the redhaired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor kurtz had been properly avenged
'say
we must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush
eh
what do you think
say'
he positively danced the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar
and he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man
i could not help saying 'you made a glorious lot of smoke anyhow'
i had seen from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew that almost all the shots had gone too high
you can't hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut
the retreat i maintainedand i was rightwas caused by the screeching of the steam whistle
upon this they forgot kurtz and began to howl at me with indignant protests
the manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events when i saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines of some sort of building
'what's this'
i asked
he clapped his hands in wonder
'the station'
he cried
i edged in at once still going halfspeed
through my glasses i saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth
a long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar the jungle and the woods made a background
there was no enclosure or fence of any kind but there had been one apparently for near the house halfadozen slim posts remained in a row roughly trimmed and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls
the rails or whatever there had been between had disappeared
of course the forest surrounded all that
the riverbank was clear and on the waterside i saw a white man under a hat like a cartwheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm
examining the edge of the forest above and below i was almost certain i could see movementshuman forms gliding here and there
i steamed past prudently then stopped the engines and let her drift down
the man on the shore began to shout urging us to land
'we have been attacked' screamed the manager
'i knowi know
it's all right' yelled back the other as cheerful as you please
'come along
it's all right
i am glad'
his aspect reminded me of something i had seensomething funny i had seen somewhere
as i manoeuvred to get alongside i was asking myself 'what does this fellow look like'
suddenly i got it
he looked like a harlequin
his clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably but it was covered with patches all over with bright patches blue red and yellowpatches on the back patches on the front patches on elbows on knees coloured binding around his jacket scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done
a beardless boyish face very fair no features to speak of nose peeling little blue eyes smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain
'look out captain'
he cried 'there's a snag lodged in here last night'
what
another snag
i confess i swore shamefully
i had nearly holed my cripple to finish off that charming trip
the harlequin on the bank turned his little pugnose up to me
'you english'
he asked all smiles
'are you'
i shouted from the wheel
the smiles vanished and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment
then he brightened up
'never mind'
he cried encouragingly
'are we in time'
i asked
'he is up there' he replied with a toss of the head up the hill and becoming gloomy all of a sudden
his face was like the autumn sky overcast one moment and bright the next
when the manager escorted by the pilgrims all of them armed to the teeth had gone to the house this chap came on board
'i say i don't like this
these natives are in the bush' i said
he assured me earnestly it was all right
'they are simple people' he added 'well i am glad you came
it took me all my time to keep them off'
'but you said it was all right' i cried
'oh they meant no harm' he said and as i stared he corrected himself 'not exactly'
then vivaciously 'my faith your pilothouse wants a cleanup'
in the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble
'one good screech will do more for you than all your rifles
they are simple people' he repeated
he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me
he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case
'don't you talk with mr
kurtz'
i said
'you don't talk with that manyou listen to him' he exclaimed with severe exaltation
'but now' he waved his arm and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency
in a moment he came up again with a jump possessed himself of both my hands shook them continuously while he gabbled 'brother sailor honour pleasure delight introduce myself russian son of an archpriest government of tambov what
tobacco
english tobacco the excellent english tobacco
now that's brotherly
smoke
where's a sailor that does not smoke  the pipe soothed him and gradually i made out he had run away from school had gone to sea in a russian ship ran away again served some time in english ships was now reconciled with the archpriest
he made a point of that
'but when one is young one must see things gather experience ideas enlarge the mind'
'here'
i interrupted
'you can never tell
here i met mr kurtz' he said youthfully solemn and reproachful
i held my tongue after that
it appears he had persuaded a dutch tradinghouse on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby
he had been wandering about that river for nearly two years alone cut off from everybody and everything
'i am not so young as i look
i am twentyfive' he said
'at first old van shuyten would tell me to go to the devil' he narrated with keen enjoyment 'but i stuck to him and talked and talked till at last he got afraid i would talk the hindleg off his favourite dog so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns and told me he hoped he would never see my face again
good old dutchman van shuyten
i've sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago so that he can't call me a little thief when i get back
i hope he got it
and for the rest i don't care
i had some wood stacked for you
that was my old house
did you see'
i gave him towson's book
he made as though he would kiss me but restrained himself
'the only book i had left and i thought i had lost it' he said looking at it ecstatically
'so many accidents happen to a man going about alone you know
canoes get upset sometimesand sometimes you've got to clear out so quick when the people get angry'
he thumbed the pages
'you made notes in russian'
i asked
he nodded
'i thought they were written in cipher' i said
he laughed then became serious
'i had lots of trouble to keep these people off' he said
'did they want to kill you'
i asked
'oh no'
he cried and checked himself
'why did they attack us'
i pursued
he hesitated then said shamefacedly 'they don't want him to go'
'don't they'
i said curiously
he nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom
'i tell you' he cried 'this man has enlarged my mind'
he opened his arms wide staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round     iii    i looked at him lost in astonishment
there he was before me in motley as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes enthusiastic fabulous
his very existence was improbable inexplicable and altogether bewildering
he was an insoluble problem
it was inconceivable how he had existed how he had succeeded in getting so far how he had managed to remainwhy he did not instantly disappear
'i went a little farther' he said 'then still a little farthertill i had gone so far that i don't know how i'll ever get back
never mind
plenty time
i can manage
you take kurtz away quickquicki tell you'
the glamour of youth enveloped his particoloured rags his destitution his loneliness the essential desolation of his futile wanderings
for monthsfor yearshis life hadn't been worth a day's purchase and there he was gallantly thoughtlessly alive to all appearances indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting audacity
i was seduced into something like admirationlike envy
glamour urged him on glamour kept him unscathed
he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through
his need was to exist and to move onwards at the greatest possible risk and with a maximum of privation
if the absolutely pure uncalculating unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being it ruled this bepatched youth
i almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame
it seemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely that even while he was talking to you you forgot that it was hethe man before your eyeswho had gone through these things
i did not envy him his devotion to kurtz though
he had not meditated over it
it came to him and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism
i must say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far
they had come together unavoidably like two ships becalmed near each other and lay rubbing sides at last
i suppose kurtz wanted an audience because on a certain occasion when encamped in the forest they had talked all night or more probably kurtz had talked
'we talked of everything' he said quite transported at the recollection
'i forgot there was such a thing as sleep
the night did not seem to last an hour
everything
everything
of love too'
'ah he talked to you of love'
i said much amused
'it isn't what you think' he cried almost passionately
'it was in general
he made me see thingsthings'
he threw his arms up
we were on deck at the time and the headman of my woodcutters lounging near by turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes
i looked around and i don't know why but i assure you that never never before did this land this river this jungle the very arch of this blazing sky appear to me so hopeless and so dark so impenetrable to human thought so pitiless to human weakness
'and ever since you have been with him of course'
i said
on the contrary
it appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes
he had as he informed me proudly managed to nurse kurtz through two illnesses he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat but as a rule kurtz wandered alone far in the depths of the forest
'very often coming to this station i had to wait days and days before he would turn up' he said
'ah it was worth waiting forsometimes'
'what was he doing
exploring or what'
i asked
'oh yes of course' he had discovered lots of villages a lake toohe did not know exactly in what direction it was dangerous to inquire too muchbut mostly his expeditions had been for ivory
'but he had no goods to trade with by that time' i objected
'there's a good lot of cartridges left even yet' he answered looking away
'to speak plainly he raided the country' i said
he nodded
'not alone surely'
he muttered something about the villages round that lake
'kurtz got the tribe to follow him did he'
i suggested
he fidgeted a little
'they adored him' he said
the tone of these words was so extraordinary that i looked at him searchingly
it was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of kurtz
the man filled his life occupied his thoughts swayed his emotions
'what can you expect'
he burst out 'he came to them with thunder and lightning you knowand they had never seen anything like itand very terrible
he could be very terrible
you can't judge mr kurtz as you would an ordinary man
no no no
nowjust to give you an ideai don't mind telling you he wanted to shoot me too one daybut i don't judge him'
'shoot you'
i cried 'what for'
'well i had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me
you see i used to shoot game for them
well he wanted it and wouldn't hear reason
he declared he would shoot me unless i gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country because he could do so and had a fancy for it and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased
and it was true too
i gave him the ivory
what did i care
but i didn't clear out
no no
i couldn't leave him
i had to be careful of course till we got friendly again for a time
he had his second illness then
afterwards i had to keep out of the way but i didn't mind
he was living for the most part in those villages on the lake
when he came down to the river sometimes he would take to me and sometimes it was better for me to be careful
this man suffered too much
he hated all this and somehow he couldn't get away
when i had a chance i begged him to try and leave while there was time i offered to go back with him
and he would say yes and then he would remain go off on another ivory hunt disappear for weeks forget himself amongst these peopleforget himselfyou know'
'why
he's mad' i said
he protested indignantly
mr kurtz couldn't be mad
if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldn't dare hint at such a thing
i had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was looking at the shore sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house
the consciousness of there being people in that bush so silent so quietas silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hillmade me uneasy
there was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations completed by shrugs in interrupted phrases in hints ending in deep sighs
the woods were unmoved like a maskheavy like the closed door of a prisonthey looked with their air of hidden knowledge of patient expectation of unapproachable silence
the russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that mr kurtz had come down to the river bringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe
he had been absent for several monthsgetting himself adored i supposeand had come down unexpectedly with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream
evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of thewhat shall i sayless material aspirations
however he had got much worse suddenly
'i heard he was lying helpless and so i came uptook my chance' said the russian
'oh he is bad very bad'
i directed my glass to the house
there were no signs of life but there was the ruined roof the long mud wall peeping above the grass with three little square windowholes no two of the same size all this brought within reach of my hand as it were
and then i made a brusque movement and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass
you remember i told you i had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place
now i had suddenly a nearer view and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow
then i went carefully from post to post with my glass and i saw my mistake
these round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic they were expressive and puzzling striking and disturbingfood for thought and also for vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole
they would have been even more impressive those heads on the stakes if their faces had not been turned to the house
only one the first i had made out was facing my way
i was not so shocked as you may think
the start back i had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise
i had expected to see a knob of wood there you know
i returned deliberately to the first i had seenand there it was black dried sunken with closed eyelidsa head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole and with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth was smiling too smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber
i am not disclosing any trade secrets
in fact the manager said afterwards that mr kurtz's methods had ruined the district
i have no opinion on that point but i want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there
they only showed that mr kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts that there was something wanting in himsome small matter which when the pressing need arose could not be found under his magnificent eloquence
whether he knew of this deficiency himself i can't say
i think the knowledge came to him at lastonly at the very last
but the wilderness had found him out early and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion
i think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitudeand the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating
it echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core
i put down the glass and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance
the admirer of mr kurtz was a bit crestfallen
in a hurried indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take thesesay symbolsdown
he was not afraid of the natives they would not stir till mr kurtz gave the word
his ascendancy was extraordinary
the camps of these people surrounded the place and the chiefs came every day to see him
they would crawl 'i don't want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching mr kurtz' i shouted
curious this feeling that came over me that such details would be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under mr kurtz's windows
after all that was only a savage sight while i seemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors where pure uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief being something that had a right to existobviouslyin the sunshine
the young man looked at me with surprise
i suppose it did not occur to him that mr kurtz was no idol of mine
he forgot i hadn't heard any of these splendid monologues on what was it
on love justice conduct of lifeor what not
if it had come to crawling before mr kurtz he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all
i had no idea of the conditions he said these heads were the heads of rebels
i shocked him excessively by laughing
rebels
what would be the next definition i was to hear
there had been enemies criminals workersand these were rebels
those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks
'you don't know how such a life tries a man like kurtz' cried kurtz's last disciple
'well and you'
i said
'i
i
i am a simple man
i have no great thoughts
i want nothing from anybody
how can you compare me to'
his feelings were too much for speech and suddenly he broke down
'i don't understand' he groaned
'i've been doing my best to keep him alive and that's enough
i had no hand in all this
i have no abilities
there hasn't been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here
he was shamefully abandoned
a man like this with such ideas
shamefully
shamefully
iihaven't slept for the last ten nights'  his voice lost itself in the calm of the evening
the long shadows of the forest had slipped downhill while we talked had gone far beyond the ruined hovel beyond the symbolic row of stakes
all this was in the gloom while we down there were yet in the sunshine and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendour with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below
not a living soul was seen on the shore
the bushes did not rustle
suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared as though they had come up from the ground
they waded waistdeep in the grass in a compact body bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst
instantly in the emptiness of the landscape a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land and as if by enchantment streams of human beingsof naked human beingswith spears in their hands with bows with shields with wild glances and savage movements were poured into the clearing by the darkfaced and pensive forest
the bushes shook the grass swayed for a time and then everything stood still in attentive immobility
'now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for' said the russian at my elbow
the knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too halfway to the steamer as if petrified
i saw the man on the stretcher sit up lank and with an uplifted arm above the shoulders of the bearers
'let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time' i said
i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring necessity
i could not hear a sound but through my glasses i saw the thin arm extended commandingly the lower jaw moving the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks
kurtzkurtzthat means short in germandon't it
well the name was as true as everything else in his lifeand death
he looked at least seven feet long
his covering had fallen off and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a windingsheet
i could see the cage of his ribs all astir the bones of his arm waving
it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze
i saw him open his mouth wideit gave him a weirdly voracious aspect as though he had wanted to swallow all the air all the earth all the men before him
a deep voice reached me faintly
he must have been shouting
he fell back suddenly
the stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again and almost at the same time i noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration
some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his armstwo shotguns a heavy rifle and a light revolvercarbinethe thunderbolts of that pitiful jupiter
the manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head
they laid him down in one of the little cabinsjust a room for a bed place and a campstool or two you know
we had brought his belated correspondence and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed
his hand roamed feebly amongst these papers
i was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of his expression
it was not so much the exhaustion of disease
he did not seem in pain
this shadow looked satiated and calm as though for the moment it had had its fill of all the emotions
he rustled one of the letters and looking straight in my face said 'i am glad'
somebody had been writing to him about me
these special recommendations were turning up again
the volume of tone he emitted without effort almost without the trouble of moving his lips amazed me
a voice
a voice
it was grave profound vibrating while the man did not seem capable of a whisper
however he had enough strength in himfactitious no doubtto very nearly make an end of us as you shall hear directly
the manager appeared silently in the doorway i stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me
the russian eyed curiously by the pilgrims was staring at the shore
i followed the direction of his glance
dark human shapes could be made out in the distance flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest and near the river two bronze figures leaning on tall spears stood in the sunlight under fantastic headdresses of spotted skins warlike and still in statuesque repose
and from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman
she walked with measured steps draped in striped and fringed cloths treading the earth proudly with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments
she carried her head high her hair was done in the shape of a helmet she had brass leggings to the knee brass wire gauntlets to the elbow a crimson spot on her tawny cheek innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck bizarre things charms gifts of witchmen that hung about her glittered and trembled at every step
she must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her
she was savage and superb wildeyed and magnificent there was something ominous and stately in her deliberate progress
and in the hush that had fallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land the immense wilderness the colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her pensive as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul
she came abreast of the steamer stood still and faced us
her long shadow fell to the water's edge
her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling halfshaped resolve
she stood looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose
a whole minute passed and then she made a step forward
there was a low jingle a glint of yellow metal a sway of fringed draperies and she stopped as if her heart had failed her
the young fellow by my side growled
the pilgrims murmured at my back
she looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her glance
suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head as though in an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the earth swept around on the river gathering the steamer into a shadowy embrace
a formidable silence hung over the scene
she turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into the bushes to the left
once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared
'if she had offered to come aboard i really think i would have tried to shoot her' said the man of patches nervously
'i have been risking my life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house
she got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags i picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with
i wasn't decent
at least it must have been that for she talked like a fury to kurtz for an hour pointing at me now and then
i don't understand the dialect of this tribe
luckily for me i fancy kurtz felt too ill that day to care or there would have been mischief
i don't understand noit's too much for me
ah well it's all over now'
at this moment i heard kurtz's deep voice behind the curtain 'save mesave the ivory you mean
don't tell me
save me why i've had to save you
you are interrupting my plans now
sick
sick
not so sick as you would like to believe
never mind
i'll carry my ideas out yeti will return
i'll show you what can be done
you with your little peddling notionsyou are interfering with me
i will return
i'  the manager came out
he did me the honour to take me under the arm and lead me aside
'he is very low very low' he said
he considered it necessary to sigh but neglected to be consistently sorrowful
'we have done all we could for himhaven't we
but there is no disguising the fact mr kurtz has done more harm than good to the company
he did not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action
cautiously cautiouslythat's my principle
we must be cautious yet
the district is closed to us for a time
deplorable
upon the whole the trade will suffer
i don't deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivorymostly fossil
we must save it at all eventsbut look how precarious the position isand why
because the method is unsound'
'do you' said i looking at the shore 'call it unsound method' 'without doubt' he exclaimed hotly
'don't you'
'no method at all' i murmured after a while
'exactly' he exulted
'i anticipated this
shows a complete want of judgment
it is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter'
'oh' said i 'that fellowwhat's his namethe brickmaker will make a readable report for you'
he appeared confounded for a moment
it seemed to me i had never breathed an atmosphere so vile and i turned mentally to kurtz for reliefpositively for relief
'nevertheless i think mr kurtz is a remarkable man' i said with emphasis
he started dropped on me a heavy glance said very quietly 'he was' and turned his back on me
my hour of favour was over i found myself lumped along with kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe i was unsound
ah
but it was something to have at least a choice of nightmares
i had turned to the wilderness really not to mr kurtz who i was ready to admit was as good as buried
and for a moment it seemed to me as if i also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets
i felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast the smell of the damp earth the unseen presence of victorious corruption the darkness of an impenetrable night
the russian tapped me on the shoulder
i heard him mumbling and stammering something about 'brother seamancouldn't concealknowledge of matters that would affect mr kurtz's reputation'
i waited
for him evidently mr kurtz was not in his grave i suspect that for him mr kurtz was one of the immortals
'well'
said i at last 'speak out
as it happens i am mr kurtz's friendin a way'
he stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been 'of the same profession' he would have kept the matter to himself without regard to consequences
'he suspected there was an active illwill towards him on the part of these white men that' 'you are right' i said remembering a certain conversation i had overheard
'the manager thinks you ought to be hanged'
he showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at first
'i had better get out of the way quietly' he said earnestly
'i can do no more for kurtz now and they would soon find some excuse
what's to stop them
there's a military post three hundred miles from here'
'well upon my word' said i 'perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by'
'plenty' he said
'they are simple peopleand i want nothing you know'
he stood biting his lip then 'i don't want any harm to happen to these whites here but of course i was thinking of mr kurtz's reputationbut you are a brother seaman and' 'all right' said i after a time
'mr
kurtz's reputation is safe with me'
i did not know how truly i spoke
he informed me lowering his voice that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer
'he hated sometimes the idea of being taken awayand then again
but i don't understand these matters
i am a simple man
he thought it would scare you awaythat you would give it up thinking him dead
i could not stop him
oh i had an awful time of it this last month'
'very well' i said
'he is all right now'
'yeees' he muttered not very convinced apparently
'thanks' said i 'i shall keep my eyes open'
'but quieteh'
he urged anxiously
'it would be awful for his reputation if anybody here' i promised a complete discretion with great gravity
'i have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far
i am off
could you give me a few martinihenry cartridges'
i could and did with proper secrecy
he helped himself with a wink at me to a handful of my tobacco
'between sailorsyou knowgood english tobacco'
at the door of the pilothouse he turned round'i say haven't you a pair of shoes you could spare'
he raised one leg
'look'
the soles were tied with knotted strings sandalwise under his bare feet
i rooted out an old pair at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm
one of his pockets bright red was bulging with cartridges from the other dark blue peeped 'towson's inquiry' etc etc
he seemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness
'ah
i'll never never meet such a man again
you ought to have heard him recite poetryhis own too it was he told me
poetry'
he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights
'oh he enlarged my mind'
'goodbye' said i
he shook hands and vanished in the night
sometimes i ask myself whether i had ever really seen himwhether it was possible to meet such a phenomenon
when i woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed in the starred darkness real enough to make me get up for the purpose of having a look round
on the hill a big fire burned illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the stationhouse
one of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks armed for the purpose was keeping guard over the ivory but deep within the forest red gleams that wavered that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness showed the exact position of the camp where mr kurtz's adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil
the monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration
a steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive and had a strange narcotic effect upon my halfawake senses
i believe i dozed off leaning over the rail till an abrupt burst of yells an overwhelming outbreak of a pentup and mysterious frenzy woke me up in a bewildered wonder
it was cut short all at once and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence
i glanced casually into the little cabin
a light was burning within but mr kurtz was not there
i think i would have raised an outcry if i had believed my eyes
but i didn't believe them at firstthe thing seemed so impossible
the fact is i was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright pure abstract terror unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger
what made this emotion so overpowering washow shall i define itthe moral shock i received as if something altogether monstrous intolerable to thought and odious to the soul had been thrust upon me unexpectedly
this lasted of course the merest fraction of a second and then the usual sense of commonplace deadly danger the possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre or something of the kind which i saw impending was positively welcome and composing
it pacified me in fact so much that i did not raise an alarm
there was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of me
the yells had not awakened him he snored very slightly i left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore
i did not betray mr kurtzit was ordered i should never betray himit was written i should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice
i was anxious to deal with this shadow by myself aloneand to this day i don't know why i was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar blackness of that experience
as soon as i got on the bank i saw a traila broad trail through the grass
i remember the exultation with which i said to myself 'he can't walkhe is crawling on allfoursi've got him'
the grass was wet with dew
i strode rapidly with clenched fists
i fancy i had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing
i don't know
i had some imbecile thoughts
the knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair
i saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of winchesters held to the hip
i thought i would never get back to the steamer and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age
such silly thingsyou know
and i remember i confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart and was pleased at its calm regularity
i kept to the track thoughthen stopped to listen
the night was very clear a dark blue space sparkling with dew and starlight in which black things stood very still
i thought i could see a kind of motion ahead of me
i was strangely cocksure of everything that night
i actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle i verily believe chuckling to myself so as to get in front of that stir of that motion i had seenif indeed i had seen anything
i was circumventing kurtz as though it had been a boyish game
i came upon him and if he had not heard me coming i would have fallen over him too but he got up in time
he rose unsteady long pale indistinct like a vapour exhaled by the earth and swayed slightly misty and silent before me while at my back the fires loomed between the trees and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest
i had cut him off cleverly but when actually confronting him i seemed to come to my senses i saw the danger in its right proportion
it was by no means over yet
suppose he began to shout
though he could hardly stand there was still plenty of vigour in his voice
'go awayhide yourself' he said in that profound tone
it was very awful
i glanced back
we were within thirty yards from the nearest fire
a black figure stood up strode on long black legs waving long black arms across the glow
it had hornsantelope horns i thinkon its head
some sorcerer some witchman no doubt it looked fiendlike enough
'do you know what you are doing'
i whispered
'perfectly' he answered raising his voice for that single word it sounded to me far off and yet loud like a hail through a speakingtrumpet
'if he makes a row we are lost' i thought to myself
this clearly was not a case for fisticuffs even apart from the very natural aversion i had to beat that shadowthis wandering and tormented thing
'you will be lost' i said'utterly lost'
one gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration you know
i did say the right thing though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment when the foundations of our intimacy were being laidto endureto endureeven to the endeven beyond
'i had immense plans' he muttered irresolutely
'yes' said i 'but if you try to shout i'll smash your head with' there was not a stick or a stone near
'i will throttle you for good' i corrected myself
'i was on the threshold of great things' he pleaded in a voice of longing with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold
'and now for this stupid scoundrel' 'your success in europe is assured in any case' i affirmed steadily
i did not want to have the throttling of him you understandand indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose
i tried to break the spellthe heavy mute spell of the wildernessthat seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions
this alone i was convinced had driven him out to the edge of the forest to the bush towards the gleam of fires the throb of drums the drone of weird incantations this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations
and don't you see the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the headthough i had a very lively sense of that danger toobut in this that i had to deal with a being to whom i could not appeal in the name of anything high or low
i had even like the niggers to invoke himhimselfhis own exalted and incredible degradation
there was nothing either above or below him and i knew it
he had kicked himself loose of the earth
confound the man
he had kicked the very earth to pieces
he was alone and i before him did not know whether i stood on the ground or floated in the air
i've been telling you what we saidrepeating the phrases we pronouncedbut what's the good
they were common everyday wordsthe familiar vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life
but what of that
they had behind them to my mind the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams of phrases spoken in nightmares
soul
if anybody ever struggled with a soul i am the man
and i wasn't arguing with a lunatic either
believe me or not his intelligence was perfectly clearconcentrated it is true upon himself with horrible intensity yet clear and therein was my only chancebarring of course the killing him there and then which wasn't so good on account of unavoidable noise
but his soul was mad
being alone in the wilderness it had looked within itself and by heavens
i tell you it had gone mad
i hadfor my sins i supposeto go through the ordeal of looking into it myself
no eloquence could have been so withering to one's belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity
he struggled with himself too
i saw iti heard it
i saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint no faith and no fear yet struggling blindly with itself
i kept my head pretty well but when i had him at last stretched on the couch i wiped my forehead while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my back down that hill
and yet i had only supported him his bony arm clasped round my neckand he was not much heavier than a child
when next day we left at noon the crowd of whose presence behind the curtain of trees i had been acutely conscious all the time flowed out of the woods again filled the clearing covered the slope with a mass of naked breathing quivering bronze bodies
i steamed up a bit then swung down stream and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing thumping fierce riverdemon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air
in front of the first rank along the river three men plastered with bright red earth from head to foot strutted to and fro restlessly
when we came abreast again they faced the river stamped their feet nodded their horned heads swayed their scarlet bodies they shook towards the fierce riverdemon a bunch of black feathers a mangy skin with a pendent tailsomething that looked a dried gourd they shouted periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language and the deep murmurs of the crowd interrupted suddenly were like the responses of some satanic litany
we had carried kurtz into the pilothouse there was more air there
lying on the couch he stared through the open shutter
there was an eddy in the mass of human bodies and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream
she put out her hands shouted something and all that wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of articulated rapid breathless utterance
'do you understand this'
i asked
he kept on looking out past me with fiery longing eyes with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate
he made no answer but i saw a smile a smile of indefinable meaning appear on his colourless lips that a moment after twitched convulsively
'do i not'
he said slowly gasping as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural power
i pulled the string of the whistle and i did this because i saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark
at the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged mass of bodies
'don't
don't you frighten them away' cried some one on deck disconsolately
i pulled the string time after time
they broke and ran they leaped they crouched they swerved they dodged the flying terror of the sound
the three red chaps had fallen flat face down on the shore as though they had been shot dead
only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and glittering river
and then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun and i could see nothing more for smoke
the brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress and kurtz's life was running swiftly too ebbing ebbing out of his heart into the sea of inexorable time
the manager was very placid he had no vital anxieties now he took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance the 'affair' had come off as well as could be wished
i saw the time approaching when i would be left alone of the party of 'unsound method'
the pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour
i was so to speak numbered with the dead
it is strange how i accepted this unforeseen partnership this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms
kurtz discoursed
a voice
a voice
it rang deep to the very last
it survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness of his heart
oh he struggled
he struggled
the wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images nowimages of wealth and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression
my intended my station my career my ideasthese were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments
the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow sham whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould of primeval earth
but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions avid of lying fame of sham distinction of all the appearances of success and power
sometimes he was contemptibly childish
he desired to have kings meet him at railwaystations on his return from some ghastly nowhere where he intended to accomplish great things
'you show them you have in you something that is really profitable and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your ability' he would say
'of course you must take care of the motivesright motivesalways'
the long reaches that were like one and the same reach monotonous bends that were exactly alike slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world the forerunner of change of conquest of trade of massacres of blessings
i looked aheadpiloting
'close the shutter' said kurtz suddenly one day 'i can't bear to look at this'
i did so
there was a silence
'oh but i will wring your heart yet'
he cried at the invisible wilderness
we broke downas i had expectedand had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island
this delay was the first thing that shook kurtz's confidence
one morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photographthe lot tied together with a shoestring
'keep this for me' he said
'this noxious fool' meaning the manager 'is capable of prying into my boxes when i am not looking'
in the afternoon i saw him
he was lying on his back with closed eyes and i withdrew quietly but i heard him mutter 'live rightly die die' i listened
there was nothing more
was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article
he had been writing for the papers and meant to do so again 'for the furthering of my ideas
it's a duty'
his was an impenetrable darkness
i looked at him as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines
but i had not much time to give him because i was helping the enginedriver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders to straighten a bent connectingrod and in other such matters
i lived in an infernal mess of rust filings nuts bolts spanners hammers ratchetdrillsthings i abominate because i don't get on with them
i tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard i toiled wearily in a wretched scrapheapunless i had the shakes too bad to stand
one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously 'i am lying here in the dark waiting for death'
the light was within a foot of his eyes
i forced myself to murmur 'oh nonsense'
and stood over him as if transfixed
anything approaching the change that came over his features i have never seen before and hope never to see again
oh i wasn't touched
i was fascinated
it was as though a veil had been rent
i saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride of ruthless power of craven terrorof an intense and hopeless despair
did he live his life again in every detail of desire temptation and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge
he cried in a whisper at some image at some visionhe cried out twice a cry that was no more than a breath  'the horror
the horror'
i blew the candle out and left the cabin
the pilgrims were dining in the messroom and i took my place opposite the manager who lifted his eyes to give me a questioning glance which i successfully ignored
he leaned back serene with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness
a continuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp upon the cloth upon our hands and faces
suddenly the manager's boy put his insolent black head in the doorway and said in a tone of scathing contempt  'mistah kurtzhe dead'
all the pilgrims rushed out to see
i remained and went on with my dinner
i believe i was considered brutally callous
however i did not eat much
there was a lamp in therelight don't you knowand outside it was so beastly beastly dark
i went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth
the voice was gone
what else had been there
but i am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole
and then they very nearly buried me
however as you see i did not go to join kurtz there and then
i did not
i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end and to show my loyalty to kurtz once more
destiny
my destiny
droll thing life isthat mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose
the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourselfthat comes too latea crop of unextinguishable regrets
i have wrestled with death
it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine
it takes place in an impalpable greyness with nothing underfoot with nothing around without spectators without clamour without glory without the great desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a sickly atmosphere of tepid scepticism without much belief in your own right and still less in that of your adversary
if such is the form of ultimate wisdom then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be
i was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say
this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man
he had something to say
he said it
since i had peeped over the edge myself i understand better the meaning of his stare that could not see the flame of the candle but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness
he had summed uphe had judged
'the horror'
he was a remarkable man
after all this was the expression of some sort of belief it had candour it had conviction it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truththe strange commingling of desire and hate
and it is not my own extremity i remember besta vision of greyness without form filled with physical pain and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all thingseven of this pain itself
no
it is his extremity that i seem to have lived through
true he had made that last stride he had stepped over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot
and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible
perhaps
i like to think my summingup would not have been a word of careless contempt
better his crymuch better
it was an affirmation a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats by abominable terrors by abominable satisfactions
but it was a victory
that is why i have remained loyal to kurtz to the last and even beyond when a long time after i heard once more not his own voice but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal
no they did not bury me though there is a period of time which i remember mistily with a shuddering wonder like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire
i found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other to devour their infamous cookery to gulp their unwholesome beer to dream their insignificant and silly dreams
they trespassed upon my thoughts
they were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence because i felt so sure they could not possibly know the things i knew
their bearing which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend
i had no particular desire to enlighten them but i had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance
i daresay i was not very well at that time
i tottered about the streetsthere were various affairs to settlegrinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons
i admit my behaviour was inexcusable but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days
my dear aunt's endeavours to 'nurse up my strength' seemed altogether beside the mark
it was not my strength that wanted nursing it was my imagination that wanted soothing
i kept the bundle of papers given me by kurtz not knowing exactly what to do with it
his mother had died lately watched over as i was told by his intended
a cleanshaved man with an official manner and wearing goldrimmed spectacles called on me one day and made inquiries at first circuitous afterwards suavely pressing about what he was pleased to denominate certain 'documents'
i was not surprised because i had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there
i had refused to give up the smallest scrap out of that package and i took the same attitude with the spectacled man
he became darkly menacing at last and with much heat argued that the company had the right to every bit of information about its 'territories'
and said he 'mr
kurtz's knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiarowing to his great abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed therefore' i assured him mr kurtz's knowledge however extensive did not bear upon the problems of commerce or administration
he invoked then the name of science
'it would be an incalculable loss if' etc etc
i offered him the report on the 'suppression of savage customs' with the postscriptum torn off
he took it up eagerly but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt
'this is not what we had a right to expect' he remarked
'expect nothing else' i said
'there are only private letters'
he withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings and i saw him no more but another fellow calling himself kurtz's cousin appeared two days later and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative's last moments
incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been essentially a great musician
'there was the making of an immense success' said the man who was an organist i believe with lank grey hair flowing over a greasy coatcollar
i had no reason to doubt his statement and to this day i am unable to say what was kurtz's profession whether he ever had anywhich was the greatest of his talents
i had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers or else for a journalist who could paintbut even the cousin who took snuff during the interview could not tell me what he had beenexactly
he was a universal geniuson that point i agreed with the old chap who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agitation bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance
ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his 'dear colleague' turned up
this visitor informed me kurtz's proper sphere ought to have been politics 'on the popular side'
he had furry straight eyebrows bristly hair cropped short an eyeglass on a broad ribbon and becoming expansive confessed his opinion that kurtz really couldn't write a bit'but heavens
how that man could talk
he electrified large meetings
he had faithdon't you seehe had the faith
he could get himself to believe anythinganything
he would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party'
'what party'
i asked
'any party' answered the other
'he was ananextremist'
did i not think so
i assented
did i know he asked with a sudden flash of curiosity 'what it was that had induced him to go out there'
'yes' said i and forthwith handed him the famous report for publication if he thought fit
he glanced through it hurriedly mumbling all the time judged 'it would do' and took himself off with this plunder
thus i was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl's portrait
she struck me as beautifuli mean she had a beautiful expression
i know that the sunlight can be made to lie too yet one felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features
she seemed ready to listen without mental reservation without suspicion without a thought for herself
i concluded i would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself
curiosity
yes and also some other feeling perhaps
all that had been kurtz's had passed out of my hands his soul his body his station his plans his ivory his career
there remained only his memory and his intendedand i wanted to give that up too to the past in a wayto surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate
i don't defend myself
i had no clear perception of what it was i really wanted
perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty or the fulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence
i don't know
i can't tell
but i went
i thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every man's lifea vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage but before the high and ponderous door between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a wellkept alley in a cemetery i had a vision of him on the stretcher opening his mouth voraciously as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind
he lived then before me he lived as much as he had ever liveda shadow insatiable of splendid appearances of frightful realities a shadow darker than the shadow of the night and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence
the vision seemed to enter the house with methe stretcher the phantombearers the wild crowd of obedient worshippers the gloom of the forests the glitter of the reach between the murky bends the beat of the drum regular and muffled like the beating of a heartthe heart of a conquering darkness
it was a moment of triumph for the wilderness an invading and vengeful rush which it seemed to me i would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul
and the memory of what i had heard him say afar there with the horned shapes stirring at my back in the glow of fires within the patient woods those broken phrases came back to me were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity
i remembered his abject pleading his abject threats the colossal scale of his vile desires the meanness the torment the tempestuous anguish of his soul
and later on i seemed to see his collected languid manner when he said one day 'this lot of ivory now is really mine
the company did not pay for it
i collected it myself at a very great personal risk
i am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though
h'm
it is a difficult case
what do you think i ought to doresist
eh
i want no more than justice'
he wanted no more than justiceno more than justice
i rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor and while i waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panelstare with that wide and immense stare embracing condemning loathing all the universe
i seemed to hear the whispered cry the horror
the horror  the dusk was falling
i had to wait in a lofty drawingroom with three long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped columns
the bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct curves
the tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness
a grand piano stood massively in a corner with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a sombre and polished sarcophagus
a high door openedclosed
i rose
she came forward all in black with a pale head floating towards me in the dusk
she was in mourning
it was more than a year since his death more than a year since the news came she seemed as though she would remember and mourn forever
she took both my hands in hers and murmured 'i had heard you were coming'
i noticed she was not very youngi mean not girlish
she had a mature capacity for fidelity for belief for suffering
the room seemed to have grown darker as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead
this fair hair this pale visage this pure brow seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me
their glance was guileless profound confident and trustful
she carried her sorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow as though she would say 'ii alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves'
but while we were still shaking hands such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that i perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of time
for her he had died only yesterday
and by jove
the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died only yesterdaynay this very minute
i saw her and him in the same instant of timehis death and her sorrowi saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death
do you understand
i saw them togetheri heard them together
she had said with a deep catch of the breath 'i have survived' while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly mingled with her tone of despairing regret the summing up whisper of his eternal condemnation
i asked myself what i was doing there with a sensation of panic in my heart as though i had blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold
she motioned me to a chair
we sat down
i laid the packet gently on the little table and she put her hand over it 'you knew him well' she murmured after a moment of mourning silence
'intimacy grows quickly out there' i said
'i knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another'
'and you admired him' she said
'it was impossible to know him and not to admire him
was it'
'he was a remarkable man' i said unsteadily
then before the appealing fixity of her gaze that seemed to watch for more words on my lips i went on 'it was impossible not to'  'love him' she finished eagerly silencing me into an appalled dumbness
'how true
how true
but when you think that no one knew him so well as i
i had all his noble confidence
i knew him best'
'you knew him best' i repeated
and perhaps she did
but with every word spoken the room was growing darker and only her forehead smooth and white remained illumined by the inextinguishable light of belief and love
'you were his friend' she went on
'his friend' she repeated a little louder
'you must have been if he had given you this and sent you to me
i feel i can speak to youand oh
i must speak
i want youyou who have heard his last wordsto know i have been worthy of him
it is not pride
yes
i am proud to know i understood him better than any one on earthhe told me so himself
and since his mother died i have had no oneno onetoto'  i listened
the darkness deepened
i was not even sure whether he had given me the right bundle
i rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of his papers which after his death i saw the manager examining under the lamp
and the girl talked easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy she talked as thirsty men drink
i had heard that her engagement with kurtz had been disapproved by her people
he wasn't rich enough or something
and indeed i don't know whether he had not been a pauper all his life
he had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there
' who was not his friend who had heard him speak once'
she was saying
'he drew men towards him by what was best in them'
she looked at me with intensity
'it is the gift of the great' she went on and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds full of mystery desolation and sorrow i had ever heardthe ripple of the river the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind the murmurs of the crowds the faint ring of incomprehensible words cried from afar the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness
'but you have heard him
you know'
she cried
'yes i know' i said with something like despair in my heart but bowing my head before the faith that was in her before that great and saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness in the triumphant darkness from which i could not have defended herfrom which i could not even defend myself
'what a loss to meto us'
she corrected herself with beautiful generosity then added in a murmur 'to the world'
by the last gleams of twilight i could see the glitter of her eyes full of tearsof tears that would not fall
'i have been very happyvery fortunatevery proud' she went on
'too fortunate
too happy for a little while
and now i am unhappy forfor life'
she stood up her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a glimmer of gold
i rose too
'and of all this' she went on mournfully 'of all his promise and of all his greatness of his generous mind of his noble heart nothing remainsnothing but a memory
you and i'  'we shall always remember him' i said hastily
'no'
she cried
'it is impossible that all this should be lostthat such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothingbut sorrow
you know what vast plans he had
i knew of them tooi could not perhaps understandbut others knew of them
something must remain
his words at least have not died'
'his words will remain' i said
'and his example' she whispered to herself
'men looked up to himhis goodness shone in every act
his example'  'true' i said 'his example too
yes his example
i forgot that'
'but i do not
i cannoti cannot believenot yet
i cannot believe that i shall never see him again that nobody will see him again never never never'
she put out her arms as if after a retreating figure stretching them back and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of the window
never see him
i saw him clearly enough then
i shall see this eloquent phantom as long as i live and i shall see her too a tragic and familiar shade resembling in this gesture another one tragic also and bedecked with powerless charms stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream the stream of darkness
she said suddenly very low 'he died as he lived'
'his end' said i with dull anger stirring in me 'was in every way worthy of his life'
'and i was not with him' she murmured
my anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity
'everything that could be done' i mumbled
'ah but i believed in him more than any one on earthmore than his own mother more thanhimself
he needed me
me
i would have treasured every sigh every word every sign every glance'
i felt like a chill grip on my chest
'don't' i said in a muffled voice
'forgive me
ii have mourned so long in silencein silence you were with himto the last
i think of his loneliness
nobody near to understand him as i would have understood
perhaps no one to hear'  'to the very end' i said shakily
'i heard his very last words' i stopped in a fright
'repeat them' she murmured in a heartbroken tone
'i wanti wantsomethingsomethingtoto live with'
i was on the point of crying at her 'don't you hear them'
the dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind
'the horror
the horror'
'his last wordto live with' she insisted
'don't you understand i loved himi loved himi loved him'
i pulled myself together and spoke slowly
'the last word he pronounced wasyour name'
i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain
'i knew iti was sure'
she knew
she was sure
i heard her weeping she had hidden her face in her hands
it seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape that the heavens would fall upon my head
but nothing happened
the heavens do not fall for such a trifle
would they have fallen i wonder if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due
hadn't he said he wanted only justice
but i couldn't
i could not tell her
it would have been too darktoo dark altogether  marlow ceased and sat apart indistinct and silent in the pose of a meditating buddha
nobody moved for a time
we have lost the first of the ebb said the director suddenly
i raised my head
the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast skyseemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
chapter i   mr verloc going out in the morning left his shop nominally in charge of his brotherinlaw
it could be done because there was very little business at any time and practically none at all before the evening
mr verloc cared but little about his ostensible business
and moreover his wife was in charge of his brotherinlaw
the shop was small and so was the house
it was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon london
the shop was a square box of a place with the front glazed in small panes
in the daytime the door remained closed in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar
the window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines closed yellow paper envelopes very flimsy and marked twoandsix in heavy black figures a few numbers of ancient french comic publications hung across a string as if to dry a dingy blue china bowl a casket of black wood bottles of marking ink and rubber stamps a few books with titles hinting at impropriety a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers badly printed with titles like the torch the gongrousing titles
and the two gas jets inside the panes were always turned low either for economys sake or for the sake of the customers
these customers were either very young men who hung about the window for a time before slipping in suddenly or men of a more mature age but looking generally as if they were not in funds
some of that last kind had the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches and traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments which had the appearance of being much worn and not very valuable
and the legs inside them did not as a general rule seem of much account either
with their hands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats they dodged in sideways one shoulder first as if afraid to start the bell going
the bell hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel was difficult to circumvent
it was hopelessly cracked but of an evening at the slightest provocation it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence
it clattered and at that signal through the dusty glass door behind the painted deal counter mr verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at the back
his eyes were naturally heavy he had an air of having wallowed fully dressed all day on an unmade bed
another man would have felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage
in a commercial transaction of the retail order much depends on the sellers engaging and amiable aspect
but mr verloc knew his business and remained undisturbed by any sort of sthetic doubt about his appearance
with a firm steadyeyed impudence which seemed to hold back the threat of some abominable menace he would proceed to sell over the counter some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in the transaction a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside for instance or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes or a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title
now and then it happened that one of the faded yellow dancing girls would get sold to an amateur as though she had been alive and young
sometimes it was mrs verloc who would appear at the call of the cracked bell
winnie verloc was a young woman with a full bust in a tight bodice and with broad hips
her hair was very tidy
steadyeyed like her husband she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the counter
then the customer of comparatively tender years would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman and with rage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle of marking ink retail value sixpence price in verlocs shop oneandsixpence which once outside he would drop stealthily into the gutter
the evening visitorsthe men with collars turned up and soft hats rammed downnodded familiarly to mrs verloc and with a muttered greeting lifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the back parlour which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs
the door of the shop was the only means of entrance to the house in which mr verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares exercised his vocation of a protector of society and cultivated his domestic virtues
these last were pronounced
he was thoroughly domesticated
neither his spiritual nor his mental nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much abroad
he found at home the ease of his body and the peace of his conscience together with mrs verlocs wifely attentions and mrs verlocs mothers deferential regard
winnies mother was a stout wheezy woman with a large brown face
she wore a black wig under a white cap
her swollen legs rendered her inactive
she considered herself to be of french descent which might have been true and after a good many years of married life with a licensed victualler of the more common sort she provided for the years of widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near vauxhall bridge road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the district of belgravia
this topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind
such as they were her daughter winnie helped to look after them
traces of the french descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in winnie too
they were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair
winnie had also other charms her youth her full rounded form her clear complexion the provocation of her unfathomable reserve which never went so far as to prevent conversation carried on on the lodgers part with animation and on hers with an equable amiability
it must be that mr verloc was susceptible to these fascinations
mr verloc was an intermittent patron
he came and went without any very apparent reason
he generally arrived in london like the influenza from the continent only he arrived unheralded by the press and his visitations set in with great severity
he breakfasted in bed and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every dayand sometimes even to a later hour
but when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the belgravian square
he left it late and returned to it earlyas early as three or four in the morning and on waking up at ten addressed winnie bringing in the breakfast tray with jocular exhausted civility in the hoarse failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together
his prominent heavylidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and languidly the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter
in winnies mothers opinion mr verloc was a very nice gentleman
from her lifes experience gathered in various business houses the good woman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by the patrons of privatesaloon bars
mr verloc approached that ideal he attained it in fact
of course well take over your furniture mother winnie had remarked
the lodginghouse was to be given up
it seems it would not answer to carry it on
it would have been too much trouble for mr verloc
it would not have been convenient for his other business
what his business was he did not say but after his engagement to winnie he took the trouble to get up before noon and descending the basement stairs make himself pleasant to winnies mother in the breakfastroom downstairs where she had her motionless being
he stroked the cat poked the fire had his lunch served to him there
he left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance but all the same remained out till the night was far advanced
he never offered to take winnie to theatres as such a nice gentleman ought to have done
his evenings were occupied
his work was in a way political he told winnie once
she would have he warned her to be very nice to his political friends
and with her straight unfathomable glance she answered that she would be so of course
how much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for winnies mother to discover
the married couple took her over with the furniture
the mean aspect of the shop surprised her
the change from the belgravian square to the narrow street in soho affected her legs adversely
they became of an enormous size
on the other hand she experienced a complete relief from material cares
her soninlaws heavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety
her daughters future was obviously assured and even as to her son stevie she need have no anxiety
she had not been able to conceal from herself that he was a terrible encumbrance that poor stevie
but in view of winnies fondness for her delicate brother and of mr verlocs kind and generous disposition she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this rough world
and in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased that the verlocs had no children
as that circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to mr verloc and as winnie found an object of quasimaternal affection in her brother perhaps this was just as well for poor stevie
for he was difficult to dispose of that boy
he was delicate and in a frail way goodlooking too except for the vacant droop of his lower lip
under our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned to read and write notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip
but as errandboy he did not turn out a great success
he forgot his messages he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts by the comedies of the streets which he contemplated openmouthed to the detriment of his employers interests or by the dramas of fallen horses whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle
when led away by a grave and protecting policeman it would often become apparent that poor stevie had forgotten his addressat least for a time
a brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation
when startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly
however he never had any fits which was encouraging and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always in his childhoods days run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister winnie
on the other hand he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness
when he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father an agent for a foreign preserved milk firm having given him an opening as officeboy he was discovered one foggy afternoon in his chiefs absence busy letting off fireworks on the staircase
he touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets angry catherine wheels loudly exploding squibsand the matter might have turned out very serious
an awful panic spread through the whole building
wildeyed choking clerks stampeded through the passages full of smoke silk hats and elderly business men could be seen rolling independently down the stairs
stevie did not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had done
his motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover
it was only later on that winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession
it seems that two other officeboys in the building had worked upon his feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy
but his fathers friend of course dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business
after that altruistic exploit stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the belgravian mansion
there was obviously no future in such work
the gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then
mr verloc showed himself the most generous of lodgers
but altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects so that when winnie announced her engagement to mr verloc her mother could not help wondering with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery what would become of poor stephen now
it appeared that mr verloc was ready to take him over together with his wifes mother and with the furniture which was the whole visible fortune of the family
mr verloc gathered everything as it came to his broad goodnatured breast
the furniture was disposed to the best advantage all over the house but mrs verlocs mother was confined to two back rooms on the first floor
the luckless stevie slept in one of them
by this time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come to blur like a golden mist the sharp line of his small lower jaw
he helped his sister with blind love and docility in her household duties
mr verloc thought that some occupation would be good for him
his spare time he occupied by drawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of paper
he applied himself to that pastime with great industry with his elbows spread out and bowed low over the kitchen table
through the open door of the parlour at the back of the shop winnie his sister glanced at him from time to time with maternal vigilance
chapter ii   such was the house the household and the business mr verloc left behind him on his way westward at the hour of halfpast ten in the morning
it was unusually early for him his whole person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned his boots were shiny his cheeks freshly shaven had a sort of gloss and even his heavylidded eyes refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber sent out glances of comparative alertness
through the park railings these glances beheld men and women riding in the row couples cantering past harmoniously others advancing sedately at a walk loitering groups of three or four solitary horsemen looking unsociable and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tightfitting coat
carriages went bowling by mostly twohorse broughams with here and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a womans face and hat emerging above the folded hood
and a peculiarly london sunagainst which nothing could be said except that it looked bloodshotglorified all this by its stare
it hung at a moderate elevation above hyde park corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance
the very pavement under mr verlocs feet had an oldgold tinge in that diffused light in which neither wall nor tree nor beast nor man cast a shadow
mr verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold
there were red coppery gleams on the roofs of houses on the corners of walls on the panels of carriages on the very coats of the horses and on the broad back of mr verlocs overcoat where they produced a dull effect of rustiness
but mr verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty
he surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the towns opulence and luxury with an approving eye
all these people had to be protected
protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury
they had to be protected and their horses carriages houses servants had to be protected and the source of their wealth had to be protected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour
it had toand mr verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion
his idleness was not hygienic but it suited him very well
he was in a manner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism or perhaps rather with a fanatical inertness
born of industrious parents for a life of toil he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a mans preference for one particular woman in a given thousand
he was too lazy even for a mere demagogue for a workman orator for a leader of labour
it was too much trouble
he required a more perfect form of ease or it might have been that he was the victim of a philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort
such a form of indolence requires implies a certain amount of intelligence
mr verloc was not devoid of intelligenceand at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that sign of scepticism
his big prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking
they were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic effect
undemonstrative and burly in a fatpig style mr verloc without either rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his thoughts proceeded on his way
he trod the pavement heavily with his shiny boots and his general getup was that of a welltodo mechanic in business for himself
he might have been anything from a pictureframe maker to a locksmith an employer of labour in a small way
but there was also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could have acquired in the practice of his handicraft however dishonestly exercised the air common to men who live on the vices the follies or the baser fears of mankind the air of moral nihilism common to keepers of gambling hells and disorderly houses to private detectives and inquiry agents to drink sellers and i should say to the sellers of invigorating electric belts and to the inventors of patent medicines
but of that last i am not sure not having carried my investigations so far into the depths
for all i know the expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic
i shouldnt be surprised
what i want to affirm is that mr verlocs expression was by no means diabolic
before reaching knightsbridge mr verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans in the almost silent swift flow of hansoms
under his hat worn with a slight backward tilt his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness for his business was with an embassy
and mr verloc steady like a rocka soft kind of rockmarched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private
in its breadth emptiness and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature of matter that never dies
the only reminder of mortality was a doctors brougham arrested in august solitude close to the curbstone
the polished knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the eye could reach the clean windows shone with a dark opaque lustre
and all was still
but a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective a butcher boy driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at olympic games dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels
a guiltylooking cat issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of mr verloc then dived into another basement and a thick police constable looking a stranger to every emotion as if he too were part of inorganic nature surging apparently out of a lamppost took not the slightest notice of mr verloc
with a turn to the left mr verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a yellow wall which for some inscrutable reason had no
 chesham square written on it in black letters
chesham square was at least sixty yards away and mr verloc cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by londons topographical mysteries held on steadily without a sign of surprise or indignation
at last with businesslike persistency he reached the square and made diagonally for the number 
this belonged to an imposing carriage gate in a high clean wall between two houses of which one rationally enough bore the number  and the other was numbered  but the fact that this last belonged to porthill street a street well known in the neighbourhood was proclaimed by an inscription placed above the groundfloor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of keeping track of londons strayed houses
why powers are not asked of parliament a short act would do for compelling those edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration
mr verloc did not trouble his head about it his mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism not its perfectionment or even its criticism
it was so early that the porter of the embassy issued hurriedly out of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat
his waistcoat was red and he wore kneebreeches but his aspect was flustered
mr verloc aware of the rush on his flank drove it off by simply holding out an envelope stamped with the arms of the embassy and passed on
he produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened the door and stood back to let him enter the hall
a clear fire burned in a tall fireplace and an elderly man standing with his back to it in evening dress and with a chain round his neck glanced up from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before his calm and severe face
he didnt move but another lackey in brown trousers and clawhammer coat edged with thin yellow cord approaching mr verloc listened to the murmur of his name and turning round on his heel in silence began to walk without looking back once
mr verloc thus led along a groundfloor passage to the left of the great carpeted staircase was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy writingtable and a few chairs
the servant shut the door and mr verloc remained alone
he did not take a seat
with his hat and stick held in one hand he glanced about passing his other podgy hand over his uncovered sleek head
another door opened noiselessly and mr verloc immobilising his glance in that direction saw at first only black clothes the bald top of a head and a drooping dark grey whisker on each side of a pair of wrinkled hands
the person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before his eyes and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step turning the papers over the while
privy councillor wurmt chancelier dambassade was rather shortsighted
this meritorious official laying the papers on the table disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine long dark grey hairs barred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows
he put on a blackframed pincenez upon a blunt and shapeless nose and seemed struck by mr verlocs appearance
under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses
he made no sign of greeting neither did mr verloc who certainly knew his place but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of mr verlocs spine under the vast surface of his overcoat
the effect was of unobtrusive deference
i have here some of your reports said the bureaucrat in an unexpectedly soft and weary voice and pressing the tip of his forefinger on the papers with force
he paused and mr verloc who had recognised his own handwriting very well waited in an almost breathless silence
we are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police here the other continued with every appearance of mental fatigue
the shoulders of mr verloc without actually moving suggested a shrug
and for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips opened
every country has its police he said philosophically
but as the official of the embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt constrained to add allow me to observe that i have no means of action upon the police here  what is desired said the man of papers is the occurrence of something definite which should stimulate their vigilance
that is within your provinceis it not so  mr verloc made no answer except by a sigh which escaped him involuntarily for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful expression
the official blinked doubtfully as if affected by the dim light of the room
he repeated vaguely
the vigilance of the policeand the severity of the magistrates
the general leniency of the judicial procedure here and the utter absence of all repressive measures are a scandal to europe
what is wished for just now is the accentuation of the unrestof the fermentation which undoubtedly exists  undoubtedly undoubtedly broke in mr verloc in a deep deferential bass of an oratorical quality so utterly different from the tone in which he had spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised
it exists to a dangerous degree
my reports for the last twelve months make it sufficiently clear  your reports for the last twelve months state councillor wurmt began in his gentle and dispassionate tone have been read by me
i failed to discover why you wrote them at all  a sad silence reigned for a time
mr verloc seemed to have swallowed his tongue and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly
at last he gave them a slight push
the state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first condition of your employment
what is required at present is not writing but the bringing to light of a distinct significant facti would almost say of an alarming fact  i need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end mr verloc said with convinced modulations in his conversational husky tone
but the sense of being blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter of these eyeglasses on the other side of the table disconcerted him
he stopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion
the useful hardworking if obscure member of the embassy had an air of being impressed by some newlyborn thought
you are very corpulent he said
this observation really of a psychological nature and advanced with the modest hesitation of an officeman more familiar with ink and paper than with the requirements of active life stung mr verloc in the manner of a rude personal remark
he stepped back a pace
eh
what were you pleased to say he exclaimed with husky resentment
the chancelier dambassade entrusted with the conduct of this interview seemed to find it too much for him
i think he said that you had better see mr vladimir
yes decidedly i think you ought to see mr vladimir
be good enough to wait here he added and went out with mincing steps
at once mr verloc passed his hand over his hair
a slight perspiration had broken out on his forehead
he let the air escape from his pursedup lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup
but when the servant in brown appeared at the door silently mr verloc had not moved an inch from the place he had occupied throughout the interview
he had remained motionless as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls
he walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gasjet then up a flight of winding stairs and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the first floor
the footman threw open a door and stood aside
the feet of mr verloc felt a thick carpet
the room was large with three windows and a young man with a shaven big face sitting in a roomy armchair before a vast mahogany writingtable said in french to the chancelier dambassade who was going out with the papers in his hand  you are quite right mon cher
hes fatthe animal  mr vladimir first secretary had a drawingroom reputation as an agreeable and entertaining man
he was something of a favourite in society
his wit consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of his seat with his left hand raised as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the thumb and forefinger while his round and cleanshaven face wore an expression of merry perplexity
but there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked at mr verloc
lying far back in the deep armchair with squarely spread elbows and throwing one leg over a thick knee he had with his smooth and rosy countenance the air of a preternaturally thriving baby that will not stand nonsense from anybody
you understand french i suppose he said
mr verloc stated huskily that he did
his whole vast bulk had a forward inclination
he stood on the carpet in the middle of the room clutching his hat and stick in one hand the other hung lifelessly by his side
he muttered unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about having done his military service in the french artillery
at once with contemptuous perversity mr vladimir changed the language and began to speak idiomatic english without the slightest trace of a foreign accent
ah
yes
of course
lets see
how much did you get for obtaining the design of the improved breechblock of their new fieldgun  five years rigorous confinement in a fortress mr verloc answered unexpectedly but without any sign of feeling
you got off easily was mr vladimirs comment
and anyhow it served you right for letting yourself get caught
what made you go in for that sort of thingeh  mr verlocs husky conversational voice was heard speaking of youth of a fatal infatuation for an unworthy  aha
cherchez la femme mr vladimir deigned to interrupt unbending but without affability there was on the contrary a touch of grimness in his condescension
how long have you been employed by the embassy here he asked
ever since the time of the late baron stottwartenheim mr verloc answered in subdued tones and protruding his lips sadly in sign of sorrow for the deceased diplomat
the first secretary observed this play of physiognomy steadily
ah
ever since
well
what have you got to say for yourself he asked sharply
mr verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of having anything special to say
he had been summoned by a letterand he plunged his hand busily into the side pocket of his overcoat but before the mocking cynical watchfulness of mr vladimir concluded to leave it there
bah said that latter
what do you mean by getting out of condition like this
you havent got even the physique of your profession
youa member of a starving proletariatnever
youa desperate socialist or anarchistwhich is it  anarchist stated mr verloc in a deadened tone
bosh went on mr vladimir without raising his voice
you startled old wurmt himself
you wouldnt deceive an idiot
they all are that bytheby but you seem to me simply impossible
so you began your connection with us by stealing the french gun designs
and you got yourself caught
that must have been very disagreeable to our government
you dont seem to be very smart  mr verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily
as ive had occasion to observe before a fatal infatuation for an unworthy  mr vladimir raised a large white plump hand
ah yes
the unlucky attachmentof your youth
she got hold of the money and then sold you to the policeeh  the doleful change in mr verlocs physiognomy the momentary drooping of his whole person confessed that such was the regrettable case
mr vladimirs hand clasped the ankle reposing on his knee
the sock was of dark blue silk
you see that was not very clever of you
perhaps you are too susceptible  mr verloc intimated in a throaty veiled murmur that he was no longer young
oh
thats a failing which age does not cure mr vladimir remarked with sinister familiarity
but no
you are too fat for that
you could not have come to look like this if you had been at all susceptible
ill tell you what i think is the matter you are a lazy fellow
how long have you been drawing pay from this embassy  eleven years was the answer after a moment of sulky hesitation
ive been charged with several missions to london while his excellency baron stottwartenheim was still ambassador in paris
then by his excellencys instructions i settled down in london
i am english  you are
are you
eh  a naturalborn british subject mr verloc said stolidly
but my father was french and so  never mind explaining interrupted the other
i daresay you could have been legally a marshal of france and a member of parliament in englandand then indeed you would have been of some use to our embassy  this flight of fancy provoked something like a faint smile on mr verlocs face
mr vladimir retained an imperturbable gravity
but as ive said you are a lazy fellow you dont use your opportunities
in the time of baron stottwartenheim we had a lot of softheaded people running this embassy
they caused fellows of your sort to form a false conception of the nature of a secret service fund
it is my business to correct this misapprehension by telling you what the secret service is not
it is not a philanthropic institution
ive had you called here on purpose to tell you this  mr vladimir observed the forced expression of bewilderment on verlocs face and smiled sarcastically
i see that you understand me perfectly
i daresay you are intelligent enough for your work
what we want now is activityactivity  on repeating this last word mr vladimir laid a long white forefinger on the edge of the desk
every trace of huskiness disappeared from verlocs voice
the nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar of his overcoat
his lips quivered before they came widely open
if youll only be good enough to look up my record he boomed out in his great clear oratorical bass youll see i gave a warning only three months ago on the occasion of the grand duke romualds visit to paris which was telegraphed from here to the french police and  tut tut broke out mr vladimir with a frowning grimace
the french police had no use for your warning
dont roar like this
what the devil do you mean  with a note of proud humility mr verloc apologised for forgetting himself
his voicefamous for years at openair meetings and at workmens assemblies in large halls had contributed he said to his reputation of a good and trustworthy comrade
it was therefore a part of his usefulness
it had inspired confidence in his principles
i was always put up to speak by the leaders at a critical moment mr verloc declared with obvious satisfaction
there was no uproar above which he could not make himself heard he added and suddenly he made a demonstration
allow me he said
with lowered forehead without looking up swiftly and ponderously he crossed the room to one of the french windows
as if giving way to an uncontrollable impulse he opened it a little
mr vladimir jumping up amazed from the depths of the armchair looked over his shoulder and below across the courtyard of the embassy well beyond the open gate could be seen the broad back of a policeman watching idly the gorgeous perambulator of a wealthy baby being wheeled in state across the square
constable said mr verloc with no more effort than if he were whispering and mr vladimir burst into a laugh on seeing the policeman spin round as if prodded by a sharp instrument
mr verloc shut the window quietly and returned to the middle of the room
with a voice like that he said putting on the husky conversational pedal i was naturally trusted
and i knew what to say too  mr vladimir arranging his cravat observed him in the glass over the mantelpiece
i daresay you have the social revolutionary jargon by heart well enough he said contemptuously
vox et
  you havent ever studied latinhave you  no growled mr verloc
you did not expect me to know it
i belong to the million
who knows latin
only a few hundred imbeciles who arent fit to take care of themselves  for some thirty seconds longer mr vladimir studied in the mirror the fleshy profile the gross bulk of the man behind him
and at the same time he had the advantage of seeing his own face cleanshaved and round rosy about the gills and with the thin sensitive lips formed exactly for the utterance of those delicate witticisms which had made him such a favourite in the very highest society
then he turned and advanced into the room with such determination that the very ends of his quaintly oldfashioned bow necktie seemed to bristle with unspeakable menaces
the movement was so swift and fierce that mr verloc casting an oblique glance quailed inwardly
aha
you dare be impudent mr vladimir began with an amazingly guttural intonation not only utterly unenglish but absolutely uneuropean and startling even to mr verlocs experience of cosmopolitan slums
you dare
well i am going to speak plain english to you
voice wont do
we have no use for your voice
we dont want a voice
we want factsstartling factsdamn you he added with a sort of ferocious discretion right into mr verlocs face
dont you try to come over me with your hyperborean manners mr verloc defended himself huskily looking at the carpet
at this his interlocutor smiling mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie switched the conversation into french
you give yourself for an agent provocateur  the proper business of an agent provocateur is to provoke
as far as i can judge from your record kept here you have done nothing to earn your money for the last three years  nothing exclaimed verloc stirring not a limb and not raising his eyes but with the note of sincere feeling in his tone
i have several times prevented what might have been  there is a proverb in this country which says prevention is better than cure interrupted mr vladimir throwing himself into the armchair
it is stupid in a general way
there is no end to prevention
but it is characteristic
they dislike finality in this country
dont you be too english
and in this particular instance dont be absurd
the evil is already here
we dont want preventionwe want cure  he paused turned to the desk and turning over some papers lying there spoke in a changed businesslike tone without looking at mr verloc
you know of course of the international conference assembled in milan  mr verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of reading the daily papers
to a further question his answer was that of course he understood what he read
at this mr vladimir smiling faintly at the documents he was still scanning one after another murmured as long as it is not written in latin i suppose  or chinese added mr verloc stolidly
hm
some of your revolutionary friends effusions are written in a charabia every bit as incomprehensible as chinese  mr vladimir let fall disdainfully a grey sheet of printed matter
what are all these leaflets headed f p with a hammer pen and torch crossed
what does it mean this f p  mr verloc approached the imposing writingtable
the future of the proletariat
its a society he explained standing ponderously by the side of the armchair not anarchist in principle but open to all shades of revolutionary opinion  are you in it  one of the vicepresidents mr verloc breathed out heavily and the first secretary of the embassy raised his head to look at him
then you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said incisively
isnt your society capable of anything else but printing this prophetic bosh in blunt type on this filthy paper eh
why dont you do something
look here
ive this matter in hand now and i tell you plainly that you will have to earn your money
the good old stottwartenheim times are over
no work no pay  mr verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout legs
he stepped back one pace and blew his nose loudly
he was in truth startled and alarmed
the rusty london sunshine struggling clear of the london mist shed a lukewarm brightness into the first secretarys private room and in the silence mr verloc heard against a windowpane the faint buzzing of a flyhis first fly of the yearheralding better than any number of swallows the approach of spring
the useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected unpleasantly this big man threatened in his indolence
in the pause mr vladimir formulated in his mind a series of disparaging remarks concerning mr verlocs face and figure
the fellow was unexpectedly vulgar heavy and impudently unintelligent
he looked uncommonly like a master plumber come to present his bill
the first secretary of the embassy from his occasional excursions into the field of american humour had formed a special notion of that class of mechanic as the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and incompetency
this was then the famous and trusty secret agent so secret that he was never designated otherwise but by the symbol delta in the late baron stottwartenheims official semiofficial and confidential correspondence the celebrated agent delta whose warnings had the power to change the schemes and the dates of royal imperial grand ducal journeys and sometimes caused them to be put off altogether
this fellow
and mr vladimir indulged mentally in an enormous and derisive fit of merriment partly at his own astonishment which he judged naive but mostly at the expense of the universally regretted baron stottwartenheim
his late excellency whom the august favour of his imperial master had imposed as ambassador upon several reluctant ministers of foreign affairs had enjoyed in his lifetime a fame for an owlish pessimistic gullibility
his excellency had the social revolution on the brain
he imagined himself to be a diplomatist set apart by a special dispensation to watch the end of diplomacy and pretty nearly the end of the world in a horrid democratic upheaval
his prophetic and doleful despatches had been for years the joke of foreign offices
he was said to have exclaimed on his deathbed visited by his imperial friend and master unhappy europe
thou shalt perish by the moral insanity of thy children  he was fated to be the victim of the first humbugging rascal that came along thought mr vladimir smiling vaguely at mr verloc
you ought to venerate the memory of baron stottwartenheim he exclaimed suddenly
the lowered physiognomy of mr verloc expressed a sombre and weary annoyance
permit me to observe to you he said that i came here because i was summoned by a peremptory letter
i have been here only twice before in the last eleven years and certainly never at eleven in the morning
it isnt very wise to call me up like this
there is just a chance of being seen
and that would be no joke for me  mr vladimir shrugged his shoulders
it would destroy my usefulness continued the other hotly
thats your affair murmured mr vladimir with soft brutality
when you cease to be useful you shall cease to be employed
yes
right off
cut short
you shall mr vladimir frowning paused at a loss for a sufficiently idiomatic expression and instantly brightened up with a grin of beautifully white teeth
you shall be chucked he brought out ferociously
once more mr verloc had to react with all the force of his will against that sensation of faintness running down ones legs which once upon a time had inspired some poor devil with the felicitous expression my heart went down into my boots  mr verloc aware of the sensation raised his head bravely
mr vladimir bore the look of heavy inquiry with perfect serenity
what we want is to administer a tonic to the conference in milan he said airily
its deliberations upon international action for the suppression of political crime dont seem to get anywhere
england lags
this country is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual liberty
its intolerable to think that all your friends have got only to come over to  in that way i have them all under my eye mr verloc interrupted huskily
it would be much more to the point to have them all under lock and key
england must be brought into line
the imbecile bourgeoisie of this country make themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is to drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches
and they have the political power still if they only had the sense to use it for their preservation
i suppose you agree that the middle classes are stupid  mr verloc agreed hoarsely
they are  they have no imagination
they are blinded by an idiotic vanity
what they want just now is a jolly good scare
this is the psychological moment to set your friends to work
i have had you called here to develop to you my idea  and mr vladimir developed his idea from on high with scorn and condescension displaying at the same time an amount of ignorance as to the real aims thoughts and methods of the revolutionary world which filled the silent mr verloc with inward consternation
he confounded causes with effects more than was excusable the most distinguished propagandists with impulsive bomb throwers assumed organisation where in the nature of things it could not exist spoke of the social revolutionary party one moment as of a perfectly disciplined army where the word of chiefs was supreme and at another as if it had been the loosest association of desperate brigands that ever camped in a mountain gorge
once mr verloc had opened his mouth for a protest but the raising of a shapely large white hand arrested him
very soon he became too appalled to even try to protest
he listened in a stillness of dread which resembled the immobility of profound attention
a series of outrages mr vladimir continued calmly executed here in this country not only planned herethat would not dothey would not mind
your friends could set half the continent on fire without influencing the public opinion here in favour of a universal repressive legislation
they will not look outside their backyard here  mr verloc cleared his throat but his heart failed him and he said nothing
these outrages need not be especially sanguinary mr vladimir went on as if delivering a scientific lecture but they must be sufficiently startlingeffective
let them be directed against buildings for instance
what is the fetish of the hour that all the bourgeoisie recogniseeh mr verloc  mr verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders slightly
you are too lazy to think was mr vladimirs comment upon that gesture
pay attention to what i say
the fetish of today is neither royalty nor religion
therefore the palace and the church should be left alone
you understand what i mean mr verloc  the dismay and the scorn of mr verloc found vent in an attempt at levity
perfectly
but what of the embassies
a series of attacks on the various embassies he began but he could not withstand the cold watchful stare of the first secretary
you can be facetious i see the latter observed carelessly
thats all right
it may enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses
but this room is no place for it
it would be infinitely safer for you to follow carefully what i am saying
as you are being called upon to furnish facts instead of cockandbull stories you had better try to make your profit off what i am taking the trouble to explain to you
the sacrosanct fetish of today is science
why dont you get some of your friends to go for that woodenfaced panjandrumeh
is it not part of these institutions which must be swept away before the f p comes along  mr verloc said nothing
he was afraid to open his lips lest a groan should escape him
this is what you should try for
an attempt upon a crowned head or on a president is sensational enough in a way but not so much as it used to be
it has entered into the general conception of the existence of all chiefs of state
its almost conventionalespecially since so many presidents have been assassinated
now let us take an outrage uponsay a church
horrible enough at first sight no doubt and yet not so effective as a person of an ordinary mind might think
no matter how revolutionary and anarchist in inception there would be fools enough to give such an outrage the character of a religious manifestation
and that would detract from the especial alarming significance we wish to give to the act
a murderous attempt on a restaurant or a theatre would suffer in the same way from the suggestion of nonpolitical passion the exasperation of a hungry man an act of social revenge
all this is used up it is no longer instructive as an object lesson in revolutionary anarchism
every newspaper has readymade phrases to explain such manifestations away
i am about to give you the philosophy of bomb throwing from my point of view from the point of view you pretend to have been serving for the last eleven years
i will try not to talk above your head
the sensibilities of the class you are attacking are soon blunted
property seems to them an indestructible thing
you cant count upon their emotions either of pity or fear for very long
a bomb outrage to have any influence on public opinion now must go beyond the intention of vengeance or terrorism
it must be purely destructive
it must be that and only that beyond the faintest suspicion of any other object
you anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation
but how to get that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle classes so that there should be no mistake
thats the question
by directing your blows at something outside the ordinary passions of humanity is the answer
of course there is art
a bomb in the national gallery would make some noise
but it would not be serious enough
art has never been their fetish
its like breaking a few back windows in a mans house whereas if you want to make him really sit up you must try at least to raise the roof
there would be some screaming of course but from whom
artistsart critics and such likepeople of no account
nobody minds what they say
but there is learningscience
any imbecile that has got an income believes in that
he does not know why but he believes it matters somehow
it is the sacrosanct fetish
all the damned professors are radicals at heart
let them know that their great panjandrum has got to go too to make room for the future of the proletariat
a howl from all these intellectual idiots is bound to help forward the labours of the milan conference
they will be writing to the papers
their indignation would be above suspicion no material interests being openly at stake and it will alarm every selfishness of the class which should be impressed
they believe that in some mysterious way science is at the source of their material prosperity
they do
and the absurd ferocity of such a demonstration will affect them more profoundly than the mangling of a whole streetor theatrefull of their own kind
to that last they can always say oh
its mere class hate  but what is one to say to an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be incomprehensible inexplicable almost unthinkable in fact mad
madness alone is truly terrifying inasmuch as you cannot placate it either by threats persuasion or bribes
moreover i am a civilised man
i would never dream of directing you to organise a mere butchery even if i expected the best results from it
but i wouldnt expect from a butchery the result i want
murder is always with us
it is almost an institution
the demonstration must be against learningscience
but not every science will do
the attack must have all the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy
since bombs are your means of expression it would be really telling if one could throw a bomb into pure mathematics
but that is impossible
i have been trying to educate you i have expounded to you the higher philosophy of your usefulness and suggested to you some serviceable arguments
the practical application of my teaching interests you mostly
but from the moment i have undertaken to interview you i have also given some attention to the practical aspect of the question
what do you think of having a go at astronomy  for sometime already mr verlocs immobility by the side of the armchair resembled a state of collapsed comaa sort of passive insensibility interrupted by slight convulsive starts such as may be observed in the domestic dog having a nightmare on the hearthrug
and it was in an uneasy doglike growl that he repeated the word  astronomy  he had not recovered thoroughly as yet from that state of bewilderment brought about by the effort to follow mr vladimirs rapid incisive utterance
it had overcome his power of assimilation
it had made him angry
this anger was complicated by incredulity
and suddenly it dawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke
mr vladimir exhibited his white teeth in a smile with dimples on his round full face posed with a complacent inclination above the bristling bow of his necktie
the favourite of intelligent society women had assumed his drawingroom attitude accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms
sitting well forward his white hand upraised he seemed to hold delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his suggestion
there could be nothing better
such an outrage combines the greatest possible regard for humanity with the most alarming display of ferocious imbecility
i defy the ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public that any given member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance against astronomy
starvation itself could hardly be dragged in thereeh
and there are other advantages
the whole civilised world has heard of greenwich
the very bootblacks in the basement of charing cross station know something of it
see  the features of mr vladimir so well known in the best society by their humorous urbanity beamed with cynical selfsatisfaction which would have astonished the intelligent women his wit entertained so exquisitely
yes he continued with a contemptuous smile the blowing up of the first meridian is bound to raise a howl of execration  a difficult business mr verloc mumbled feeling that this was the only safe thing to say
what is the matter
havent you the whole gang under your hand
the very pick of the basket
that old terrorist yundt is here
i see him walking about piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day
and michaelis the ticketofleave apostleyou dont mean to say you dont know where he is
because if you dont i can tell you mr vladimir went on menacingly
if you imagine that you are the only one on the secret fund list you are mistaken  this perfectly gratuitous suggestion caused mr verloc to shuffle his feet slightly
and the whole lausanne loteh
havent they been flocking over here at the first hint of the milan conference
this is an absurd country  it will cost money mr verloc said by a sort of instinct
that cock wont fight mr vladimir retorted with an amazingly genuine english accent
youll get your screw every month and no more till something happens
and if nothing happens very soon you wont get even that
whats your ostensible occupation
what are you supposed to live by  i keep a shop answered mr verloc
a shop
what sort of shop  stationery newspapers
my wife  your what interrupted mr vladimir in his guttural central asian tones
my wife  mr verloc raised his husky voice slightly
i am married  that be damned for a yarn exclaimed the other in unfeigned astonishment
married
and you a professed anarchist too
what is this confounded nonsense
but i suppose its merely a manner of speaking
anarchists dont marry
its well known
they cant
it would be apostasy  my wife isnt one mr verloc mumbled sulkily
moreover its no concern of yours  oh yes it is snapped mr vladimir
i am beginning to be convinced that you are not at all the man for the work youve been employed on
why you must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by your marriage
couldnt you have managed without
this is your virtuous attachmenteh
what with one sort of attachment and another you are doing away with your usefulness  mr verloc puffing out his cheeks let the air escape violently and that was all
he had armed himself with patience
it was not to be tried much longer
the first secretary became suddenly very curt detached final
you may go now he said
a dynamite outrage must be provoked
i give you a month
the sittings of the conference are suspended
before it reassembles again something must have happened here or your connection with us ceases  he changed the note once more with an unprincipled versatility
think over my philosophy mrmrverloc he said with a sort of chaffing condescension waving his hand towards the door
go for the first meridian
you dont know the middle classes as well as i do
their sensibilities are jaded
the first meridian
nothing better and nothing easier i should think  he had got up and with his thin sensitive lips twitching humorously watched in the glass over the mantelpiece mr verloc backing out of the room heavily hat and stick in hand
the door closed
the footman in trousers appearing suddenly in the corridor let mr verloc another way out and through a small door in the corner of the courtyard
the porter standing at the gate ignored his exit completely and mr verloc retraced the path of his mornings pilgrimage as if in a dreaman angry dream
this detachment from the material world was so complete that though the mortal envelope of mr verloc had not hastened unduly along the streets that part of him to which it would be unwarrantably rude to refuse immortality found itself at the shop door all at once as if borne from west to east on the wings of a great wind
he walked straight behind the counter and sat down on a wooden chair that stood there
no one appeared to disturb his solitude
stevie put into a green baize apron was now sweeping and dusting upstairs intent and conscientious as though he were playing at it and mrs verloc warned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell had merely come to the glazed door of the parlour and putting the curtain aside a little had peered into the dim shop
seeing her husband sitting there shadowy and bulky with his hat tilted far back on his head she had at once returned to her stove
an hour or more later she took the green baize apron off her brother stevie and instructed him to wash his hands and face in the peremptory tone she had used in that connection for fifteen years or soever since she had in fact ceased to attend to the boys hands and face herself
she spared presently a glance away from her dishingup for the inspection of that face and those hands which stevie approaching the kitchen table offered for her approval with an air of selfassurance hiding a perpetual residue of anxiety
formerly the anger of the father was the supremely effective sanction of these rites but mr verlocs placidity in domestic life would have made all mention of anger incredible even to poor stevies nervousness
the theory was that mr verloc would have been inexpressibly pained and shocked by any deficiency of cleanliness at meal times
winnie after the death of her father found considerable consolation in the feeling that she need no longer tremble for poor stevie
she could not bear to see the boy hurt
it maddened her
as a little girl she had often faced with blazing eyes the irascible licensed victualler in defence of her brother
nothing now in mrs verlocs appearance could lead one to suppose that she was capable of a passionate demonstration
she finished her dishingup
the table was laid in the parlour
going to the foot of the stairs she screamed out mother  then opening the glazed door leading to the shop she said quietly adolf  mr verloc had not changed his position he had not apparently stirred a limb for an hour and a half
he got up heavily and came to his dinner in his overcoat and with his hat on without uttering a word
his silence in itself had nothing startlingly unusual in this household hidden in the shades of the sordid street seldom touched by the sun behind the dim shop with its wares of disreputable rubbish
only that day mr verlocs taciturnity was so obviously thoughtful that the two women were impressed by it
they sat silent themselves keeping a watchful eye on poor stevie lest he should break out into one of his fits of loquacity
he faced mr verloc across the table and remained very good and quiet staring vacantly
the endeavour to keep him from making himself objectionable in any way to the master of the house put no inconsiderable anxiety into these two womens lives
that boy as they alluded to him softly between themselves had been a source of that sort of anxiety almost from the very day of his birth
the late licensed victuallers humiliation at having such a very peculiar boy for a son manifested itself by a propensity to brutal treatment for he was a person of fine sensibilities and his sufferings as a man and a father were perfectly genuine
afterwards stevie had to be kept from making himself a nuisance to the single gentlemen lodgers who are themselves a queer lot and are easily aggrieved
and there was always the anxiety of his mere existence to face
visions of a workhouse infirmary for her child had haunted the old woman in the basement breakfastroom of the decayed belgravian house
if you had not found such a good husband my dear she used to say to her daughter i dont know what would have become of that poor boy  mr verloc extended as much recognition to stevie as a man not particularly fond of animals may give to his wifes beloved cat and this recognition benevolent and perfunctory was essentially of the same quality
both women admitted to themselves that not much more could be reasonably expected
it was enough to earn for mr verloc the old womans reverential gratitude
in the early days made sceptical by the trials of friendless life she used sometimes to ask anxiously you dont think my dear that mr verloc is getting tired of seeing stevie about to this winnie replied habitually by a slight toss of her head
once however she retorted with a rather grim pertness hell have to get tired of me first  a long silence ensued
the mother with her feet propped up on a stool seemed to be trying to get to the bottom of that answer whose feminine profundity had struck her all of a heap
she had never really understood why winnie had married mr verloc
it was very sensible of her and evidently had turned out for the best but her girl might have naturally hoped to find somebody of a more suitable age
there had been a steady young fellow only son of a butcher in the next street helping his father in business with whom winnie had been walking out with obvious gusto
he was dependent on his father it is true but the business was good and his prospects excellent
he took her girl to the theatre on several evenings
then just as she began to dread to hear of their engagement for what could she have done with that big house alone with stevie on her hands that romance came to an abrupt end and winnie went about looking very dull
but mr verloc turning up providentially to occupy the firstfloor front bedroom there had been no more question of the young butcher
it was clearly providential
chapter iii    
  all idealisation makes life poorer
to beautify it is to take away its character of complexityit is to destroy it
leave that to the moralists my boy
history is made by men but they do not make it in their heads
the ideas that are born in their consciousness play an insignificant part in the march of events
history is dominated and determined by the tool and the productionby the force of economic conditions
capitalism has made socialism and the laws made by the capitalism for the protection of property are responsible for anarchism
no one can tell what form the social organisation may take in the future
then why indulge in prophetic phantasies
at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet and can have no objective value
leave that pastime to the moralists my boy  michaelis the ticketofleave apostle was speaking in an even voice a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest
he had come out of a highly hygienic prison round like a tub with an enormous stomach and distended cheeks of a pale semitransparent complexion as though for fifteen years the servants of an outraged society had made a point of stuffing him with fattening foods in a damp and lightless cellar
and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce
it was said that for three seasons running a very wealthy old lady had sent him for a cure to marienbadwhere he was about to share the public curiosity once with a crowned headbut the police on that occasion ordered him to leave within twelve hours
his martyrdom was continued by forbidding him all access to the healing waters
but he was resigned now
with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummys limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate
yes
i had the time to think things out a little he added without emphasis
society has given me plenty of time for meditation  on the other side of the fireplace in the horsehair armchair where mrs verlocs mother was generally privileged to sit karl yundt giggled grimly with a faint black grimace of a toothless mouth
the terrorist as he called himself was old and bald with a narrow snowwhite wisp of a goatee hanging limply from his chin
an extraordinary expression of underhand malevolence survived in his extinguished eyes
when he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab
he leaned on a thick stick which trembled under his other hand
i have always dreamed he mouthed fiercely of a band of men absolute in their resolve to discard all scruples in the choice of means strong enough to give themselves frankly the name of destroyers and free from the taint of that resigned pessimism which rots the world
no pity for anything on earth including themselves and death enlisted for good and all in the service of humanitythats what i would have liked to see  his little bald head quivered imparting a comical vibration to the wisp of white goatee
his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger
his wornout passion resembling in its impotent fierceness the excitement of a senile sensualist was badly served by a dried throat and toothless gums which seemed to catch the tip of his tongue
mr verloc established in the corner of the sofa at the other end of the room emitted two hearty grunts of assent
the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side
and i could never get as many as three such men together
so much for your rotten pessimism he snarled at michaelis who uncrossed his thick legs similar to bolsters and slid his feet abruptly under his chair in sign of exasperation
he a pessimist
preposterous
he cried out that the charge was outrageous
he was so far from pessimism that he saw already the end of all private property coming along logically unavoidably by the mere development of its inherent viciousness
the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat but they had also to fight amongst themselves
yes
struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership
it was fatal
ah
he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief no declamations no anger no visions of bloodred flags waving or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society
not he
cold reason he boasted was the basis of his optimism
yes optimism  his laborious wheezing stopped then after a gasp or two he added  dont you think that if i had not been the optimist i am i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat
and in the last instance there were always the walls of my cell to dash my head against  the shortness of breath took all fire all animation out of his voice his great pale cheeks hung like filled pouches motionless without a quiver but in his blue eyes narrowed as if peering there was the same look of confident shrewdness a little crazy in its fixity they must have had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell
before him karl yundt remained standing one wing of his faded greenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder
seated in front of the fireplace comrade ossipon exmedical student the principal writer of the f p leaflets stretched out his robust legs keeping the soles of his boots turned up to the glow in the grate
a bush of crinkly yellow hair topped his red freckled face with a flattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro type
his almondshaped eyes leered languidly over the high cheekbones
he wore a grey flannel shirt the loose ends of a black silk tie hung down the buttoned breast of his serge coat and his head resting on the back of his chair his throat largely exposed he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long wooden tube puffing jets of smoke straight up at the ceiling
michaelis pursued his ideathe idea of his solitary reclusionthe thought vouchsafed to his captivity and growing like a faith revealed in visions
he talked to himself indifferent to the sympathy or hostility of his hearers indifferent indeed to their presence from the habit he had acquired of thinking aloud hopefully in the solitude of the four whitewashed walls of his cell in the sepulchral silence of the great blind pile of bricks near a river sinister and ugly like a colossal mortuary for the socially drowned
he was no good in discussion not because any amount of argument could shake his faith but because the mere fact of hearing another voice disconcerted him painfully confusing his thoughts at oncethese thoughts that for so many years in a mental solitude more barren than a waterless desert no living voice had ever combatted commented or approved
no one interrupted him now and he made again the confession of his faith mastering him irresistible and complete like an act of grace the secret of fate discovered in the material side of life the economic condition of the world responsible for the past and shaping the future the source of all history of all ideas guiding the mental development of mankind and the very impulses of their passion  a harsh laugh from comrade ossipon cut the tirade dead short in a sudden faltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness of the apostles mildly exalted eyes
he closed them slowly for a moment as if to collect his routed thoughts
a silence fell but what with the two gasjets over the table and the glowing grate the little parlour behind mr verlocs shop had become frightfully hot
mr verloc getting off the sofa with ponderous reluctance opened the door leading into the kitchen to get more air and thus disclosed the innocent stevie seated very good and quiet at a deal table drawing circles circles circles innumerable circles concentric eccentric a coruscating whirl of circles that by their tangled multitude of repeated curves uniformity of form and confusion of intersecting lines suggested a rendering of cosmic chaos the symbolism of a mad art attempting the inconceivable
the artist never turned his head and in all his souls application to the task his back quivered his thin neck sunk into a deep hollow at the base of the skull seemed ready to snap
mr verloc after a grunt of disapproving surprise returned to the sofa
alexander ossipon got up tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling shook off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevies shoulder
he came back pronouncing oracularly very good
very characteristic perfectly typical  whats very good grunted inquiringly mr verloc settled again in the corner of the sofa
the other explained his meaning negligently with a shade of condescension and a toss of his head towards the kitchen  typical of this form of degeneracythese drawings i mean  you would call that lad a degenerate would you mumbled mr verloc
comrade alexander ossiponnicknamed the doctor exmedical student without a degree afterwards wandering lecturer to workingmens associations upon the socialistic aspects of hygiene author of a popular quasimedical study in the form of a cheap pamphlet seized promptly by the police entitled the corroding vices of the middle classes special delegate of the more or less mysterious red committee together with karl yundt and michaelis for the work of literary propagandaturned upon the obscure familiar of at least two embassies that glance of insufferable hopelessly dense sufficiency which nothing but the frequentation of science can give to the dulness of common mortals
thats what he may be called scientifically
very good type too altogether of that sort of degenerate
its enough to glance at the lobes of his ears
if you read lombroso  mr verloc moody and spread largely on the sofa continued to look down the row of his waistcoat buttons but his cheeks became tinged by a faint blush
of late even the merest derivative of the word science a term in itself inoffensive and of indefinite meaning had the curious power of evoking a definitely offensive mental vision of mr vladimir in his body as he lived with an almost supernatural clearness
and this phenomenon deserving justly to be classed amongst the marvels of science induced in mr verloc an emotional state of dread and exasperation tending to express itself in violent swearing
but he said nothing
it was karl yundt who was heard implacable to his last breath
lombroso is an ass  comrade ossipon met the shock of this blasphemy by an awful vacant stare
and the other his extinguished eyes without gleams blackening the deep shadows under the great bony forehead mumbled catching the tip of his tongue between his lips at every second word as though he were chewing it angrily  did you ever see such an idiot
for him the criminal is the prisoner
simple is it not
what about those who shut him up thereforced him in there
exactly
forced him in there
and what is crime
does he know that this imbecile who has made his way in this world of gorged fools by looking at the ears and teeth of a lot of poor luckless devils
teeth and ears mark the criminal
do they
and what about the law that marks him still betterthe pretty branding instrument invented by the overfed to protect themselves against the hungry
redhot applications on their vile skinshey
cant you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle
thats how criminals are made for your lombrosos to write their silly stuff about  the knob of his stick and his legs shook together with passion whilst the trunk draped in the wings of the havelock preserved his historic attitude of defiance
he seemed to sniff the tainted air of social cruelty to strain his ear for its atrocious sounds
there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing
the all but moribund veteran of dynamite wars had been a great actor in his timeactor on platforms in secret assemblies in private interviews
the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice
he was no man of action he was not even an orator of torrential eloquence sweeping the masses along in the rushing noise and foam of a great enthusiasm
with a more subtle intention he took the part of an insolent and venomous evoker of sinister impulses which lurk in the blind envy and exasperated vanity of ignorance in the suffering and misery of poverty in all the hopeful and noble illusions of righteous anger pity and revolt
the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbishheap of things that had served their time
michaelis the ticketofleave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent
he had been a prisoner himself
his own skin had sizzled under the redhot brand he murmured softly
but comrade ossipon nicknamed the doctor had got over the shock by that time
you dont understand he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound
he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders
stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him
he had reached the parlour door in time to receive in full the shock of karl yundts eloquent imagery
the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain
stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to ones skin hurt very much
his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly
his mouth dropped open
michaelis by staring unwinkingly at the fire had regained that sentiment of isolation necessary for the continuity of his thought
his optimism had begun to flow from his lips
he saw capitalism doomed in its cradle born with the poison of the principle of competition in its system
the great capitalists devouring the little capitalists concentrating the power and the tools of production in great masses perfecting industrial processes and in the madness of selfaggrandisement only preparing organising enriching making ready the lawful inheritance of the suffering proletariat
michaelis pronounced the great word patienceand his clear blue glance raised to the low ceiling of mr verlocs parlour had a character of seraphic trustfulness
in the doorway stevie calmed seemed sunk in hebetude
comrade ossipons face twitched with exasperation
then its no use doing anythingno use whatever  i dont say that protested michaelis gently
his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time
he continued to look down at the red coals
preparation for the future was necessary and he was willing to admit that the great change would perhaps come in the upheaval of a revolution
but he argued that revolutionary propaganda was a delicate work of high conscience
it was the education of the masters of the world
it should be as careful as the education given to kings
he would have it advance its tenets cautiously even timidly in our ignorance of the effect that may be produced by any given economic change upon the happiness the morals the intellect the history of mankind
for history is made with tools not with ideas and everything is changed by economic conditionsart philosophy love virtuetruth itself
the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously
round like a distended balloon he opened his short thick arms as if in a pathetically hopeless attempt to embrace and hug to his breast a selfregenerated universe
he gasped with ardour
the future is as certain as the pastslavery feudalism individualism collectivism
this is the statement of a law not an empty prophecy  the disdainful pout of comrade ossipons thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face
nonsense he said calmly enough
there is no law and no certainty
the teaching propaganda be hanged
what the people knows does not matter were its knowledge ever so accurate
the only thing that matters to us is the emotional state of the masses
without emotion there is no action  he paused then added with modest firmness  i am speaking now to you scientificallyscientificallyeh
what did you say verloc  nothing growled from the sofa mr verloc who provoked by the abhorrent sound had merely muttered a damn  the venomous spluttering of the old terrorist without teeth was heard
do you know how i would call the nature of the present economic conditions
i would call it cannibalistic
thats what it is
they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the peoplenothing else  stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door
michaelis gave no sign of having heard anything
his lips seemed glued together for good not a quiver passed over his heavy cheeks
with troubled eyes he looked for his round hard hat and put it on his round head
his round and obese body seemed to float low between the chairs under the sharp elbow of karl yundt
the old terrorist raising an uncertain and clawlike hand gave a swaggering tilt to a black felt sombrero shading the hollows and ridges of his wasted face
he got in motion slowly striking the floor with his stick at every step
it was rather an affair to get him out of the house because now and then he would stop as if to think and did not offer to move again till impelled forward by michaelis
the gentle apostle grasped his arm with brotherly care and behind them his hands in his pockets the robust ossipon yawned vaguely
a blue cap with a patent leather peak set well at the back of his yellow bush of hair gave him the aspect of a norwegian sailor bored with the world after a thundering spree
mr verloc saw his guests off the premises attending them bareheaded his heavy overcoat hanging open his eyes on the ground
he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt
he was not satisfied with his friends
in the light of mr vladimirs philosophy of bomb throwing they appeared hopelessly futile
the part of mr verloc in revolutionary politics having been to observe he could not all at once either in his own home or in larger assemblies take the initiative of action
he had to be cautious
moved by the just indignation of a man well over forty menaced in what is dearest to himhis repose and his securityhe asked himself scornfully what else could have been expected from such a lot this karl yundt this michaelisthis ossipon
pausing in his intention to turn off the gas burning in the middle of the shop mr verloc descended into the abyss of moral reflections
with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict
a lazy lotthis karl yundt nursed by a bleareyed old woman a woman he had years ago enticed away from a friend and afterwards had tried more than once to shake off into the gutter
jolly lucky for yundt that she had persisted in coming up time after time or else there would have been no one now to help him out of the bus by the green park railings where that spectre took its constitutional crawl every fine morning
when that indomitable snarling old witch died the swaggering spectre would have to vanish toothere would be an end to fiery karl yundt
and mr verlocs morality was offended also by the optimism of michaelis annexed by his wealthy old lady who had taken lately to sending him to a cottage she had in the country
the exprisoner could moon about the shady lanes for days together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness
as to ossipon that beggar was sure to want for nothing as long as there were silly girls with savingsbank books in the world
and mr verloc temperamentally identical with his associates drew fine distinctions in his mind on the strength of insignificant differences
he drew them with a certain complacency because the instinct of conventional respectability was strong within him being only overcome by his dislike of all kinds of recognised laboura temperamental defect which he shared with a large proportion of revolutionary reformers of a given social state
for obviously one does not revolt against the advantages and opportunities of that state but against the price which must be paid for the same in the coin of accepted morality selfrestraint and toil
the majority of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue mostly
there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable
those are the fanatics
the remaining portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity the mother of all noble and vile illusions the companion of poets reformers charlatans prophets and incendiaries
lost for a whole minute in the abyss of meditation mr verloc did not reach the depth of these abstract considerations
perhaps he was not able
in any case he had not the time
he was pulled up painfully by the sudden recollection of mr vladimir another of his associates whom in virtue of subtle moral affinities he was capable of judging correctly
he considered him as dangerous
a shade of envy crept into his thoughts
loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mr vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for  at this point by a simple association of ideas mr verloc was brought face to face with the necessity of going to bed some time or other that evening
then why not go nowat once
he sighed
the necessity was not so normally pleasurable as it ought to have been for a man of his age and temperament
he dreaded the demon of sleeplessness which he felt had marked him for its own
he raised his arm and turned off the flaring gasjet above his head
a bright band of light fell through the parlour door into the part of the shop behind the counter
it enabled mr verloc to ascertain at a glance the number of silver coins in the till
these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value
this survey was unfavourable
he had gone into trade for no commercial reasons
he had been guided in the selection of this peculiar line of business by an instinctive leaning towards shady transactions where money is picked up easily
moreover it did not take him out of his own spherethe sphere which is watched by the police
on the contrary it gave him a publicly confessed standing in that sphere and as mr verloc had unconfessed relations which made him familiar with yet careless of the police there was a distinct advantage in such a situation
but as a means of livelihood it was by itself insufficient
he took the cashbox out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs
what on earth is he doing there
mr verloc asked himself
whats the meaning of these antics
he looked dubiously at his brotherinlaw but he did not ask him for information
mr verlocs intercourse with stevie was limited to the casual mutter of a morning after breakfast my boots and even that was more a communication at large of a need than a direct order or request
mr verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie
he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence
nor yet did he know what would happen if he did say anything
and this appeared very queer to mr verloc in view of the fact borne upon him suddenly that he had to provide for this fellow too
he had never given a moments thought till then to that aspect of stevies existence
positively he did not know how to speak to the lad
he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen
stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage
a tentative hadnt you better go to bed now produced no effect whatever and mr verloc abandoning the stony contemplation of his brotherinlaws behaviour crossed the parlour wearily cashbox in hand
the cause of the general lassitude he felt while climbing the stairs being purely mental he became alarmed by its inexplicable character
he hoped he was not sickening for anything
he stopped on the dark landing to examine his sensations
but a slight and continuous sound of snoring pervading the obscurity interfered with their clearness
the sound came from his motherinlaws room
another one to provide for he thoughtand on this thought walked into the bedroom
mrs verloc had fallen asleep with the lamp no gas was laid upstairs turned up full on the table by the side of the bed
the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night
she woke up with the sound of her name in her ears and saw her husband standing over her
winnie
winnie  at first she did not stir lying very quiet and looking at the cashbox in mr verlocs hand
but when she understood that her brother was capering all over the place downstairs she swung out in one sudden movement on to the edge of the bed
her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husbands face
i dont know how to manage him mr verloc explained peevishly
wont do to leave him downstairs alone with the lights  she said nothing glided across the room swiftly and the door closed upon her white form
mr verloc deposited the cashbox on the night table and began the operation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a distant chair
his coat and waistcoat followed
he walked about the room in his stockinged feet and his burly figure with the hands worrying nervously at his throat passed and repassed across the long strip of lookingglass in the door of his wifes wardrobe
then after slipping his braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian blind and leaned his forehead against the cold windowpanea fragile film of glass stretched between him and the enormity of cold black wet muddy inhospitable accumulation of bricks slates and stones things in themselves unlovely and unfriendly to man
mr verloc felt the latent unfriendliness of all out of doors with a force approaching to positive bodily anguish
there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police
its like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain
the comparison occurred to mr verloc because he had sat astride various army horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall
the prospect was as black as the windowpane against which he was leaning his forehead
and suddenly the face of mr vladimir cleanshaved and witty appeared enhaloed in the glow of its rosy complexion like a sort of pink seal impressed on the fatal darkness
this luminous and mutilated vision was so ghastly physically that mr verloc started away from the window letting down the venetian blind with a great rattle
discomposed and speechless with the apprehension of more such visions he beheld his wife reenter the room and get into bed in a calm businesslike manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the world
mrs verloc expressed her surprise at seeing him up yet
i dont feel very well he muttered passing his hands over his moist brow
giddiness  yes
not at all well  mrs verloc with all the placidity of an experienced wife expressed a confident opinion as to the cause and suggested the usual remedies but her husband rooted in the middle of the room shook his lowered head sadly
youll catch cold standing there she observed
mr verloc made an effort finished undressing and got into bed
down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passerby had started to pace out all eternity from gaslamp to gaslamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom
mrs verloc on her back and staring at the ceiling made a remark
takings very small today  mr verloc in the same position cleared his throat as if for an important statement but merely inquired  did you turn off the gas downstairs  yes i did answered mrs verloc conscientiously
that poor boy is in a very excited state tonight she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock
mr verloc cared nothing for stevies excitement but he felt horribly wakeful and dreaded facing the darkness and silence that would follow the extinguishing of the lamp
this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed
mrs verloc falling into the trap started to demonstrate at length to her husband that this was not impudence of any sort but simply excitement there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head
mrs verloc turning towards her recumbent husband raised herself on her elbow and hung over him in her anxiety that he should believe stevie to be a useful member of the family
that ardour of protecting compassion exalted morbidly in her childhood by the misery of another child tinged her sallow cheeks with a faint dusky blush made her big eyes gleam under the dark lids
mrs verloc then looked younger she looked as young as winnie used to look and much more animated than the winnie of the belgravian mansion days had ever allowed herself to appear to gentlemen lodgers
mr verlocs anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying
it was as if her voice were talking on the other side of a very thick wall
it was her aspect that recalled him to himself
he appreciated this woman and the sentiment of this appreciation stirred by a display of something resembling emotion only added another pang to his mental anguish
when her voice ceased he moved uneasily and said  i havent been feeling well for the last few days  he might have meant this as an opening to a complete confidence but mrs verloc laid her head on the pillow again and staring upward went on  that boy hears too much of what is talked about here
if i had known they were coming tonight i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did
he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating peoples flesh and drinking blood
whats the good of talking like that  there was a note of indignant scorn in her voice
mr verloc was fully responsive now
ask karl yundt he growled savagely
mrs verloc with great decision pronounced karl yundt a disgusting old man  she declared openly her affection for michaelis
of the robust ossipon in whose presence she always felt uneasy behind an attitude of stony reserve she said nothing whatever
and continuing to talk of that brother who had been for so many years an object of care and fears  he isnt fit to hear whats said here
he believes its all true
he knows no better
he gets into his passions over it  mr verloc made no comment
he glared at me as if he didnt know who i was when i went downstairs
his heart was going like a hammer
he cant help being excitable
i woke mother up and asked her to sit with him till he went to sleep
it isnt his fault
hes no trouble when hes left alone  mr verloc made no comment
i wish he had never been to school mrs verloc began again brusquely
hes always taking away those newspapers from the window to read
he gets a red face poring over them
we dont get rid of a dozen numbers in a month
they only take up room in the front window
and mr ossipon brings every week a pile of these f p tracts to sell at a halfpenny each
i wouldnt give a halfpenny for the whole lot
its silly readingthats what it is
theres no sale for it
the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing halfoff the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it
the brute
i couldnt do anything with stevie that afternoon
the story was enough too to make ones blood boil
but whats the use of printing things like that
we arent german slaves here thank god
its not our businessis it  mr verloc made no reply
i had to take the carving knife from the boy mrs verloc continued a little sleepily now
he was shouting and stamping and sobbing
he cant stand the notion of any cruelty
he would have stuck that officer like a pig if he had seen him then
its true too
some people dont deserve much mercy  mrs verlocs voice ceased and the expression of her motionless eyes became more and more contemplative and veiled during the long pause
comfortable dear she asked in a faint faraway voice
shall i put out the light now  the dreary conviction that there was no sleep for him held mr verloc mute and hopelessly inert in his fear of darkness
he made a great effort
yes
put it out he said at last in a hollow tone
chapter iv   most of the thirty or so little tables covered by red cloths with a white design stood ranged at right angles to the deep brown wainscoting of the underground hall
bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the low slightly vaulted ceiling and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull all round the walls without windows representing scenes of the chase and of outdoor revelry in medival costumes
varlets in green jerkins brandished hunting knives and raised on high tankards of foaming beer
unless i am very much mistaken you are the man who would know the inside of this confounded affair said the robust ossipon leaning over his elbows far out on the table and his feet tucked back completely under his chair
his eyes stared with wild eagerness
an upright semigrand piano near the door flanked by two palms in pots executed suddenly all by itself a valse tune with aggressive virtuosity
the din it raised was deafening
when it ceased as abruptly as it had started the bespectacled dingy little man who faced ossipon behind a heavy glass mug full of beer emitted calmly what had the sound of a general proposition
in principle what one of us may or may not know as to any given fact cant be a matter for inquiry to the others  certainly not comrade ossipon agreed in a quiet undertone
in principle  with his big florid face held between his hands he continued to stare hard while the dingy little man in spectacles coolly took a drink of beer and stood the glass mug back on the table
his flat large ears departed widely from the sides of his skull which looked frail enough for ossipon to crush between thumb and forefinger the dome of the forehead seemed to rest on the rim of the spectacles the flat cheeks of a greasy unhealthy complexion were merely smudged by the miserable poverty of a thin dark whisker
the lamentable inferiority of the whole physique was made ludicrous by the supremely selfconfident bearing of the individual
his speech was curt and he had a particularly impressive manner of keeping silent
ossipon spoke again from between his hands in a mutter
have you been out much today  no
i stayed in bed all the morning answered the other
why  oh
nothing said ossipon gazing earnestly and quivering inwardly with the desire to find out something but obviously intimidated by the little mans overwhelming air of unconcern
when talking with this comradewhich happened but rarelythe big ossipon suffered from a sense of moral and even physical insignificance
however he ventured another question
did you walk down here  no omnibus the little man answered readily enough
he lived far away in islington in a small house down a shabby street littered with straw and dirty paper where out of school hours a troop of assorted children ran and squabbled with a shrill joyless rowdy clamour
his single back room remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard he rented furnished from two elderly spinsters dressmakers in a humble way with a clientele of servant girls mostly
he had a heavy padlock put on the cupboard but otherwise he was a model lodger giving no trouble and requiring practically no attendance
his oddities were that he insisted on being present when his room was being swept and that when he went out he locked his door and took the key away with him
ossipon had a vision of these round blackrimmed spectacles progressing along the streets on the top of an omnibus their selfconfident glitter falling here and there on the walls of houses or lowered upon the heads of the unconscious stream of people on the pavements
the ghost of a sickly smile altered the set of ossipons thick lips at the thought of the walls nodding of people running for life at the sight of those spectacles
if they had only known
what a panic
he murmured interrogatively been sitting long here  an hour or more answered the other negligently and took a pull at the dark beer
all his movementsthe way he grasped the mug the act of drinking the way he set the heavy glass down and folded his armshad a firmness an assured precision which made the big and muscular ossipon leaning forward with staring eyes and protruding lips look the picture of eager indecision
an hour he said
then it may be you havent heard yet the news ive heard just nowin the street
have you  the little man shook his head negatively the least bit
but as he gave no indication of curiosity ossipon ventured to add that he had heard it just outside the place
a newspaper boy had yelled the thing under his very nose and not being prepared for anything of that sort he was very much startled and upset
he had to come in there with a dry mouth
i never thought of finding you here he added murmuring steadily with his elbows planted on the table
i come here sometimes said the other preserving his provoking coolness of demeanour
its wonderful that you of all people should have heard nothing of it the big ossipon continued
his eyelids snapped nervously upon the shining eyes
you of all people he repeated tentatively
this obvious restraint argued an incredible and inexplicable timidity of the big fellow before the calm little man who again lifted the glass mug drank and put it down with brusque and assured movements
and that was all
ossipon after waiting for something word or sign that did not come made an effort to assume a sort of indifference
do you he said deadening his voice still more give your stuff to anybody whos up to asking you for it  my absolute rule is never to refuse anybodyas long as i have a pinch by me answered the little man with decision
thats a principle commented ossipon
its a principle  and you think its sound  the large round spectacles which gave a look of staring selfconfidence to the sallow face confronted ossipon like sleepless unwinking orbs flashing a cold fire
perfectly
always
under every circumstance
what could stop me
why should i not
why should i think twice about it  ossipon gasped as it were discreetly
do you mean to say you would hand it over to a teck if one came to ask you for your wares  the other smiled faintly
let them come and try it on and you will see he said
they know me but i know also every one of them
they wont come near menot they  his thin livid lips snapped together firmly
ossipon began to argue
but they could send someonerig a plant on you
dont you see
get the stuff from you in that way and then arrest you with the proof in their hands  proof of what
dealing in explosives without a licence perhaps  this was meant for a contemptuous jeer though the expression of the thin sickly face remained unchanged and the utterance was negligent
i dont think theres one of them anxious to make that arrest
i dont think they could get one of them to apply for a warrant
i mean one of the best
not one  why ossipon asked
because they know very well i take care never to part with the last handful of my wares
ive it always by me  he touched the breast of his coat lightly
in a thick glass flask he added
so i have been told said ossipon with a shade of wonder in his voice
but i didnt know if  they know interrupted the little man crisply leaning against the straight chair back which rose higher than his fragile head
i shall never be arrested
the game isnt good enough for any policeman of them all
to deal with a man like me you require sheer naked inglorious heroism  again his lips closed with a selfconfident snap
ossipon repressed a movement of impatience
or recklessnessor simply ignorance he retorted
theyve only to get somebody for the job who does not know you carry enough stuff in your pocket to blow yourself and everything within sixty yards of you to pieces  i never affirmed i could not be eliminated rejoined the other
but that wouldnt be an arrest
moreover its not so easy as it looks  bah ossipon contradicted
dont be too sure of that
whats to prevent halfadozen of them jumping upon you from behind in the street
with your arms pinned to your sides you could do nothingcould you  yes i could
i am seldom out in the streets after dark said the little man impassively and never very late
i walk always with my right hand closed round the indiarubber ball which i have in my trouser pocket
the pressing of this ball actuates a detonator inside the flask i carry in my pocket
its the principle of the pneumatic instantaneous shutter for a camera lens
the tube leads up  with a swift disclosing gesture he gave ossipon a glimpse of an indiarubber tube resembling a slender brown worm issuing from the armhole of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket of his jacket
his clothes of a nondescript brown mixture were threadbare and marked with stains dusty in the folds with ragged buttonholes
the detonator is partly mechanical partly chemical he explained with casual condescension
it is instantaneous of course murmured ossipon with a slight shudder
far from it confessed the other with a reluctance which seemed to twist his mouth dolorously
a full twenty seconds must elapse from the moment i press the ball till the explosion takes place  phew whistled ossipon completely appalled
twenty seconds
horrors
you mean to say that you could face that
i should go crazy  wouldnt matter if you did
of course its the weak point of this special system which is only for my own use
the worst is that the manner of exploding is always the weak point with us
i am trying to invent a detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions of action and even to unexpected changes of conditions
a variable and yet perfectly precise mechanism
a really intelligent detonator  twenty seconds muttered ossipon again
ough
and then  with a slight turn of the head the glitter of the spectacles seemed to gauge the size of the beer saloon in the basement of the renowned silenus restaurant
nobody in this room could hope to escape was the verdict of that survey
nor yet this couple going up the stairs now  the piano at the foot of the staircase clanged through a mazurka with brazen impetuosity as though a vulgar and impudent ghost were showing off
the keys sank and rose mysteriously
then all became still
for a moment ossipon imagined the overlighted place changed into a dreadful black hole belching horrible fumes choked with ghastly rubbish of smashed brickwork and mutilated corpses
he had such a distinct perception of ruin and death that he shuddered again
the other observed with an air of calm sufficiency  in the last instance it is character alone that makes for ones safety
there are very few people in the world whose character is as well established as mine  i wonder how you managed it growled ossipon
force of personality said the other without raising his voice and coming from the mouth of that obviously miserable organism the assertion caused the robust ossipon to bite his lower lip
force of personality he repeated with ostentatious calm
i have the means to make myself deadly but that by itself you understand is absolutely nothing in the way of protection
what is effective is the belief those people have in my will to use the means
thats their impression
it is absolute
therefore i am deadly  there are individuals of character amongst that lot too muttered ossipon ominously
possibly
but it is a matter of degree obviously since for instance i am not impressed by them
therefore they are inferior
they cannot be otherwise
their character is built upon conventional morality
it leans on the social order
mine stands free from everything artificial
they are bound in all sorts of conventions
they depend on life which in this connection is a historical fact surrounded by all sorts of restraints and considerations a complex organised fact open to attack at every point whereas i depend on death which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked
my superiority is evident  this is a transcendental way of putting it said ossipon watching the cold glitter of the round spectacles
ive heard karl yundt say much the same thing not very long ago  karl yundt mumbled the other contemptuously the delegate of the international red committee has been a posturing shadow all his life
there are three of you delegates arent there
i wont define the other two as you are one of them
but what you say means nothing
you are the worthy delegates for revolutionary propaganda but the trouble is not only that you are as unable to think independently as any respectable grocer or journalist of them all but that you have no character whatever  ossipon could not restrain a start of indignation
but what do you want from us he exclaimed in a deadened voice
what is it you are after yourself  a perfect detonator was the peremptory answer
what are you making that face for
you see you cant even bear the mention of something conclusive  i am not making a face growled the annoyed ossipon bearishly
you revolutionists the other continued with leisurely selfconfidence are the slaves of the social convention which is afraid of you slaves of it as much as the very police that stands up in the defence of that convention
clearly you are since you want to revolutionise it
it governs your thought of course and your action too and thus neither your thought nor your action can ever be conclusive  he paused tranquil with that air of close endless silence then almost immediately went on
you are not a bit better than the forces arrayed against youthan the police for instance
the other day i came suddenly upon chief inspector heat at the corner of tottenham court road
he looked at me very steadily
but i did not look at him
why should i give him more than a glance
he was thinking of many thingsof his superiors of his reputation of the law courts of his salary of newspapersof a hundred things
but i was thinking of my perfect detonator only
he meant nothing to me
he was as insignificant asi cant call to mind anything insignificant enough to compare him withexcept karl yundt perhaps
like to like
the terrorist and the policeman both come from the same basket
revolution legalitycounter moves in the same game forms of idleness at bottom identical
he plays his little gameso do you propagandists
but i dont play i work fourteen hours a day and go hungry sometimes
my experiments cost money now and again and then i must do without food for a day or two
youre looking at my beer
yes
i have had two glasses already and shall have another presently
this is a little holiday and i celebrate it alone
why not
ive the grit to work alone quite alone absolutely alone
ive worked alone for years  ossipons face had turned dusky red
at the perfect detonatoreh he sneered very low
yes retorted the other
it is a good definition
you couldnt find anything half so precise to define the nature of your activity with all your committees and delegations
it is i who am the true propagandist  we wont discuss that point said ossipon with an air of rising above personal considerations
i am afraid ill have to spoil your holiday for you though
theres a man blown up in greenwich park this morning  how do you know  they have been yelling the news in the streets since two oclock
i bought the paper and just ran in here
then i saw you sitting at this table
ive got it in my pocket now  he pulled the newspaper out
it was a goodsized rosy sheet as if flushed by the warmth of its own convictions which were optimistic
he scanned the pages rapidly
ah
here it is
bomb in greenwich park
there isnt much so far
halfpast eleven
foggy morning
effects of explosion felt as far as romney road and park place
enormous hole in the ground under a tree filled with smashed roots and broken branches
all round fragments of a mans body blown to pieces
thats all
the rests mere newspaper gup
no doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the observatory they say
hm
thats hardly credible  he looked at the paper for a while longer in silence then passed it to the other who after gazing abstractedly at the print laid it down without comment
it was ossipon who spoke firststill resentful
the fragments of only one man you note
ergo blew himself up
that spoils your day off for youdont it
were you expecting that sort of move
i hadnt the slightest ideanot the ghost of a notion of anything of the sort being planned to come off herein this country
under the present circumstances its nothing short of criminal  the little man lifted his thin black eyebrows with dispassionate scorn
criminal
what is that
what is crime
what can be the meaning of such an assertion  how am i to express myself
one must use the current words said ossipon impatiently
the meaning of this assertion is that this business may affect our position very adversely in this country
isnt that crime enough for you
i am convinced you have been giving away some of your stuff lately  ossipon stared hard
the other without flinching lowered and raised his head slowly
you have burst out the editor of the f p leaflets in an intense whisper
no
and are you really handing it over at large like this for the asking to the first fool that comes along  just so
the condemned social order has not been built up on paper and ink and i dont fancy that a combination of paper and ink will ever put an end to it whatever you may think
yes i would give the stuff with both hands to every man woman or fool that likes to come along
i know what you are thinking about
but i am not taking my cue from the red committee
i would see you all hounded out of here or arrestedor beheaded for that matterwithout turning a hair
what happens to us as individuals is not of the least consequence  he spoke carelessly without heat almost without feeling and ossipon secretly much affected tried to copy this detachment
if the police here knew their business they would shoot you full of holes with revolvers or else try to sandbag you from behind in broad daylight  the little man seemed already to have considered that point of view in his dispassionate selfconfident manner
yes he assented with the utmost readiness
but for that they would have to face their own institutions
do you see
that requires uncommon grit
grit of a special kind  ossipon blinked
i fancy thats exactly what would happen to you if you were to set up your laboratory in the states
they dont stand on ceremony with their institutions there  i am not likely to go and see
otherwise your remark is just admitted the other
they have more character over there and their character is essentially anarchistic
fertile ground for us the statesvery good ground
the great republic has the root of the destructive matter in her
the collective temperament is lawless
excellent
they may shoot us down but  you are too transcendental for me growled ossipon with moody concern
logical protested the other
there are several kinds of logic
this is the enlightened kind
america is all right
it is this country that is dangerous with her idealistic conception of legality
the social spirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous prejudices and that is fatal to our work
you talk of england being our only refuge
so much the worse
capua
what do we want with refuges
here you talk print plot and do nothing
i daresay its very convenient for such karl yundts  he shrugged his shoulders slightly then added with the same leisurely assurance to break up the superstition and worship of legality should be our aim
nothing would please me more than to see inspector heat and his likes take to shooting us down in broad daylight with the approval of the public
half our battle would be won then the disintegration of the old morality would have set in in its very temple
that is what you ought to aim at
but you revolutionists will never understand that
you plan the future you lose yourselves in reveries of economical systems derived from what is whereas whats wanted is a clean sweep and a clear start for a new conception of life
that sort of future will take care of itself if you will only make room for it
therefore i would shovel my stuff in heaps at the corners of the streets if i had enough for that and as i havent i do my best by perfecting a really dependable detonator  ossipon who had been mentally swimming in deep waters seized upon the last word as if it were a saving plank
yes
your detonators
i shouldnt wonder if it werent one of your detonators that made a clean sweep of the man in the park  a shade of vexation darkened the determined sallow face confronting ossipon
my difficulty consists precisely in experimenting practically with the various kinds
they must be tried after all
besides  ossipon interrupted
who could that fellow be
i assure you that we in london had no knowledgecouldnt you describe the person you gave the stuff to  the other turned his spectacles upon ossipon like a pair of searchlights
describe him he repeated slowly
i dont think there can be the slightest objection now
i will describe him to you in one wordverloc  ossipon whom curiosity had lifted a few inches off his seat dropped back as if hit in the face
verloc
impossible  the selfpossessed little man nodded slightly once
yes
hes the person
you cant say that in this case i was giving my stuff to the first fool that came along
he was a prominent member of the group as far as i understand  yes said ossipon
prominent
no not exactly
he was the centre for general intelligence and usually received comrades coming over here
more useful than important
man of no ideas
years ago he used to speak at meetingsin france i believe
not very well though
he was trusted by such men as latorre moser and all that old lot
the only talent he showed really was his ability to elude the attentions of the police somehow
here for instance he did not seem to be looked after very closely
he was regularly married you know
i suppose its with her money that he started that shop
seemed to make it pay too  ossipon paused abruptly muttered to himself i wonder what that woman will do now and fell into thought
the other waited with ostentatious indifference
his parentage was obscure and he was generally known only by his nickname of professor
his title to that designation consisted in his having been once assistant demonstrator in chemistry at some technical institute
he quarrelled with the authorities upon a question of unfair treatment
afterwards he obtained a post in the laboratory of a manufactory of dyes
there too he had been treated with revolting injustice
his struggles his privations his hard work to raise himself in the social scale had filled him with such an exalted conviction of his merits that it was extremely difficult for the world to treat him with justicethe standard of that notion depending so much upon the patience of the individual
the professor had genius but lacked the great social virtue of resignation
intellectually a nonentity ossipon pronounced aloud abandoning suddenly the inward contemplation of mrs verlocs bereaved person and business
quite an ordinary personality
you are wrong in not keeping more in touch with the comrades professor he added in a reproving tone
did he say anything to yougive you some idea of his intentions
i hadnt seen him for a month
it seems impossible that he should be gone  he told me it was going to be a demonstration against a building said the professor
i had to know that much to prepare the missile
i pointed out to him that i had hardly a sufficient quantity for a completely destructive result but he pressed me very earnestly to do my best
as he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand i proposed to make use of an old onegallon copal varnish can i happened to have by me
he was pleased at the idea
it gave me some trouble because i had to cut out the bottom first and solder it on again afterwards
when prepared for use the can enclosed a widemouthed wellcorked jar of thick glass packed around with some wet clay and containing sixteen ounces of x green powder
the detonator was connected with the screw top of the can
it was ingeniousa combination of time and shock
i explained the system to him
it was a thin tube of tin enclosing a  ossipons attention had wandered
what do you think has happened he interrupted
cant tell
screwed the top on tight which would make the connection and then forgot the time
it was set for twenty minutes
on the other hand the time contact being made a sharp shock would bring about the explosion at once
he either ran the time too close or simply let the thing fall
the contact was made all rightthats clear to me at any rate
the systems worked perfectly
and yet you would think that a common fool in a hurry would be much more likely to forget to make the contact altogether
i was worrying myself about that sort of failure mostly
but there are more kinds of fools than one can guard against
you cant expect a detonator to be absolutely foolproof  he beckoned to a waiter
ossipon sat rigid with the abstracted gaze of mental travail
after the man had gone away with the money he roused himself with an air of profound dissatisfaction
its extremely unpleasant for me he mused
karl has been in bed with bronchitis for a week
theres an even chance that he will never get up again
michaeliss luxuriating in the country somewhere
a fashionable publisher has offered him five hundred pounds for a book
it will be a ghastly failure
he has lost the habit of consecutive thinking in prison you know  the professor on his feet now buttoning his coat looked about him with perfect indifference
what are you going to do asked ossipon wearily
he dreaded the blame of the central red committee a body which had no permanent place of abode and of whose membership he was not exactly informed
if this affair eventuated in the stoppage of the modest subsidy allotted to the publication of the f p pamphlets then indeed he would have to regret verlocs inexplicable folly
solidarity with the extremest form of action is one thing and silly recklessness is another he said with a sort of moody brutality
i dont know what came to verloc
theres some mystery there
however hes gone
you may take it as you like but under the circumstances the only policy for the militant revolutionary group is to disclaim all connection with this damned freak of yours
how to make the disclaimer convincing enough is what bothers me  the little man on his feet buttoned up and ready to go was no taller than the seated ossipon
he levelled his spectacles at the latters face pointblank
you might ask the police for a testimonial of good conduct
they know where every one of you slept last night
perhaps if you asked them they would consent to publish some sort of official statement  no doubt they are aware well enough that we had nothing to do with this mumbled ossipon bitterly
what they will say is another thing he remained thoughtful disregarding the short owlish shabby figure standing by his side
i must lay hands on michaelis at once and get him to speak from his heart at one of our gatherings
the public has a sort of sentimental regard for that fellow
his name is known
and i am in touch with a few reporters on the big dailies
what he would say would be utter bosh but he has a turn of talk that makes it go down all the same  like treacle interjected the professor rather low keeping an impassive expression
the perplexed ossipon went on communing with himself half audibly after the manner of a man reflecting in perfect solitude
confounded ass
to leave such an imbecile business on my hands
and i dont even know if  he sat with compressed lips
the idea of going for news straight to the shop lacked charm
his notion was that verlocs shop might have been turned already into a police trap
they will be bound to make some arrests he thought with something resembling virtuous indignation for the even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his
and yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of what perhaps it would be very material for him to know
then he reflected that if the man in the park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers said he could not have been identified
and if so the police could have no special reason for watching verlocs shop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by marked anarchistsno more reason in fact than for watching the doors of the silenus
there would be a lot of watching all round no matter where he went
still  i wonder what i had better do now he muttered taking counsel with himself
a rasping voice at his elbow said with sedate scorn  fasten yourself upon the woman for all shes worth  after uttering these words the professor walked away from the table
ossipon whom that piece of insight had taken unawares gave one ineffectual start and remained still with a helpless gaze as though nailed fast to the seat of his chair
the lonely piano without as much as a music stool to help it struck a few chords courageously and beginning a selection of national airs played him out at last to the tune of blue bells of scotland  the painfully detached notes grew faint behind his back while he went slowly upstairs across the hall and into the street
in front of the great doorway a dismal row of newspaper sellers standing clear of the pavement dealt out their wares from the gutter
it was a raw gloomy day of the early spring and the grimy sky the mud of the streets the rags of the dirty men harmonised excellently with the eruption of the damp rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers ink
the posters maculated with filth garnished like tapestry the sweep of the curbstone
the trade in afternoon papers was brisk yet in comparison with the swift constant march of foot traffic the effect was of indifference of a disregarded distribution
ossipon looked hurriedly both ways before stepping out into the crosscurrents but the professor was already out of sight
chapter v   the professor had turned into a street to the left and walked along with his head carried rigidly erect in a crowd whose every individual almost overtopped his stunted stature
it was vain to pretend to himself that he was not disappointed
but that was mere feeling the stoicism of his thought could not be disturbed by this or any other failure
next time or the time after next a telling stroke would be deliveredsomething really startlinga blow fit to open the first crack in the imposing front of the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society
of humble origin and with an appearance really so mean as to stand in the way of his considerable natural abilities his imagination had been fired early by the tales of men rising from the depths of poverty to positions of authority and affluence
the extreme almost ascetic purity of his thought combined with an astounding ignorance of worldly conditions had set before him a goal of power and prestige to be attained without the medium of arts graces tact wealthby sheer weight of merit alone
on that view he considered himself entitled to undisputed success
his father a delicate dark enthusiast with a sloping forehead had been an itinerant and rousing preacher of some obscure but rigid christian secta man supremely confident in the privileges of his righteousness
in the son individualist by temperament once the science of colleges had replaced thoroughly the faith of conventicles this moral attitude translated itself into a frenzied puritanism of ambition
he nursed it as something secularly holy
to see it thwarted opened his eyes to the true nature of the world whose morality was artificial corrupt and blasphemous
the way of even the most justifiable revolutions is prepared by personal impulses disguised into creeds
the professors indignation found in itself a final cause that absolved him from the sin of turning to destruction as the agent of his ambition
to destroy public faith in legality was the imperfect formula of his pedantic fanaticism but the subconscious conviction that the framework of an established social order cannot be effectually shattered except by some form of collective or individual violence was precise and correct
he was a moral agentthat was settled in his mind
by exercising his agency with ruthless defiance he procured for himself the appearances of power and personal prestige
that was undeniable to his vengeful bitterness
it pacified its unrest and in their own way the most ardent of revolutionaries are perhaps doing no more but seeking for peace in common with the rest of mankindthe peace of soothed vanity of satisfied appetites or perhaps of appeased conscience
lost in the crowd miserable and undersized he meditated confidently on his power keeping his hand in the left pocket of his trousers grasping lightly the indiarubber ball the supreme guarantee of his sinister freedom but after a while he became disagreeably affected by the sight of the roadway thronged with vehicles and of the pavement crowded with men and women
he was in a long straight street peopled by a mere fraction of an immense multitude but all round him on and on even to the limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks he felt the mass of mankind mighty in its numbers
they swarmed numerous like locusts industrious like ants thoughtless like a natural force pushing on blind and orderly and absorbed impervious to sentiment to logic to terror too perhaps
that was the form of doubt he feared most
impervious to fear
often while walking abroad when he happened also to come out of himself he had such moments of dreadful and sane mistrust of mankind
what if nothing could move them
such moments come to all men whose ambition aims at a direct grasp upon humanityto artists politicians thinkers reformers or saints
a despicable emotional state this against which solitude fortifies a superior character and with severe exultation the professor thought of the refuge of his room with its padlocked cupboard lost in a wilderness of poor houses the hermitage of the perfect anarchist
in order to reach sooner the point where he could take his omnibus he turned brusquely out of the populous street into a narrow and dusky alley paved with flagstones
on one side the low brick houses had in their dusty windows the sightless moribund look of incurable decayempty shells awaiting demolition
from the other side life had not departed wholly as yet
facing the only gaslamp yawned the cavern of a secondhand furniture dealer where deep in the gloom of a sort of narrow avenue winding through a bizarre forest of wardrobes with an undergrowth tangle of table legs a tall pierglass glimmered like a pool of water in a wood
an unhappy homeless couch accompanied by two unrelated chairs stood in the open
the only human being making use of the alley besides the professor coming stalwart and erect from the opposite direction checked his swinging pace suddenly
hallo he said and stood a little on one side watchfully
the professor had already stopped with a ready half turn which brought his shoulders very near the other wall
his right hand fell lightly on the back of the outcast couch the left remained purposefully plunged deep in the trousers pocket and the roundness of the heavy rimmed spectacles imparted an owlish character to his moody unperturbed face
it was like a meeting in a side corridor of a mansion full of life
the stalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat and carried an umbrella
his hat tilted back uncovered a good deal of forehead which appeared very white in the dusk
in the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs glimmered piercingly
long drooping moustaches the colour of ripe corn framed with their points the square block of his shaved chin
i am not looking for you he said curtly
the professor did not stir an inch
the blended noises of the enormous town sank down to an inarticulate low murmur
chief inspector heat of the special crimes department changed his tone
not in a hurry to get home he asked with mocking simplicity
the unwholesomelooking little moral agent of destruction exulted silently in the possession of personal prestige keeping in check this man armed with the defensive mandate of a menaced society
more fortunate than caligula who wished that the roman senate had only one head for the better satisfaction of his cruel lust he beheld in that one man all the forces he had set at defiance the force of law property oppression and injustice
he beheld all his enemies and fearlessly confronted them all in a supreme satisfaction of his vanity
they stood perplexed before him as if before a dreadful portent
he gloated inwardly over the chance of this meeting affirming his superiority over all the multitude of mankind
it was in reality a chance meeting
chief inspector heat had had a disagreeably busy day since his department received the first telegram from greenwich a little before eleven in the morning
first of all the fact of the outrage being attempted less than a week after he had assured a high official that no outbreak of anarchist activity was to be apprehended was sufficiently annoying
if he ever thought himself safe in making a statement it was then
he had made that statement with infinite satisfaction to himself because it was clear that the high official desired greatly to hear that very thing
he had affirmed that nothing of the sort could even be thought of without the department being aware of it within twentyfour hours and he had spoken thus in his consciousness of being the great expert of his department
he had gone even so far as to utter words which true wisdom would have kept back
but chief inspector heat was not very wiseat least not truly so
true wisdom which is not certain of anything in this world of contradictions would have prevented him from attaining his present position
it would have alarmed his superiors and done away with his chances of promotion
his promotion had been very rapid
there isnt one of them sir that we couldnt lay our hands on at any time of night and day
we know what each of them is doing hour by hour he had declared
and the high official had deigned to smile
this was so obviously the right thing to say for an officer of chief inspector heats reputation that it was perfectly delightful
the high official believed the declaration which chimed in with his idea of the fitness of things
his wisdom was of an official kind or else he might have reflected upon a matter not of theory but of experience that in the closewoven stuff of relations between conspirator and police there occur unexpected solutions of continuity sudden holes in space and time
a given anarchist may be watched inch by inch and minute by minute but a moment always comes when somehow all sight and touch of him are lost for a few hours during which something generally an explosion more or less deplorable does happen
but the high official carried away by his sense of the fitness of things had smiled and now the recollection of that smile was very annoying to chief inspector heat principal expert in anarchist procedure
this was not the only circumstance whose recollection depressed the usual serenity of the eminent specialist
there was another dating back only to that very morning
the thought that when called urgently to his assistant commissioners private room he had been unable to conceal his astonishment was distinctly vexing
his instinct of a successful man had taught him long ago that as a general rule a reputation is built on manner as much as on achievement
and he felt that his manner when confronted with the telegram had not been impressive
he had opened his eyes widely and had exclaimed impossible exposing himself thereby to the unanswerable retort of a fingertip laid forcibly on the telegram which the assistant commissioner after reading it aloud had flung on the desk
to be crushed as it were under the tip of a forefinger was an unpleasant experience
very damaging too
furthermore chief inspector heat was conscious of not having mended matters by allowing himself to express a conviction
one thing i can tell you at once none of our lot had anything to do with this  he was strong in his integrity of a good detective but he saw now that an impenetrably attentive reserve towards this incident would have served his reputation better
on the other hand he admitted to himself that it was difficult to preserve ones reputation if rank outsiders were going to take a hand in the business
outsiders are the bane of the police as of other professions
the tone of the assistant commissioners remarks had been sour enough to set ones teeth on edge
and since breakfast chief inspector heat had not managed to get anything to eat
starting immediately to begin his investigation on the spot he had swallowed a good deal of raw unwholesome fog in the park
then he had walked over to the hospital and when the investigation in greenwich was concluded at last he had lost his inclination for food
not accustomed as the doctors are to examine closely the mangled remains of human beings he had been shocked by the sight disclosed to his view when a waterproof sheet had been lifted off a table in a certain apartment of the hospital
another waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the manner of a tablecloth with the corners turned up over a sort of mounda heap of rags scorched and bloodstained half concealing what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast
it required considerable firmness of mind not to recoil before that sight
chief inspector heat an efficient officer of his department stood his ground but for a whole minute he did not advance
a local constable in uniform cast a sidelong glance and said with stolid simplicity  hes all there
every bit of him
it was a job  he had been the first man on the spot after the explosion
he mentioned the fact again
he had seen something like a heavy flash of lightning in the fog
at that time he was standing at the door of the king william street lodge talking to the keeper
the concussion made him tingle all over
he ran between the trees towards the observatory
as fast as my legs would carry me he repeated twice
chief inspector heat bending forward over the table in a gingerly and horrified manner let him run on
the hospital porter and another man turned down the corners of the cloth and stepped aside
the chief inspectors eyes searched the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed things which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops
you used a shovel he remarked observing a sprinkling of small gravel tiny brown bits of bark and particles of splintered wood as fine as needles
had to in one place said the stolid constable
i sent a keeper to fetch a spade
when he heard me scraping the ground with it he leaned his forehead against a tree and was as sick as a dog  the chief inspector stooping guardedly over the table fought down the unpleasant sensation in his throat
the shattering violence of destruction which had made of that body a heap of nameless fragments affected his feelings with a sense of ruthless cruelty though his reason told him the effect must have been as swift as a flash of lightning
the man whoever he was had died instantaneously and yet it seemed impossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony
no physiologist and still less of a metaphysician chief inspector heat rose by the force of sympathy which is a form of fear above the vulgar conception of time
instantaneous
he remembered all he had ever read in popular publications of long and terrifying dreams dreamed in the instant of waking of the whole past life lived with frightful intensity by a drowning man as his doomed head bobs up streaming for the last time
the inexplicable mysteries of conscious existence beset chief inspector heat till he evolved a horrible notion that ages of atrocious pain and mental torture could be contained between two successive winks of an eye
and meantime the chief inspector went on peering at the table with a calm face and the slightly anxious attention of an indigent customer bending over what may be called the byproducts of a butchers shop with a view to an inexpensive sunday dinner
all the time his trained faculties of an excellent investigator who scorns no chance of information followed the selfsatisfied disjointed loquacity of the constable
a fairhaired fellow the last observed in a placid tone and paused
the old woman who spoke to the sergeant noticed a fairhaired fellow coming out of maze hill station  he paused
and he was a fairhaired fellow
she noticed two men coming out of the station after the uptrain had gone on he continued slowly
she couldnt tell if they were together
she took no particular notice of the big one but the other was a fair slight chap carrying a tin varnish can in one hand  the constable ceased
know the woman muttered the chief inspector with his eyes fixed on the table and a vague notion in his mind of an inquest to be held presently upon a person likely to remain for ever unknown
yes
shes housekeeper to a retired publican and attends the chapel in park place sometimes the constable uttered weightily and paused with another oblique glance at the table
then suddenly well here he isall of him i could see
fair
slightslight enough
look at that foot there
i picked up the legs first one after another
he was that scattered you didnt know where to begin  the constable paused the least flicker of an innocent selflaudatory smile invested his round face with an infantile expression
stumbled he announced positively
i stumbled once myself and pitched on my head too while running up
them roots do stick out all about the place
stumbled against the root of a tree and fell and that thing he was carrying must have gone off right under his chest i expect  the echo of the words person unknown repeating itself in his inner consciousness bothered the chief inspector considerably
he would have liked to trace this affair back to its mysterious origin for his own information
he was professionally curious
before the public he would have liked to vindicate the efficiency of his department by establishing the identity of that man
he was a loyal servant
that however appeared impossible
the first term of the problem was unreadablelacked all suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty
overcoming his physical repugnance chief inspector heat stretched out his hand without conviction for the salving of his conscience and took up the least soiled of the rags
it was a narrow strip of velvet with a larger triangular piece of dark blue cloth hanging from it
he held it up to his eyes and the police constable spoke
velvet collar
funny the old woman should have noticed the velvet collar
dark blue overcoat with a velvet collar she has told us
he was the chap she saw and no mistake
and here he is all complete velvet collar and all
i dont think i missed a single piece as big as a postage stamp  at this point the trained faculties of the chief inspector ceased to hear the voice of the constable
he moved to one of the windows for better light
his face averted from the room expressed a startled intense interest while he examined closely the triangular piece of broadcloth
by a sudden jerk he detached it and only after stuffing it into his pocket turned round to the room and flung the velvet collar back on the table  cover up he directed the attendants curtly without another look and saluted by the constable carried off his spoil hastily
a convenient train whirled him up to town alone and pondering deeply in a thirdclass compartment
that singed piece of cloth was incredibly valuable and he could not defend himself from astonishment at the casual manner it had come into his possession
it was as if fate had thrust that clue into his hands
and after the manner of the average man whose ambition is to command events he began to mistrust such a gratuitous and accidental successjust because it seemed forced upon him
the practical value of success depends not a little on the way you look at it
but fate looks at nothing
it has no discretion
he no longer considered it eminently desirable all round to establish publicly the identity of the man who had blown himself up that morning with such horrible completeness
but he was not certain of the view his department would take
a department is to those it employs a complex personality with ideas and even fads of its own
it depends on the loyal devotion of its servants and the devoted loyalty of trusted servants is associated with a certain amount of affectionate contempt which keeps it sweet as it were
by a benevolent provision of nature no man is a hero to his valet or else the heroes would have to brush their own clothes
likewise no department appears perfectly wise to the intimacy of its workers
a department does not know so much as some of its servants
being a dispassionate organism it can never be perfectly informed
it would not be good for its efficiency to know too much
chief inspector heat got out of the train in a state of thoughtfulness entirely untainted with disloyalty but not quite free of that jealous mistrust which so often springs on the ground of perfect devotion whether to women or to institutions
it was in this mental disposition physically very empty but still nauseated by what he had seen that he had come upon the professor
under these conditions which make for irascibility in a sound normal man this meeting was specially unwelcome to chief inspector heat
he had not been thinking of the professor he had not been thinking of any individual anarchist at all
the complexion of that case had somehow forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical temperament and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond endurance
at the beginning of his career chief inspector heat had been concerned with the more energetic forms of thieving
he had gained his spurs in that sphere and naturally enough had kept for it after his promotion to another department a feeling not very far removed from affection
thieving was not a sheer absurdity
it was a form of human industry perverse indeed but still an industry exercised in an industrious world it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries in coal mines in fields in toolgrinding shops
it was labour whose practical difference from the other forms of labour consisted in the nature of its risk which did not lie in ankylosis or lead poisoning or firedamp or gritty dust but in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as seven years hard  chief inspector heat was of course not insensible to the gravity of moral differences
but neither were the thieves he had been looking after
they submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to chief inspector heat with a certain resignation
they were his fellowcitizens gone wrong because of imperfect education chief inspector heat believed but allowing for that difference he could understand the mind of a burglar because as a matter of fact the mind and the instincts of a burglar are of the same kind as the mind and the instincts of a police officer
both recognise the same conventions and have a working knowledge of each others methods and of the routine of their respective trades
they understand each other which is advantageous to both and establishes a sort of amenity in their relations
products of the same machine one classed as useful and the other as noxious they take the machine for granted in different ways but with a seriousness essentially the same
the mind of chief inspector heat was inaccessible to ideas of revolt
but his thieves were not rebels
his bodily vigour his cool inflexible manner his courage and his fairness had secured for him much respect and some adulation in the sphere of his early successes
he had felt himself revered and admired
and chief inspector heat arrested within six paces of the anarchist nicknamed the professor gave a thought of regret to the world of thievessane without morbid ideals working by routine respectful of constituted authorities free from all taint of hate and despair
after paying this tribute to what is normal in the constitution of society for the idea of thieving appeared to his instinct as normal as the idea of property chief inspector heat felt very angry with himself for having stopped for having spoken for having taken that way at all on the ground of it being a short cut from the station to the headquarters
and he spoke again in his big authoritative voice which being moderated had a threatening character
you are not wanted i tell you he repeated
the anarchist did not stir
an inward laugh of derision uncovered not only his teeth but his gums as well shook him all over without the slightest sound
chief inspector heat was led to add against his better judgment  not yet
when i want you i will know where to find you  those were perfectly proper words within the tradition and suitable to his character of a police officer addressing one of his special flock
but the reception they got departed from tradition and propriety
it was outrageous
the stunted weakly figure before him spoke at last
ive no doubt the papers would give you an obituary notice then
you know best what that would be worth to you
i should think you can imagine easily the sort of stuff that would be printed
but you may be exposed to the unpleasantness of being buried together with me though i suppose your friends would make an effort to sort us out as much as possible  with all his healthy contempt for the spirit dictating such speeches the atrocious allusiveness of the words had its effect on chief inspector heat
he had too much insight and too much exact information as well to dismiss them as rot
the dusk of this narrow lane took on a sinister tint from the dark frail little figure its back to the wall and speaking with a weak selfconfident voice
to the vigorous tenacious vitality of the chief inspector the physical wretchedness of that being so obviously not fit to live was ominous for it seemed to him that if he had the misfortune to be such a miserable object he would not have cared how soon he died
life had such a strong hold upon him that a fresh wave of nausea broke out in slight perspiration upon his brow
the murmur of town life the subdued rumble of wheels in the two invisible streets to the right and left came through the curve of the sordid lane to his ears with a precious familiarity and an appealing sweetness
he was human
but chief inspector heat was also a man and he could not let such words pass
all this is good to frighten children with he said
ill have you yet  it was very well said without scorn with an almost austere quietness
doubtless was the answer but theres no time like the present believe me
for a man of real convictions this is a fine opportunity of selfsacrifice
you may not find another so favourable so humane
there isnt even a cat near us and these condemned old houses would make a good heap of bricks where you stand
youll never get me at so little cost to life and property which you are paid to protect  you dont know who youre speaking to said chief inspector heat firmly
if i were to lay my hands on you now i would be no better than yourself  ah
the game  you may be sure our side will win in the end
it may yet be necessary to make people believe that some of you ought to be shot at sight like mad dogs
then that will be the game
but ill be damned if i know what yours is
i dont believe you know yourselves
youll never get anything by it  meantime its you who get something from itso far
and you get it easily too
i wont speak of your salary but havent you made your name simply by not understanding what we are after  what are you after then asked chief inspector heat with scornful haste like a man in a hurry who perceives he is wasting his time
the perfect anarchist answered by a smile which did not part his thin colourless lips and the celebrated chief inspector felt a sense of superiority which induced him to raise a warning finger
give it upwhatever it is he said in an admonishing tone but not so kindly as if he were condescending to give good advice to a cracksman of repute
give it up
youll find we are too many for you  the fixed smile on the professors lips wavered as if the mocking spirit within had lost its assurance
chief inspector heat went on  dont you believe me eh
well youve only got to look about you
we are
and anyway youre not doing it well
youre always making a mess of it
why if the thieves didnt know their work better they would starve  the hint of an invincible multitude behind that mans back roused a sombre indignation in the breast of the professor
he smiled no longer his enigmatic and mocking smile
the resisting power of numbers the unattackable stolidity of a great multitude was the haunting fear of his sinister loneliness
his lips trembled for some time before he managed to say in a strangled voice  i am doing my work better than youre doing yours  thatll do now interrupted chief inspector heat hurriedly and the professor laughed right out this time
while still laughing he moved on but he did not laugh long
it was a sadfaced miserable little man who emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad thoroughfare
he walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on still going on indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth
chief inspector heat on the other hand after watching him for a while stepped out with the purposeful briskness of a man disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather but conscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the moral support of his kind
all the inhabitants of the immense town the population of the whole country and even the teeming millions struggling upon the planet were with himdown to the very thieves and mendicants
yes the thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present work
the consciousness of universal support in his general activity heartened him to grapple with the particular problem
the problem immediately before the chief inspector was that of managing the assistant commissioner of his department his immediate superior
this is the perennial problem of trusty and loyal servants anarchism gave it its particular complexion but nothing more
truth to say chief inspector heat thought but little of anarchism
he did not attach undue importance to it and could never bring himself to consider it seriously
it had more the character of disorderly conduct disorderly without the human excuse of drunkenness which at any rate implies good feeling and an amiable leaning towards festivity
as criminals anarchists were distinctly no classno class at all
and recalling the professor chief inspector heat without checking his swinging pace muttered through his teeth  lunatic  catching thieves was another matter altogether
it had that quality of seriousness belonging to every form of open sport where the best man wins under perfectly comprehensible rules
there were no rules for dealing with anarchists
and that was distasteful to the chief inspector
it was all foolishness but that foolishness excited the public mind affected persons in high places and touched upon international relations
a hard merciless contempt settled rigidly on the chief inspectors face as he walked on
his mind ran over all the anarchists of his flock
not one of them had half the spunk of this or that burglar he had known
not halfnot onetenth
at headquarters the chief inspector was admitted at once to the assistant commissioners private room
he found him pen in hand bent over a great table bestrewn with papers as if worshipping an enormous double inkstand of bronze and crystal
speaking tubes resembling snakes were tied by the heads to the back of the assistant commissioners wooden armchair and their gaping mouths seemed ready to bite his elbows
and in this attitude he raised only his eyes whose lids were darker than his face and very much creased
the reports had come in every anarchist had been exactly accounted for
after saying this he lowered his eyes signed rapidly two single sheets of paper and only then laid down his pen and sat well back directing an inquiring gaze at his renowned subordinate
the chief inspector stood it well deferential but inscrutable
i daresay you were right said the assistant commissioner in telling me at first that the london anarchists had nothing to do with this
i quite appreciate the excellent watch kept on them by your men
on the other hand this for the public does not amount to more than a confession of ignorance  the assistant commissioners delivery was leisurely as it were cautious
his thought seemed to rest poised on a word before passing to another as though words had been the steppingstones for his intellect picking its way across the waters of error
unless you have brought something useful from greenwich he added
the chief inspector began at once the account of his investigation in a clear matteroffact manner
his superior turning his chair a little and crossing his thin legs leaned sideways on his elbow with one hand shading his eyes
his listening attitude had a sort of angular and sorrowful grace
gleams as of highly burnished silver played on the sides of his ebony black head when he inclined it slowly at the end
chief inspector heat waited with the appearance of turning over in his mind all he had just said but as a matter of fact considering the advisability of saying something more
the assistant commissioner cut his hesitation short
you believe there were two men he asked without uncovering his eyes
the chief inspector thought it more than probable
in his opinion the two men had parted from each other within a hundred yards from the observatory walls
he explained also how the other man could have got out of the park speedily without being observed
the fog though not very dense was in his favour
he seemed to have escorted the other to the spot and then to have left him there to do the job singlehanded
taking the time those two were seen coming out of maze hill station by the old woman and the time when the explosion was heard the chief inspector thought that the other man might have been actually at the greenwich park station ready to catch the next train up at the moment his comrade was destroying himself so thoroughly
very thoroughlyeh murmured the assistant commissioner from under the shadow of his hand
the chief inspector in a few vigorous words described the aspect of the remains
the coroners jury will have a treat he added grimly
the assistant commissioner uncovered his eyes
we shall have nothing to tell them he remarked languidly
he looked up and for a time watched the markedly noncommittal attitude of his chief inspector
his nature was one that is not easily accessible to illusions
he knew that a department is at the mercy of its subordinate officers who have their own conceptions of loyalty
his career had begun in a tropical colony
he had liked his work there
it was police work
he had been very successful in tracking and breaking up certain nefarious secret societies amongst the natives
then he took his long leave and got married rather impulsively
it was a good match from a worldly point of view but his wife formed an unfavourable opinion of the colonial climate on hearsay evidence
on the other hand she had influential connections
it was an excellent match
but he did not like the work he had to do now
he felt himself dependent on too many subordinates and too many masters
the near presence of that strange emotional phenomenon called public opinion weighed upon his spirits and alarmed him by its irrational nature
no doubt that from ignorance he exaggerated to himself its power for good and evilespecially for evil and the rough east winds of the english spring which agreed with his wife augmented his general mistrust of mens motives and of the efficiency of their organisation
the futility of office work especially appalled him on those days so trying to his sensitive liver
he got up unfolding himself to his full height and with a heaviness of step remarkable in so slender a man moved across the room to the window
the panes streamed with rain and the short street he looked down into lay wet and empty as if swept clear suddenly by a great flood
it was a very trying day choked in raw fog to begin with and now drowned in cold rain
the flickering blurred flames of gaslamps seemed to be dissolving in a watery atmosphere
and the lofty pretensions of a mankind oppressed by the miserable indignities of the weather appeared as a colossal and hopeless vanity deserving of scorn wonder and compassion
horrible horrible thought the assistant commissioner to himself with his face near the windowpane
we have been having this sort of thing now for ten days no a fortnighta fortnight  he ceased to think completely for a time
that utter stillness of his brain lasted about three seconds
then he said perfunctorily you have set inquiries on foot for tracing that other man up and down the line  he had no doubt that everything needful had been done
chief inspector heat knew of course thoroughly the business of manhunting
and these were the routine steps too that would be taken as a matter of course by the merest beginner
a few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and the porters of the two small railway stations would give additional details as to the appearance of the two men the inspection of the collected tickets would show at once where they came from that morning
it was elementary and could not have been neglected
accordingly the chief inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had come forward with her deposition
and he mentioned the name of a station
thats where they came from sir he went on
the porter who took the tickets at maze hill remembers two chaps answering to the description passing the barrier
they seemed to him two respectable working men of a superior sortsign painters or house decorators
the big man got out of a thirdclass compartment backward with a bright tin can in his hand
on the platform he gave it to carry to the fair young fellow who followed him
all this agrees exactly with what the old woman told the police sergeant in greenwich  the assistant commissioner still with his face turned to the window expressed his doubt as to these two men having had anything to do with the outrage
all this theory rested upon the utterances of an old charwoman who had been nearly knocked down by a man in a hurry
not a very substantial authority indeed unless on the ground of sudden inspiration which was hardly tenable
frankly now could she have been really inspired he queried with grave irony keeping his back to the room as if entranced by the contemplation of the towns colossal forms half lost in the night
he did not even look round when he heard the mutter of the word providential from the principal subordinate of his department whose name printed sometimes in the papers was familiar to the great public as that of one of its zealous and hardworking protectors
chief inspector heat raised his voice a little
strips and bits of bright tin were quite visible to me he said
thats a pretty good corroboration  and these men came from that little country station the assistant commissioner mused aloud wondering
he was told that such was the name on two tickets out of three given up out of that train at maze hill
the third person who got out was a hawker from gravesend well known to the porters
the chief inspector imparted that information in a tone of finality with some ill humour as loyal servants will do in the consciousness of their fidelity and with the sense of the value of their loyal exertions
and still the assistant commissioner did not turn away from the darkness outside as vast as a sea
two foreign anarchists coming from that place he said apparently to the windowpane
its rather unaccountable  yes sir
but it would be still more unaccountable if that michaelis werent staying in a cottage in the neighbourhood  at the sound of that name falling unexpectedly into this annoying affair the assistant commissioner dismissed brusquely the vague remembrance of his daily whist party at his club
it was the most comforting habit of his life in a mainly successful display of his skill without the assistance of any subordinate
he entered his club to play from five to seven before going home to dinner forgetting for those two hours whatever was distasteful in his life as though the game were a beneficent drug for allaying the pangs of moral discontent
his partners were the gloomily humorous editor of a celebrated magazine a silent elderly barrister with malicious little eyes and a highly martial simpleminded old colonel with nervous brown hands
they were his club acquaintances merely
he never met them elsewhere except at the cardtable
but they all seemed to approach the game in the spirit of cosufferers as if it were indeed a drug against the secret ills of existence and every day as the sun declined over the countless roofs of the town a mellow pleasurable impatience resembling the impulse of a sure and profound friendship lightened his professional labours
and now this pleasurable sensation went out of him with something resembling a physical shock and was replaced by a special kind of interest in his work of social protectionan improper sort of interest which may be defined best as a sudden and alert mistrust of the weapon in his hand
chapter vi   the lady patroness of michaelis the ticketofleave apostle of humanitarian hopes was one of the most influential and distinguished connections of the assistant commissioners wife whom she called annie and treated still rather as a not very wise and utterly inexperienced young girl
but she had consented to accept him on a friendly footing which was by no means the case with all of his wifes influential connections
married young and splendidly at some remote epoch of the past she had had for a time a close view of great affairs and even of some great men
she herself was a great lady
old now in the number of her years she had that sort of exceptional temperament which defies time with scornful disregard as if it were a rather vulgar convention submitted to by the mass of inferior mankind
many other conventions easier to set aside alas
failed to obtain her recognition also on temperamental groundseither because they bored her or else because they stood in the way of her scorns and sympathies
admiration was a sentiment unknown to her it was one of the secret griefs of her most noble husband against herfirst as always more or less tainted with mediocrity and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority
and both were frankly inconceivable to her nature
to be fearlessly outspoken in her opinions came easily to her since she judged solely from the standpoint of her social position
she was equally untrammelled in her actions and as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity her bodily vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and cordial three generations had admired her infinitely and the last she was likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful woman
meantime intelligent with a sort of lofty simplicity and curious at heart but not like many women merely of social gossip she amused her age by attracting within her ken through the power of her great almost historical social prestige everything that rose above the dead level of mankind lawfully or unlawfully by position wit audacity fortune or misfortune
royal highnesses artists men of science young statesmen and charlatans of all ages and conditions who unsubstantial and light bobbing up like corks show best the direction of the surface currents had been welcomed in that house listened to penetrated understood appraised for her own edification
in her own words she liked to watch what the world was coming to
and as she had a practical mind her judgment of men and things though based on special prejudices was seldom totally wrong and almost never wrongheaded
her drawingroom was probably the only place in the wide world where an assistant commissioner of police could meet a convict liberated on a ticketofleave on other than professional and official ground
who had brought michaelis there one afternoon the assistant commissioner did not remember very well
he had a notion it must have been a certain member of parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional sympathies which were the standing joke of the comic papers
the notabilities and even the simple notorieties of the day brought each other freely to that temple of an old womans not ignoble curiosity
you never could guess whom you were likely to come upon being received in semiprivacy within the faded blue silk and gilt frame screen making a cosy nook for a couch and a few armchairs in the great drawingroom with its hum of voices and the groups of people seated or standing in the light of six tall windows
michaelis had been the object of a revulsion of popular sentiment the same sentiment which years ago had applauded the ferocity of the life sentence passed upon him for complicity in a rather mad attempt to rescue some prisoners from a police van
the plan of the conspirators had been to shoot down the horses and overpower the escort
unfortunately one of the police constables got shot too
he left a wife and three small children and the death of that man aroused through the length and breadth of a realm for whose defence welfare and glory men die every day as matter of duty an outburst of furious indignation of a raging implacable pity for the victim
three ringleaders got hanged
michaelis young and slim locksmith by trade and great frequenter of evening schools did not even know that anybody had been killed his part with a few others being to force open the door at the back of the special conveyance
when arrested he had a bunch of skeleton keys in one pocket a heavy chisel in another and a short crowbar in his hand neither more nor less than a burglar
but no burglar would have received such a heavy sentence
the death of the constable had made him miserable at heart but the failure of the plot also
he did not conceal either of these sentiments from his empanelled countrymen and that sort of compunction appeared shockingly imperfect to the crammed court
the judge on passing sentence commented feelingly upon the depravity and callousness of the young prisoner
that made the groundless fame of his condemnation the fame of his release was made for him on no better grounds by people who wished to exploit the sentimental aspect of his imprisonment either for purposes of their own or for no intelligible purpose
he let them do so in the innocence of his heart and the simplicity of his mind
nothing that happened to him individually had any importance
he was like those saintly men whose personality is lost in the contemplation of their faith
his ideas were not in the nature of convictions
they were inaccessible to reasoning
they formed in all their contradictions and obscurities an invincible and humanitarian creed which he confessed rather than preached with an obstinate gentleness a smile of pacific assurance on his lips and his candid blue eyes cast down because the sight of faces troubled his inspiration developed in solitude
in that characteristic attitude pathetic in his grotesque and incurable obesity which he had to drag like a galley slaves bullet to the end of his days the assistant commissioner of police beheld the ticketofleave apostle filling a privileged armchair within the screen
he sat there by the head of the old ladys couch mildvoiced and quiet with no more selfconsciousness than a very small child and with something of a childs charmthe appealing charm of trustfulness
confident of the future whose secret ways had been revealed to him within the four walls of a wellknown penitentiary he had no reason to look with suspicion upon anybody
if he could not give the great and curious lady a very definite idea as to what the world was coming to he had managed without effort to impress her by his unembittered faith by the sterling quality of his optimism
a certain simplicity of thought is common to serene souls at both ends of the social scale
the great lady was simple in her own way
his views and beliefs had nothing in them to shock or startle her since she judged them from the standpoint of her lofty position
indeed her sympathies were easily accessible to a man of that sort
she was not an exploiting capitalist herself she was as it were above the play of economic conditions
and she had a great capacity of pity for the more obvious forms of common human miseries precisely because she was such a complete stranger to them that she had to translate her conception into terms of mental suffering before she could grasp the notion of their cruelty
the assistant commissioner remembered very well the conversation between these two
he had listened in silence
it was something as exciting in a way and even touching in its foredoomed futility as the efforts at moral intercourse between the inhabitants of remote planets
but this grotesque incarnation of humanitarian passion appealed somehow to ones imagination
at last michaelis rose and taking the great ladys extended hand shook it retained it for a moment in his great cushioned palm with unembarrassed friendliness and turned upon the semiprivate nook of the drawingroom his back vast and square and as if distended under the short tweed jacket
glancing about in serene benevolence he waddled along to the distant door between the knots of other visitors
the murmur of conversations paused on his passage
he smiled innocently at a tall brilliant girl whose eyes met his accidentally and went out unconscious of the glances following him across the room
michaelis first appearance in the world was a successa success of esteem unmarred by a single murmur of derision
the interrupted conversations were resumed in their proper tone grave or light
only a wellsetup longlimbed activelooking man of forty talking with two ladies near a window remarked aloud with an unexpected depth of feeling eighteen stone i should say and not five foot six
poor fellow
its terribleterrible  the lady of the house gazing absently at the assistant commissioner left alone with her on the private side of the screen seemed to be rearranging her mental impressions behind her thoughtful immobility of a handsome old face
men with grey moustaches and full healthy vaguely smiling countenances approached circling round the screen two mature women with a matronly air of gracious resolution a cleanshaved individual with sunken cheeks and dangling a goldmounted eyeglass on a broad black ribbon with an oldworld dandified effect
a silence deferential but full of reserves reigned for a moment and then the great lady exclaimed not with resentment but with a sort of protesting indignation  and that officially is supposed to be a revolutionist
what nonsense she looked hard at the assistant commissioner who murmured apologetically  not a dangerous one perhaps  not dangerousi should think not indeed
he is a mere believer
its the temperament of a saint declared the great lady in a firm tone
and they kept him shut up for twenty years
one shudders at the stupidity of it
and now they have let him out everybody belonging to him is gone away somewhere or dead
his parents are dead the girl he was to marry has died while he was in prison he has lost the skill necessary for his manual occupation
he told me all this himself with the sweetest patience but then he said he had had plenty of time to think out things for himself
a pretty compensation
if thats the stuff revolutionists are made of some of us may well go on their knees to them she continued in a slightly bantering voice while the banal society smiles hardened on the worldly faces turned towards her with conventional deference
the poor creature is obviously no longer in a position to take care of himself
somebody will have to look after him a little  he should be recommended to follow a treatment of some sort the soldierly voice of the activelooking man was heard advising earnestly from a distance
he was in the pink of condition for his age and even the texture of his long frock coat had a character of elastic soundness as if it were a living tissue
the man is virtually a cripple he added with unmistakable feeling
other voices as if glad of the opening murmured hasty compassion
quite startling monstrous most painful to see  the lank man with the eyeglass on a broad ribbon pronounced mincingly the word grotesque whose justness was appreciated by those standing near him
they smiled at each other
the assistant commissioner had expressed no opinion either then or later his position making it impossible for him to ventilate any independent view of a ticketofleave convict
but in truth he shared the view of his wifes friend and patron that michaelis was a humanitarian sentimentalist a little mad but upon the whole incapable of hurting a fly intentionally
so when that name cropped up suddenly in this vexing bomb affair he realised all the danger of it for the ticketofleave apostle and his mind reverted at once to the old ladys wellestablished infatuation
her arbitrary kindness would not brook patiently any interference with michaelis freedom
it was a deep calm convinced infatuation
she had not only felt him to be inoffensive but she had said so which last by a confusion of her absolutist mind became a sort of incontrovertible demonstration
it was as if the monstrosity of the man with his candid infants eyes and a fat angelic smile had fascinated her
she had come to believe almost his theory of the future since it was not repugnant to her prejudices
she disliked the new element of plutocracy in the social compound and industrialism as a method of human development appeared to her singularly repulsive in its mechanical and unfeeling character
the humanitarian hopes of the mild michaelis tended not towards utter destruction but merely towards the complete economic ruin of the system
and she did not really see where was the moral harm of it
it would do away with all the multitude of the parvenus whom she disliked and mistrusted not because they had arrived anywhere she denied that but because of their profound unintelligence of the world which was the primary cause of the crudity of their perceptions and the aridity of their hearts
with the annihilation of all capital they would vanish too but universal ruin providing it was universal as it was revealed to michaelis would leave the social values untouched
the disappearance of the last piece of money could not affect people of position
she could not conceive how it could affect her position for instance
she had developed these discoveries to the assistant commissioner with all the serene fearlessness of an old woman who had escaped the blight of indifference
he had made for himself the rule to receive everything of that sort in a silence which he took care from policy and inclination not to make offensive
he had an affection for the aged disciple of michaelis a complex sentiment depending a little on her prestige on her personality but most of all on the instinct of flattered gratitude
he felt himself really liked in her house
she was kindness personified
and she was practically wise too after the manner of experienced women
she made his married life much easier than it would have been without her generously full recognition of his rights as annies husband
her influence upon his wife a woman devoured by all sorts of small selfishnesses small envies small jealousies was excellent
unfortunately both her kindness and her wisdom were of unreasonable complexion distinctly feminine and difficult to deal with
she remained a perfect woman all along her full tale of years and not as some of them do becomea sort of slippery pestilential old man in petticoats
and it was as of a woman that he thought of herthe specially choice incarnation of the feminine wherein is recruited the tender ingenuous and fierce bodyguard for all sorts of men who talk under the influence of an emotion true or fraudulent for preachers seers prophets or reformers
appreciating the distinguished and good friend of his wife and himself in that way the assistant commissioner became alarmed at the convict michaelis possible fate
once arrested on suspicion of being in some way however remote a party to this outrage the man could hardly escape being sent back to finish his sentence at least
and that would kill him he would never come out alive
the assistant commissioner made a reflection extremely unbecoming his official position without being really creditable to his humanity
if the fellow is laid hold of again he thought she will never forgive me  the frankness of such a secretly outspoken thought could not go without some derisive selfcriticism
no man engaged in a work he does not like can preserve many saving illusions about himself
the distaste the absence of glamour extend from the occupation to the personality
it is only when our appointed activities seem by a lucky accident to obey the particular earnestness of our temperament that we can taste the comfort of complete selfdeception
the assistant commissioner did not like his work at home
the police work he had been engaged on in a distant part of the globe had the saving character of an irregular sort of warfare or at least the risk and excitement of openair sport
his real abilities which were mainly of an administrative order were combined with an adventurous disposition
chained to a desk in the thick of four millions of men he considered himself the victim of an ironic fatethe same no doubt which had brought about his marriage with a woman exceptionally sensitive in the matter of colonial climate besides other limitations testifying to the delicacy of her natureand her tastes
though he judged his alarm sardonically he did not dismiss the improper thought from his mind
the instinct of selfpreservation was strong within him
on the contrary he repeated it mentally with profane emphasis and a fuller precision damn it
if that infernal heat has his way the fellowll die in prison smothered in his fat and shell never forgive me  his black narrow figure with the white band of the collar under the silvery gleams on the closecropped hair at the back of the head remained motionless
the silence had lasted such a long time that chief inspector heat ventured to clear his throat
this noise produced its effect
the zealous and intelligent officer was asked by his superior whose back remained turned to him immovably  you connect michaelis with this affair  chief inspector heat was very positive but cautious
well sir he said we have enough to go upon
a man like that has no business to be at large anyhow  you will want some conclusive evidence came the observation in a murmur
chief inspector heat raised his eyebrows at the black narrow back which remained obstinately presented to his intelligence and his zeal
there will be no difficulty in getting up sufficient evidence against him he said with virtuous complacency
you may trust me for that sir he added quite unnecessarily out of the fulness of his heart for it seemed to him an excellent thing to have that man in hand to be thrown down to the public should it think fit to roar with any special indignation in this case
it was impossible to say yet whether it would roar or not
that in the last instance depended of course on the newspaper press
but in any case chief inspector heat purveyor of prisons by trade and a man of legal instincts did logically believe that incarceration was the proper fate for every declared enemy of the law
in the strength of that conviction he committed a fault of tact
he allowed himself a little conceited laugh and repeated  trust me for that sir  this was too much for the forced calmness under which the assistant commissioner had for upwards of eighteen months concealed his irritation with the system and the subordinates of his office
a square peg forced into a round hole he had felt like a daily outrage that long established smooth roundness into which a man of less sharply angular shape would have fitted himself with voluptuous acquiescence after a shrug or two
what he resented most was just the necessity of taking so much on trust
at the little laugh of chief inspector heats he spun swiftly on his heels as if whirled away from the windowpane by an electric shock
he caught on the latters face not only the complacency proper to the occasion lurking under the moustache but the vestiges of experimental watchfulness in the round eyes which had been no doubt fastened on his back and now met his glance for a second before the intent character of their stare had the time to change to a merely startled appearance
the assistant commissioner of police had really some qualifications for his post
suddenly his suspicion was awakened
it is but fair to say that his suspicions of the police methods unless the police happened to be a semimilitary body organised by himself was not difficult to arouse
if it ever slumbered from sheer weariness it was but lightly and his appreciation of chief inspector heats zeal and ability moderate in itself excluded all notion of moral confidence
hes up to something he exclaimed mentally and at once became angry
crossing over to his desk with headlong strides he sat down violently
here i am stuck in a litter of paper he reflected with unreasonable resentment supposed to hold all the threads in my hands and yet i can but hold what is put in my hand and nothing else
and they can fasten the other ends of the threads where they please  he raised his head and turned towards his subordinate a long meagre face with the accentuated features of an energetic don quixote
now what is it youve got up your sleeve  the other stared
he stared without winking in a perfect immobility of his round eyes as he was used to stare at the various members of the criminal class when after being duly cautioned they made their statements in the tones of injured innocence or false simplicity or sullen resignation
but behind that professional and stony fixity there was some surprise too for in such a tone combining nicely the note of contempt and impatience chief inspector heat the righthand man of the department was not used to be addressed
he began in a procrastinating manner like a man taken unawares by a new and unexpected experience
what ive got against that man michaelis you mean sir  the assistant commissioner watched the bullet head the points of that norse rovers moustache falling below the line of the heavy jaw the whole full and pale physiognomy whose determined character was marred by too much flesh at the cunning wrinkles radiating from the outer corners of the eyesand in that purposeful contemplation of the valuable and trusted officer he drew a conviction so sudden that it moved him like an inspiration
i have reason to think that when you came into this room he said in measured tones it was not michaelis who was in your mind not principallyperhaps not at all  you have reason to think sir muttered chief inspector heat with every appearance of astonishment which up to a certain point was genuine enough
he had discovered in this affair a delicate and perplexing side forcing upon the discoverer a certain amount of insinceritythat sort of insincerity which under the names of skill prudence discretion turns up at one point or another in most human affairs
he felt at the moment like a tightrope artist might feel if suddenly in the middle of the performance the manager of the music hall were to rush out of the proper managerial seclusion and begin to shake the rope
indignation the sense of moral insecurity engendered by such a treacherous proceeding joined to the immediate apprehension of a broken neck would in the colloquial phrase put him in a state
and there would be also some scandalised concern for his art too since a man must identify himself with something more tangible than his own personality and establish his pride somewhere either in his social position or in the quality of the work he is obliged to do or simply in the superiority of the idleness he may be fortunate enough to enjoy
yes said the assistant commissioner i have
i do not mean to say that you have not thought of michaelis at all
but you are giving the fact youve mentioned a prominence which strikes me as not quite candid inspector heat
if that is really the track of discovery why havent you followed it up at once either personally or by sending one of your men to that village  do you think sir i have failed in my duty there the chief inspector asked in a tone which he sought to make simply reflective
forced unexpectedly to concentrate his faculties upon the task of preserving his balance he had seized upon that point and exposed himself to a rebuke for the assistant commissioner frowning slightly observed that this was a very improper remark to make
but since youve made it he continued coldly ill tell you that this is not my meaning  he paused with a straight glance of his sunken eyes which was a full equivalent of the unspoken termination and you know it  the head of the socalled special crimes department debarred by his position from going out of doors personally in quest of secrets locked up in guilty breasts had a propensity to exercise his considerable gifts for the detection of incriminating truth upon his own subordinates
that peculiar instinct could hardly be called a weakness
it was natural
he was a born detective
it had unconsciously governed his choice of a career and if it ever failed him in life it was perhaps in the one exceptional circumstance of his marriagewhich was also natural
it fed since it could not roam abroad upon the human material which was brought to it in its official seclusion
we can never cease to be ourselves
his elbow on the desk his thin legs crossed and nursing his cheek in the palm of his meagre hand the assistant commissioner in charge of the special crimes branch was getting hold of the case with growing interest
his chief inspector if not an absolutely worthy foeman of his penetration was at any rate the most worthy of all within his reach
a mistrust of established reputations was strictly in character with the assistant commissioners ability as detector
his memory evoked a certain old fat and wealthy native chief in the distant colony whom it was a tradition for the successive colonial governors to trust and make much of as a firm friend and supporter of the order and legality established by white men whereas when examined sceptically he was found out to be principally his own good friend and nobody elses
not precisely a traitor but still a man of many dangerous reservations in his fidelity caused by a due regard for his own advantage comfort and safety
a fellow of some innocence in his naive duplicity but none the less dangerous
he took some finding out
he was physically a big man too and allowing for the difference of colour of course chief inspector heats appearance recalled him to the memory of his superior
it was not the eyes nor yet the lips exactly
it was bizarre
but does not alfred wallace relate in his famous book on the malay archipelago how amongst the aru islanders he discovered in an old and naked savage with a sooty skin a peculiar resemblance to a dear friend at home
for the first time since he took up his appointment the assistant commissioner felt as if he were going to do some real work for his salary
and that was a pleasurable sensation
ill turn him inside out like an old glove thought the assistant commissioner with his eyes resting pensively upon chief inspector heat
no that was not my thought he began again
there is no doubt about you knowing your businessno doubt at all and thats precisely why i he stopped short and changing his tone what could you bring up against michaelis of a definite nature
i mean apart from the fact that the two men under suspicionyoure certain there were two of themcame last from a railway station within three miles of the village where michaelis is living now  this by itself is enough for us to go upon sir with that sort of man said the chief inspector with returning composure
the slight approving movement of the assistant commissioners head went far to pacify the resentful astonishment of the renowned officer
for chief inspector heat was a kind man an excellent husband a devoted father and the public and departmental confidence he enjoyed acting favourably upon an amiable nature disposed him to feel friendly towards the successive assistant commissioners he had seen pass through that very room
there had been three in his time
the first one a soldierly abrupt redfaced person with white eyebrows and an explosive temper could be managed with a silken thread
he left on reaching the age limit
the second a perfect gentleman knowing his own and everybody elses place to a nicety on resigning to take up a higher appointment out of england got decorated for really inspector heats services
to work with him had been a pride and a pleasure
the third a bit of a dark horse from the first was at the end of eighteen months something of a dark horse still to the department
upon the whole chief inspector heat believed him to be in the main harmlessoddlooking but harmless
he was speaking now and the chief inspector listened with outward deference which means nothing being a matter of duty and inwardly with benevolent toleration
michaelis reported himself before leaving london for the country  yes sir
he did  and what may he be doing there continued the assistant commissioner who was perfectly informed on that point
fitted with painful tightness into an old wooden armchair before a wormeaten oak table in an upstairs room of a fourroomed cottage with a roof of mossgrown tiles michaelis was writing night and day in a shaky slanting hand that autobiography of a prisoner which was to be like a book of revelation in the history of mankind
the conditions of confined space seclusion and solitude in a small fourroomed cottage were favourable to his inspiration
it was like being in prison except that one was never disturbed for the odious purpose of taking exercise according to the tyrannical regulations of his old home in the penitentiary
he could not tell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not
the perspiration of the literary labour dropped from his brow
a delightful enthusiasm urged him on
it was the liberation of his inner life the letting out of his soul into the wide world
and the zeal of his guileless vanity first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a publisher seemed something predestined and holy
it would be of course most desirable to be informed exactly insisted the assistant commissioner uncandidly
chief inspector heat conscious of renewed irritation at this display of scrupulousness said that the county police had been notified from the first of michaelis arrival and that a full report could be obtained in a few hours
a wire to the superintendent  thus he spoke rather slowly while his mind seemed already to be weighing the consequences
a slight knitting of the brow was the outward sign of this
but he was interrupted by a question
youve sent that wire already  no sir he answered as if surprised
the assistant commissioner uncrossed his legs suddenly
the briskness of that movement contrasted with the casual way in which he threw out a suggestion
would you think that michaelis had anything to do with the preparation of that bomb for instance  the chief inspector assumed a reflective manner
i wouldnt say so
theres no necessity to say anything at present
he associates with men who are classed as dangerous
he was made a delegate of the red committee less than a year after his release on licence
a sort of compliment i suppose  and the chief inspector laughed a little angrily a little scornfully
with a man of that sort scrupulousness was a misplaced and even an illegal sentiment
the celebrity bestowed upon michaelis on his release two years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever since in his breast
it was perfectly legal to arrest that man on the barest suspicion
it was legal and expedient on the face of it
his two former chiefs would have seen the point at once whereas this one without saying either yes or no sat there as if lost in a dream
moreover besides being legal and expedient the arrest of michaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried chief inspector heat somewhat
this difficulty had its bearing upon his reputation upon his comfort and even upon the efficient performance of his duties
for if michaelis no doubt knew something about this outrage the chief inspector was fairly certain that he did not know too much
this was just as well
he knew much lessthe chief inspector was positivethan certain other individuals he had in his mind but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient besides being a more complicated matter on account of the rules of the game
the rules of the game did not protect so much michaelis who was an exconvict
it would be stupid not to take advantage of legal facilities and the journalists who had written him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional indignation
this prospect viewed with confidence had the attraction of a personal triumph for chief inspector heat
and deep down in his blameless bosom of an average married citizen almost unconscious but potent nevertheless the dislike of being compelled by events to meddle with the desperate ferocity of the professor had its say
this dislike had been strengthened by the chance meeting in the lane
the encounter did not leave behind with chief inspector heat that satisfactory sense of superiority the members of the police force get from the unofficial but intimate side of their intercourse with the criminal classes by which the vanity of power is soothed and the vulgar love of domination over our fellowcreatures is flattered as worthily as it deserves
the perfect anarchist was not recognised as a fellowcreature by chief inspector heat
he was impossiblea mad dog to be left alone
not that the chief inspector was afraid of him on the contrary he meant to have him some day
but not yet he meant to get hold of him in his own time properly and effectively according to the rules of the game
the present was not the right time for attempting that feat not the right time for many reasons personal and of public service
this being the strong feeling of inspector heat it appeared to him just and proper that this affair should be shunted off its obscure and inconvenient track leading goodness knows where into a quiet and lawful siding called michaelis
and he repeated as if reconsidering the suggestion conscientiously  the bomb
no i would not say that exactly
we may never find that out
but its clear that he is connected with this in some way which we can find out without much trouble  his countenance had that look of grave overbearing indifference once well known and much dreaded by the better sort of thieves
chief inspector heat though what is called a man was not a smiling animal
but his inward state was that of satisfaction at the passively receptive attitude of the assistant commissioner who murmured gently  and you really think that the investigation should be made in that direction  i do sir  quite convinced
i am sir
thats the true line for us to take  the assistant commissioner withdrew the support of his hand from his reclining head with a suddenness that considering his languid attitude seemed to menace his whole person with collapse
but on the contrary he sat up extremely alert behind the great writingtable on which his hand had fallen with the sound of a sharp blow
what i want to know is what put it out of your head till now  put it out of my head repeated the chief inspector very slowly
yes
till you were called into this roomyou know  the chief inspector felt as if the air between his clothing and his skin had become unpleasantly hot
it was the sensation of an unprecedented and incredible experience
of course he said exaggerating the deliberation of his utterance to the utmost limits of possibility if there is a reason of which i know nothing for not interfering with the convict michaelis perhaps its just as well i didnt start the county police after him  this took such a long time to say that the unflagging attention of the assistant commissioner seemed a wonderful feat of endurance
his retort came without delay
no reason whatever that i know of
come chief inspector this finessing with me is highly improper on your parthighly improper
and its also unfair you know
you shouldnt leave me to puzzle things out for myself like this
really i am surprised  he paused then added smoothly i need scarcely tell you that this conversation is altogether unofficial  these words were far from pacifying the chief inspector
the indignation of a betrayed tightrope performer was strong within him
in his pride of a trusted servant he was affected by the assurance that the rope was not shaken for the purpose of breaking his neck as by an exhibition of impudence
as if anybody were afraid
assistant commissioners come and go but a valuable chief inspector is not an ephemeral office phenomenon
he was not afraid of getting a broken neck
to have his performance spoiled was more than enough to account for the glow of honest indignation
and as thought is no respecter of persons the thought of chief inspector heat took a threatening and prophetic shape
you my boy he said to himself keeping his round and habitually roving eyes fastened upon the assistant commissioners faceyou my boy you dont know your place and your place wont know you very long either i bet  as if in provoking answer to that thought something like the ghost of an amiable smile passed on the lips of the assistant commissioner
his manner was easy and businesslike while he persisted in administering another shake to the tight rope
let us come now to what you have discovered on the spot chief inspector he said
a fool and his job are soon parted went on the train of prophetic thought in chief inspector heats head
but it was immediately followed by the reflection that a higher official even when fired out this was the precise image has still the time as he flies through the door to launch a nasty kick at the shinbones of a subordinate
without softening very much the basilisk nature of his stare he said impassively  we are coming to that part of my investigation sir  thats right
well what have you brought away from it  the chief inspector who had made up his mind to jump off the rope came to the ground with gloomy frankness
ive brought away an address he said pulling out of his pocket without haste a singed rag of dark blue cloth
this belongs to the overcoat the fellow who got himself blown to pieces was wearing
of course the overcoat may not have been his and may even have been stolen
but thats not at all probable if you look at this  the chief inspector stepping up to the table smoothed out carefully the rag of blue cloth
he had picked it up from the repulsive heap in the mortuary because a tailors name is found sometimes under the collar
it is not often of much use but stillhe only half expected to find anything useful but certainly he did not expect to findnot under the collar at all but stitched carefully on the under side of the lapela square piece of calico with an address written on it in marking ink
the chief inspector removed his smoothing hand
i carried it off with me without anybody taking notice he said
i thought it best
it can always be produced if required  the assistant commissioner rising a little in his chair pulled the cloth over to his side of the table
he sat looking at it in silence
only the number  and the name of brett street were written in marking ink on a piece of calico slightly larger than an ordinary cigarette paper
he was genuinely surprised
cant understand why he should have gone about labelled like this he said looking up at chief inspector heat
its a most extraordinary thing  i met once in the smokingroom of a hotel an old gentleman who went about with his name and address sewn on in all his coats in case of an accident or sudden illness said the chief inspector
he professed to be eightyfour years old but he didnt look his age
he told me he was also afraid of losing his memory suddenly like those people he has been reading of in the papers  a question from the assistant commissioner who wanted to know what was no
 brett street interrupted that reminiscence abruptly
the chief inspector driven down to the ground by unfair artifices had elected to walk the path of unreserved openness
if he believed firmly that to know too much was not good for the department the judicious holding back of knowledge was as far as his loyalty dared to go for the good of the service
if the assistant commissioner wanted to mismanage this affair nothing of course could prevent him
but on his own part he now saw no reason for a display of alacrity
so he answered concisely  its a shop sir  the assistant commissioner with his eyes lowered on the rag of blue cloth waited for more information
as that did not come he proceeded to obtain it by a series of questions propounded with gentle patience
thus he acquired an idea of the nature of mr verlocs commerce of his personal appearance and heard at last his name
in a pause the assistant commissioner raised his eyes and discovered some animation on the chief inspectors face
they looked at each other in silence
of course said the latter the department has no record of that man  did any of my predecessors have any knowledge of what you have told me now asked the assistant commissioner putting his elbows on the table and raising his joined hands before his face as if about to offer prayer only that his eyes had not a pious expression
no sir certainly not
what would have been the object
that sort of man could never be produced publicly to any good purpose
it was sufficient for me to know who he was and to make use of him in a way that could be used publicly  and do you think that sort of private knowledge consistent with the official position you occupy  perfectly sir
i think its quite proper
i will take the liberty to tell you sir that it makes me what i amand i am looked upon as a man who knows his work
its a private affair of my own
a personal friend of mine in the french police gave me the hint that the fellow was an embassy spy
private friendship private information private use of itthats how i look upon it  the assistant commissioner after remarking to himself that the mental state of the renowned chief inspector seemed to affect the outline of his lower jaw as if the lively sense of his high professional distinction had been located in that part of his anatomy dismissed the point for the moment with a calm i see  then leaning his cheek on his joined hands  well thenspeaking privately if you likehow long have you been in private touch with this embassy spy  to this inquiry the private answer of the chief inspector so private that it was never shaped into audible words was  long before you were even thought of for your place here  the sotospeak public utterance was much more precise
i saw him for the first time in my life a little more than seven years ago when two imperial highnesses and the imperial chancellor were on a visit here
i was put in charge of all the arrangements for looking after them
baron stottwartenheim was ambassador then
he was a very nervous old gentleman
one evening three days before the guildhall banquet he sent word that he wanted to see me for a moment
i was downstairs and the carriages were at the door to take the imperial highnesses and the chancellor to the opera
i went up at once
i found the baron walking up and down his bedroom in a pitiable state of distress squeezing his hands together
he assured me he had the fullest confidence in our police and in my abilities but he had there a man just come over from paris whose information could be trusted implicity
he wanted me to hear what that man had to say
he took me at once into a dressingroom next door where i saw a big fellow in a heavy overcoat sitting all alone on a chair and holding his hat and stick in one hand
the baron said to him in french speak my friend  the light in that room was not very good
i talked with him for some five minutes perhaps
he certainly gave me a piece of very startling news
then the baron took me aside nervously to praise him up to me and when i turned round again i discovered that the fellow had vanished like a ghost
got up and sneaked out down some back stairs i suppose
there was no time to run after him as i had to hurry off after the ambassador down the great staircase and see the party started safe for the opera
however i acted upon the information that very night
whether it was perfectly correct or not it did look serious enough
very likely it saved us from an ugly trouble on the day of the imperial visit to the city
some time later a month or so after my promotion to chief inspector my attention was attracted to a big burly man i thought i had seen somewhere before coming out in a hurry from a jewellers shop in the strand
i went after him as it was on my way towards charing cross and there seeing one of our detectives across the road i beckoned him over and pointed out the fellow to him with instructions to watch his movements for a couple of days and then report to me
no later than next afternoon my man turned up to tell me that the fellow had married his landladys daughter at a registrars office that very day at  am and had gone off with her to margate for a week
our man had seen the luggage being put on the cab
there were some old paris labels on one of the bags
somehow i couldnt get the fellow out of my head and the very next time i had to go to paris on service i spoke about him to that friend of mine in the paris police
my friend said from what you tell me i think you must mean a rather wellknown hangeron and emissary of the revolutionary red committee
he says he is an englishman by birth
we have an idea that he has been for a good few years now a secret agent of one of the foreign embassies in london  this woke up my memory completely
he was the vanishing fellow i saw sitting on a chair in baron stottwartenheims bathroom
i told my friend that he was quite right
the fellow was a secret agent to my certain knowledge
afterwards my friend took the trouble to ferret out the complete record of that man for me
i thought i had better know all there was to know but i dont suppose you want to hear his history now sir  the assistant commissioner shook his supported head
the history of your relations with that useful personage is the only thing that matters just now he said closing slowly his weary deepset eyes and then opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance
theres nothing official about them said the chief inspector bitterly
i went into his shop one evening told him who i was and reminded him of our first meeting
he didnt as much as twitch an eyebrow
he said that he was married and settled now and that all he wanted was not to be interfered in his little business
i took it upon myself to promise him that as long as he didnt go in for anything obviously outrageous he would be left alone by the police
that was worth something to him because a word from us to the customhouse people would have been enough to get some of these packages he gets from paris and brussels opened in dover with confiscation to follow for certain and perhaps a prosecution as well at the end of it  thats a very precarious trade murmured the assistant commissioner
why did he go in for that  the chief inspector raised scornful eyebrows dispassionately
most likely got a connectionfriends on the continentamongst people who deal in such wares
they would be just the sort he would consort with
hes a lazy dog toolike the rest of them  what do you get from him in exchange for your protection  the chief inspector was not inclined to enlarge on the value of mr verlocs services
he would not be much good to anybody but myself
one has got to know a good deal beforehand to make use of a man like that
i can understand the sort of hint he can give
and when i want a hint he can generally furnish it to me  the chief inspector lost himself suddenly in a discreet reflective mood and the assistant commissioner repressed a smile at the fleeting thought that the reputation of chief inspector heat might possibly have been made in a great part by the secret agent verloc
in a more general way of being of use all our men of the special crimes section on duty at charing cross and victoria have orders to take careful notice of anybody they may see with him
he meets the new arrivals frequently and afterwards keeps track of them
he seems to have been told off for that sort of duty
when i want an address in a hurry i can always get it from him
of course i know how to manage our relations
i havent seen him to speak to three times in the last two years
i drop him a line unsigned and he answers me in the same way at my private address  from time to time the assistant commissioner gave an almost imperceptible nod
the chief inspector added that he did not suppose mr verloc to be deep in the confidence of the prominent members of the revolutionary international council but that he was generally trusted of that there could be no doubt
whenever ive had reason to think there was something in the wind he concluded ive always found he could tell me something worth knowing  the assistant commissioner made a significant remark
he failed you this time  neither had i wind of anything in any other way retorted chief inspector heat
i asked him nothing so he could tell me nothing
he isnt one of our men
it isnt as if he were in our pay  no muttered the assistant commissioner
hes a spy in the pay of a foreign government
we could never confess to him  i must do my work in my own way declared the chief inspector
when it comes to that i would deal with the devil himself and take the consequences
there are things not fit for everybody to know  your idea of secrecy seems to consist in keeping the chief of your department in the dark
thats stretching it perhaps a little too far isnt it
he lives over his shop  whoverloc
oh yes
he lives over his shop
the wifes mother i fancy lives with them  is the house watched  oh dear no
it wouldnt do
certain people who come there are watched
my opinion is that he knows nothing of this affair  how do you account for this  the assistant commissioner nodded at the cloth rag lying before him on the table
i dont account for it at all sir
its simply unaccountable
it cant be explained by what i know  the chief inspector made those admissions with the frankness of a man whose reputation is established as if on a rock
at any rate not at this present moment
i think that the man who had most to do with it will turn out to be michaelis  you do  yes sir because i can answer for all the others  what about that other man supposed to have escaped from the park  i should think hes far away by this time opined the chief inspector
the assistant commissioner looked hard at him and rose suddenly as though having made up his mind to some course of action
as a matter of fact he had that very moment succumbed to a fascinating temptation
the chief inspector heard himself dismissed with instructions to meet his superior early next morning for further consultation upon the case
he listened with an impenetrable face and walked out of the room with measured steps
whatever might have been the plans of the assistant commissioner they had nothing to do with that desk work which was the bane of his existence because of its confined nature and apparent lack of reality
it could not have had or else the general air of alacrity that came upon the assistant commissioner would have been inexplicable
as soon as he was left alone he looked for his hat impulsively and put it on his head
having done that he sat down again to reconsider the whole matter
but as his mind was already made up this did not take long
and before chief inspector heat had gone very far on the way home he also left the building
chapter vii   the assistant commissioner walked along a short and narrow street like a wet muddy trench then crossing a very broad thoroughfare entered a public edifice and sought speech with a young private secretary unpaid of a great personage
this fair smoothfaced young man whose symmetrically arranged hair gave him the air of a large and neat schoolboy met the assistant commissioners request with a doubtful look and spoke with bated breath
would he see you
i dont know about that
he has walked over from the house an hour ago to talk with the permanent undersecretary and now hes ready to walk back again
he might have sent for him but he does it for the sake of a little exercise i suppose
its all the exercise he can find time for while this session lasts
i dont complain i rather enjoy these little strolls
he leans on my arm and doesnt open his lips
but i say hes very tired andwellnot in the sweetest of tempers just now  its in connection with that greenwich affair  oh
i say
hes very bitter against you people
but i will go and see if you insist  do
thats a good fellow said the assistant commissioner
the unpaid secretary admired this pluck
composing for himself an innocent face he opened a door and went in with the assurance of a nice and privileged child
and presently he reappeared with a nod to the assistant commissioner who passing through the same door left open for him found himself with the great personage in a large room
vast in bulk and stature with a long white face which broadened at the base by a big double chin appeared eggshaped in the fringe of thin greyish whisker the great personage seemed an expanding man
unfortunate from a tailoring point of view the crossfolds in the middle of a buttoned black coat added to the impression as if the fastenings of the garment were tried to the utmost
from the head set upward on a thick neck the eyes with puffy lower lids stared with a haughty droop on each side of a hooked aggressive nose nobly salient in the vast pale circumference of the face
a shiny silk hat and a pair of worn gloves lying ready on the end of a long table looked expanded too enormous
he stood on the hearthrug in big roomy boots and uttered no word of greeting
i would like to know if this is the beginning of another dynamite campaign he asked at once in a deep very smooth voice
dont go into details
i have no time for that  the assistant commissioners figure before this big and rustic presence had the frail slenderness of a reed addressing an oak
and indeed the unbroken record of that mans descent surpassed in the number of centuries the age of the oldest oak in the country
no
as far as one can be positive about anything i can assure you that it is not  yes
but your idea of assurances over there said the great man with a contemptuous wave of his hand towards a window giving on the broad thoroughfare seems to consist mainly in making the secretary of state look a fool
i have been told positively in this very room less than a month ago that nothing of the sort was even possible  the assistant commissioner glanced in the direction of the window calmly
you will allow me to remark sir ethelred that so far i have had no opportunity to give you assurances of any kind  the haughty droop of the eyes was focussed now upon the assistant commissioner
true confessed the deep smooth voice
i sent for heat
you are still rather a novice in your new berth
and how are you getting on over there  i believe i am learning something every day  of course of course
i hope you will get on  thank you sir ethelred
ive learned something today and even within the last hour or so
there is much in this affair of a kind that does not meet the eye in a usual anarchist outrage even if one looked into it as deep as can be
thats why i am here  the great man put his arms akimbo the backs of his big hands resting on his hips
very well
go on
only no details pray
spare me the details  you shall not be troubled with them sir ethelred the assistant commissioner began with a calm and untroubled assurance
while he was speaking the hands on the face of the clock behind the great mans backa heavy glistening affair of massive scrolls in the same dark marble as the mantelpiece and with a ghostly evanescent tickhad moved through the space of seven minutes
he spoke with a studious fidelity to a parenthetical manner into which every little factthat is every detailfitted with delightful ease
not a murmur nor even a movement hinted at interruption
the great personage might have been the statue of one of his own princely ancestors stripped of a crusaders war harness and put into an illfitting frock coat
the assistant commissioner felt as though he were at liberty to talk for an hour
but he kept his head and at the end of the time mentioned above he broke off with a sudden conclusion which reproducing the opening statement pleasantly surprised sir ethelred by its apparent swiftness and force
the kind of thing which meets us under the surface of this affair otherwise without gravity is unusualin this precise form at leastand requires special treatment  the tone of sir ethelred was deepened full of conviction
i should think soinvolving the ambassador of a foreign power  oh
the ambassador protested the other erect and slender allowing himself a mere half smile
it would be stupid of me to advance anything of the kind
and it is absolutely unnecessary because if i am right in my surmises whether ambassador or hall porter its a mere detail  sir ethelred opened a wide mouth like a cavern into which the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer there came from it a subdued rolling sound as from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop
no
these people are too impossible
what do they mean by importing their methods of crimtartary here
a turk would have more decency  you forget sir ethelred that strictly speaking we know nothing positivelyas yet  no
but how would you define it
shortly  barefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a peculiar sort  we cant put up with the innocence of nasty little children said the great and expanded personage expanding a little more as it were
the haughty drooping glance struck crushingly the carpet at the assistant commissioners feet
theyll have to get a hard rap on the knuckles over this affair
we must be in a position towhat is your general idea stated shortly
no need to go into details  no sir ethelred
in principle i should lay it down that the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated as tending to augment the positive dangers of the evil against which they are used
that the spy will fabricate his information is a mere commonplace
but in the sphere of political and revolutionary action relying partly on violence the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts themselves and will spread the double evil of emulation in one direction and of panic hasty legislation unreflecting hate on the other
however this is an imperfect world  the deepvoiced presence on the hearthrug motionless with big elbows stuck out said hastily  be lucid please  yes sir ethelredan imperfect world
therefore directly the character of this affair suggested itself to me i thought it should be dealt with with special secrecy and ventured to come over here  thats right approved the great personage glancing down complacently over his double chin
i am glad theres somebody over at your shop who thinks that the secretary of state may be trusted now and then  the assistant commissioner had an amused smile
i was really thinking that it might be better at this stage for heat to be replaced by  what
heat
an asseh exclaimed the great man with distinct animosity
not at all
pray sir ethelred dont put that unjust interpretation on my remarks  then what
too clever by half  neitherat least not as a rule
all the grounds of my surmises i have from him
the only thing ive discovered by myself is that he has been making use of that man privately
who could blame him
hes an old police hand
he told me virtually that he must have tools to work with
it occurred to me that this tool should be surrendered to the special crimes division as a whole instead of remaining the private property of chief inspector heat
i extend my conception of our departmental duties to the suppression of the secret agent
but chief inspector heat is an old departmental hand
he would accuse me of perverting its morality and attacking its efficiency
he would define it bitterly as protection extended to the criminal class of revolutionists
it would mean just that to him  yes
but what do you mean  i mean to say first that theres but poor comfort in being able to declare that any given act of violencedamaging property or destroying lifeis not the work of anarchism at all but of something else altogethersome species of authorised scoundrelism
this i fancy is much more frequent than we suppose
next its obvious that the existence of these people in the pay of foreign governments destroys in a measure the efficiency of our supervision
a spy of that sort can afford to be more reckless than the most reckless of conspirators
his occupation is free from all restraint
hes without as much faith as is necessary for complete negation and without that much law as is implied in lawlessness
thirdly the existence of these spies amongst the revolutionary groups which we are reproached for harbouring here does away with all certitude
you have received a reassuring statement from chief inspector heat some time ago
it was by no means groundlessand yet this episode happens
i call it an episode because this affair i make bold to say is episodic it is no part of any general scheme however wild
the very peculiarities which surprise and perplex chief inspector heat establish its character in my eyes
i am keeping clear of details sir ethelred  the personage on the hearthrug had been listening with profound attention
just so
be as concise as you can  the assistant commissioner intimated by an earnest deferential gesture that he was anxious to be concise
there is a peculiar stupidity and feebleness in the conduct of this affair which gives me excellent hopes of getting behind it and finding there something else than an individual freak of fanaticism
for it is a planned thing undoubtedly
the actual perpetrator seems to have been led by the hand to the spot and then abandoned hurriedly to his own devices
the inference is that he was imported from abroad for the purpose of committing this outrage
at the same time one is forced to the conclusion that he did not know enough english to ask his way unless one were to accept the fantastic theory that he was a deaf mute
i wonder nowbut this is idle
he has destroyed himself by an accident obviously
not an extraordinary accident
but an extraordinary little fact remains the address on his clothing discovered by the merest accident too
it is an incredible little fact so incredible that the explanation which will account for it is bound to touch the bottom of this affair
instead of instructing heat to go on with this case my intention is to seek this explanation personallyby myself i meanwhere it may be picked up
that is in a certain shop in brett street and on the lips of a certain secret agent once upon a time the confidential and trusted spy of the late baron stottwartenheim ambassador of a great power to the court of st james  the assistant commissioner paused then added those fellows are a perfect pest  in order to raise his drooping glance to the speakers face the personage on the hearthrug had gradually tilted his head farther back which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness
why not leave it to heat  because he is an old departmental hand
they have their own morality
my line of inquiry would appear to him an awful perversion of duty
for him the plain duty is to fasten the guilt upon as many prominent anarchists as he can on some slight indications he had picked up in the course of his investigation on the spot whereas i he would say am bent upon vindicating their innocence
i am trying to be as lucid as i can in presenting this obscure matter to you without details  he would would he muttered the proud head of sir ethelred from its lofty elevation
i am afraid sowith an indignation and disgust of which you or i can have no idea
hes an excellent servant
we must not put an undue strain on his loyalty
thats always a mistake
besides i want a free handa freer hand than it would be perhaps advisable to give chief inspector heat
i havent the slightest wish to spare this man verloc
he will i imagine be extremely startled to find his connection with this affair whatever it may be brought home to him so quickly
frightening him will not be very difficult
but our true objective lies behind him somewhere
i want your authority to give him such assurances of personal safety as i may think proper  certainly said the personage on the hearthrug
find out as much as you can find it out in your own way  i must set about it without loss of time this very evening said the assistant commissioner
sir ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails and tilting back his head looked at him steadily
well have a late sitting tonight he said
come to the house with your discoveries if we are not gone home
ill warn toodles to look out for you
hell take you into my room  the numerous family and the wide connections of the youthfullooking private secretary cherished for him the hope of an austere and exalted destiny
meantime the social sphere he adorned in his hours of idleness chose to pet him under the above nickname
and sir ethelred hearing it on the lips of his wife and girls every day mostly at breakfasttime had conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption
the assistant commissioner was surprised and gratified extremely
i shall certainly bring my discoveries to the house on the chance of you having the time to  i wont have the time interrupted the great personage
but i will see you
i havent the time nowand you are going yourself  yes sir ethelred
i think it the best way  the personage had tilted his head so far back that in order to keep the assistant commissioner under his observation he had to nearly close his eyes
hm
ha
and how do you proposewill you assume a disguise  hardly a disguise
ill change my clothes of course  of course repeated the great man with a sort of absentminded loftiness
he turned his big head slowly and over his shoulder gave a haughty oblique stare to the ponderous marble timepiece with the sly feeble tick
the gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through no less than five and twenty minutes behind his back
the assistant commissioner who could not see them grew a little nervous in the interval
but the great man presented to him a calm and undismayed face
very well he said and paused as if in deliberate contempt of the official clock
but what first put you in motion in this direction  i have been always of opinion began the assistant commissioner
ah
yes
opinion
thats of course
but the immediate motive  what shall i say sir ethelred
a new mans antagonism to old methods
a desire to know something at first hand
some impatience
its my old work but the harness is different
it has been chafing me a little in one or two tender places  i hope youll get on over there said the great man kindly extending his hand soft to the touch but broad and powerful like the hand of a glorified farmer
the assistant commissioner shook it and withdrew
in the outer room toodles who had been waiting perched on the edge of a table advanced to meet him subduing his natural buoyancy
well
satisfactory he asked with airy importance
perfectly
youve earned my undying gratitude answered the assistant commissioner whose long face looked wooden in contrast with the peculiar character of the others gravity which seemed perpetually ready to break into ripples and chuckles
thats all right
but seriously you cant imagine how irritated he is by the attacks on his bill for the nationalisation of fisheries
they call it the beginning of social revolution
of course it is a revolutionary measure
but these fellows have no decency
the personal attacks  i read the papers remarked the assistant commissioner
odious
eh
and you have no notion what a mass of work he has got to get through every day
he does it all himself
seems unable to trust anyone with these fisheries  and yet hes given a whole half hour to the consideration of my very small sprat interjected the assistant commissioner
small
is it
im glad to hear that
but its a pity you didnt keep away then
this fight takes it out of him frightfully
the mans getting exhausted
i feel it by the way he leans on my arm as we walk over
and i say is he safe in the streets
mullins has been marching his men up here this afternoon
theres a constable stuck by every lamppost and every second person we meet between this and palace yard is an obvious tec  it will get on his nerves presently
i say these foreign scoundrels arent likely to throw something at himare they
it would be a national calamity
the country cant spare him  not to mention yourself
he leans on your arm suggested the assistant commissioner soberly
you would both go  it would be an easy way for a young man to go down into history
not so many british ministers have been assassinated as to make it a minor incident
but seriously now  i am afraid that if you want to go down into history youll have to do something for it
seriously theres no danger whatever for both of you but from overwork  the sympathetic toodles welcomed this opening for a chuckle
the fisheries wont kill me
i am used to late hours he declared with ingenuous levity
but feeling an instant compunction he began to assume an air of statesmanlike moodiness as one draws on a glove
his massive intellect will stand any amount of work
its his nerves that i am afraid of
the reactionary gang with that abusive brute cheeseman at their head insult him every night  if he will insist on beginning a revolution murmured the assistant commissioner
the time has come and he is the only man great enough for the work protested the revolutionary toodles flaring up under the calm speculative gaze of the assistant commissioner
somewhere in a corridor a distant bell tinkled urgently and with devoted vigilance the young man pricked up his ears at the sound
hes ready to go now he exclaimed in a whisper snatched up his hat and vanished from the room
the assistant commissioner went out by another door in a less elastic manner
again he crossed the wide thoroughfare walked along a narrow street and reentered hastily his own departmental buildings
he kept up this accelerated pace to the door of his private room
before he had closed it fairly his eyes sought his desk
he stood still for a moment then walked up looked all round on the floor sat down in his chair rang a bell and waited
chief inspector heat gone yet  yes sir
went away halfanhour ago  he nodded
that will do  and sitting still with his hat pushed off his forehead he thought that it was just like heats confounded cheek to carry off quietly the only piece of material evidence
but he thought this without animosity
old and valued servants will take liberties
the piece of overcoat with the address sewn on was certainly not a thing to leave about
dismissing from his mind this manifestation of chief inspector heats mistrust he wrote and despatched a note to his wife charging her to make his apologies to michaelis great lady with whom they were engaged to dine that evening
the short jacket and the low round hat he assumed in a sort of curtained alcove containing a washstand a row of wooden pegs and a shelf brought out wonderfully the length of his grave brown face
he stepped back into the full light of the room looking like the vision of a cool reflective don quixote with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a very deliberate manner
he left the scene of his daily labours quickly like an unobtrusive shadow
his descent into the street was like the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off
a murky gloomy dampness enveloped him
the walls of the houses were wet the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence and when he emerged into the strand out of a narrow street by the side of charing cross station the genius of the locality assimilated him
he might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners
he came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement and waited
his exercised eyes had made out in the confused movements of lights and shadows thronging the roadway the crawling approach of a hansom
he gave no sign but when the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his feet he dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel and spoke up through the little trap door almost before the man gazing supinely ahead from his perch was aware of having been boarded by a fare
it was not a long drive
it ended by signal abruptly nowhere in particular between two lampposts before a large drapery establishmenta long range of shops already lapped up in sheets of corrugated iron for the night
tendering a coin through the trap door the fare slipped out and away leaving an effect of uncanny eccentric ghastliness upon the drivers mind
but the size of the coin was satisfactory to his touch and his education not being literary he remained untroubled by the fear of finding it presently turned to a dead leaf in his pocket
raised above the world of fares by the nature of his calling he contemplated their actions with a limited interest
the sharp pulling of his horse right round expressed his philosophy
meantime the assistant commissioner was already giving his order to a waiter in a little italian restaurant round the cornerone of those traps for the hungry long and narrow baited with a perspective of mirrors and white napery without air but with an atmosphere of their ownan atmosphere of fraudulent cookery mocking an abject mankind in the most pressing of its miserable necessities
in this immoral atmosphere the assistant commissioner reflecting upon his enterprise seemed to lose some more of his identity
he had a sense of loneliness of evil freedom
it was rather pleasant
when after paying for his short meal he stood up and waited for his change he saw himself in the sheet of glass and was struck by his foreign appearance
he contemplated his own image with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze then by sudden inspiration raised the collar of his jacket
this arrangement appeared to him commendable and he completed it by giving an upward twist to the ends of his black moustache
he was satisfied by the subtle modification of his personal aspect caused by these small changes
thatll do very well he thought
ill get a little wet a little splashed  he became aware of the waiter at his elbow and of a small pile of silver coins on the edge of the table before him
the waiter kept one eye on it while his other eye followed the long back of a tall not very young girl who passed up to a distant table looking perfectly sightless and altogether unapproachable
she seemed to be a habitual customer
on going out the assistant commissioner made to himself the observation that the patrons of the place had lost in the frequentation of fraudulent cookery all their national and private characteristics
and this was strange since the italian restaurant is such a peculiarly british institution
but these people were as denationalised as the dishes set before them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability
neither was their personality stamped in any way professionally socially or racially
they seemed created for the italian restaurant unless the italian restaurant had been perchance created for them
but that last hypothesis was unthinkable since one could not place them anywhere outside those special establishments
one never met these enigmatical persons elsewhere
it was impossible to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night
and he himself had become unplaced
it would have been impossible for anybody to guess his occupation
as to going to bed there was a doubt even in his own mind
not indeed in regard to his domicile itself but very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return there
a pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard the glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled thud
he advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster interspersed with lamps and enveloped oppressed penetrated choked and suffocated by the blackness of a wet london night which is composed of soot and drops of water
brett street was not very far away
it branched off narrow from the side of an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious houses temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night
only a fruiterers stall at the corner made a violent blaze of light and colour
beyond all was black and the few people passing in that direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and lemons
no footsteps echoed
they would never be heard of again
the adventurous head of the special crimes department watched these disappearances from a distance with an interested eye
he felt lighthearted as though he had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands
this joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very serious affair after all
for the assistant commissioner was not constitutionally inclined to levity
the policeman on the beat projected his sombre and moving form against the luminous glory of oranges and lemons and entered brett street without haste
the assistant commissioner as though he were a member of the criminal classes lingered out of sight awaiting his return
but this constable seemed to be lost for ever to the force
he never returned must have gone out at the other end of brett street
the assistant commissioner reaching this conclusion entered the street in his turn and came upon a large van arrested in front of the dimly lit windowpanes of a carters eatinghouse
the man was refreshing himself inside and the horses their big heads lowered to the ground fed out of nosebags steadily
farther on on the opposite side of the street another suspect patch of dim light issued from mr verlocs shop front hung with papers heaving with vague piles of cardboard boxes and the shapes of books
the assistant commissioner stood observing it across the roadway
there could be no mistake
by the side of the front window encumbered by the shadows of nondescript things the door standing ajar let escape on the pavement a narrow clear streak of gaslight within
behind the assistant commissioner the van and horses merged into one mass seemed something alivea squarebacked black monster blocking half the street with sudden ironshod stampings fierce jingles and heavy blowing sighs
the harshly festive illomened glare of a large and prosperous publichouse faced the other end of brett street across a wide road
this barrier of blazing lights opposing the shadows gathered about the humble abode of mr verlocs domestic happiness seemed to drive the obscurity of the street back upon itself make it more sullen brooding and sinister
chapter viii   having infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat into the chilly interest of several licensed victuallers the acquaintances once upon a time of her late unlucky husband mrs verlocs mother had at last secured her admission to certain almshouses founded by a wealthy innkeeper for the destitute widows of the trade
this end conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart the old woman had pursued with secrecy and determination
that was the time when her daughter winnie could not help passing a remark to mr verloc that mother has been spending halfcrowns and five shillings almost every day this last week in cab fares  but the remark was not made grudgingly
winnie respected her mothers infirmities
she was only a little surprised at this sudden mania for locomotion
mr verloc who was sufficiently magnificent in his way had grunted the remark impatiently aside as interfering with his meditations
these were frequent deep and prolonged they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings
distinctly more important and beyond all comparison more difficult to consider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity
her object attained in astute secrecy the heroic old woman had made a clean breast of it to mrs verloc
her soul was triumphant and her heart tremulous
inwardly she quaked because she dreaded and admired the calm selfcontained character of her daughter winnie whose displeasure was made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences
but she did not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of venerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin the floating ampleness of her ancient form and the impotent condition of her legs
the shock of the information was so unexpected that mrs verloc against her usual practice when addressed interrupted the domestic occupation she was engaged upon
it was the dusting of the furniture in the parlour behind the shop
she turned her head towards her mother
whatever did you want to do that for she exclaimed in scandalised astonishment
the shock must have been severe to make her depart from that distant and uninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force and her safeguard in life
werent you made comfortable enough here  she had lapsed into these inquiries but next moment she saved the consistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting while the old woman sat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and lustreless dark wig
winnie finished the chair and ran the duster along the mahogany at the back of the horsehair sofa on which mr verloc loved to take his ease in hat and overcoat
she was intent on her work but presently she permitted herself another question
how in the world did you manage it mother  as not affecting the inwardness of things which it was mrs verlocs principle to ignore this curiosity was excusable
it bore merely on the methods
the old woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something that could be talked about with much sincerity
she favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer full of names and enriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as observed in the alteration of human countenances
the names were principally the names of licensed victuallerspoor daddys friends my dear  she enlarged with special appreciation on the kindness and condescension of a large brewer a baronet and an m p the chairman of the governors of the charity
she expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed to interview by appointment his private secretarya very polite gentleman all in black with a gentle sad voice but so very very thin and quiet
he was like a shadow my dear  winnie prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was told to the end walked out of the parlour into the kitchen down two steps in her usual manner without the slightest comment
shedding a few tears in sign of rejoicing at her daughters mansuetude in this terrible affair mrs verlocs mother gave play to her astuteness in the direction of her furniture because it was her own and sometimes she wished it hadnt been
heroism is all very well but there are circumstances when the disposal of a few tables and chairs brass bedsteads and so on may be big with remote and disastrous consequences
she required a few pieces herself the foundation which after many importunities had gathered her to its charitable breast giving nothing but bare planks and cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its solicitude
the delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged because winnies philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts she assumed that mother took what suited her best
as to mr verloc his intense meditation like a sort of chinese wall isolated him completely from the phenomena of this world of vain effort and illusory appearances
her selection made the disposal of the rest became a perplexing question in a particular way
she was leaving it in brett street of course
but she had two children
winnie was provided for by her sensible union with that excellent husband mr verloc
stevie was destituteand a little peculiar
his position had to be considered before the claims of legal justice and even the promptings of partiality
the possession of the furniture would not be in any sense a provision
he ought to have itthe poor boy
but to give it to him would be like tampering with his position of complete dependence
it was a sort of claim which she feared to weaken
moreover the susceptibilities of mr verloc would perhaps not brook being beholden to his brotherinlaw for the chairs he sat on
in a long experience of gentlemen lodgers mrs verlocs mother had acquired a dismal but resigned notion of the fantastic side of human nature
what if mr verloc suddenly took it into his head to tell stevie to take his blessed sticks somewhere out of that
a division on the other hand however carefully made might give some cause of offence to winnie
no stevie must remain destitute and dependent
and at the moment of leaving brett street she had said to her daughter no use waiting till i am dead is there
everything i leave here is altogether your own now my dear  winnie with her hat on silent behind her mothers back went on arranging the collar of the old womans cloak
she got her handbag an umbrella with an impassive face
the time had come for the expenditure of the sum of threeandsixpence on what might well be supposed the last cab drive of mrs verlocs mothers life
they went out at the shop door
the conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the proverb that truth can be more cruel than caricature if such a proverb existed
crawling behind an infirm horse a metropolitan hackney carriage drew up on wobbly wheels and with a maimed driver on the box
this last peculiarity caused some embarrassment
catching sight of a hooked iron contrivance protruding from the left sleeve of the mans coat mrs verlocs mother lost suddenly the heroic courage of these days
she really couldnt trust herself
what do you think winnie  she hung back
the passionate expostulations of the bigfaced cabman seemed to be squeezed out of a blocked throat
leaning over from his box he whispered with mysterious indignation
what was the matter now
was it possible to treat a man so
his enormous and unwashed countenance flamed red in the muddy stretch of the street
was it likely they would have given him a licence he inquired desperately if  the police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly glance then addressing himself to the two women without marked consideration said  hes been driving a cab for twenty years
i never knew him to have an accident  accident shouted the driver in a scornful whisper
the policemans testimony settled it
the modest assemblage of seven people mostly under age dispersed
winnie followed her mother into the cab
stevie climbed on the box
his vacant mouth and distressed eyes depicted the state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were taking place
in the narrow streets the progress of the journey was made sensible to those within by the near fronts of the houses gliding past slowly and shakily with a great rattle and jingling of glass as if about to collapse behind the cab and the infirm horse with the harness hung over his sharp backbone flapping very loose about his thighs appeared to be dancing mincingly on his toes with infinite patience
later on in the wider space of whitehall all visual evidences of motion became imperceptible
the rattle and jingle of glass went on indefinitely in front of the long treasury buildingand time itself seemed to stand still
at last winnie observed this isnt a very good horse  her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead immovable
on the box stevie shut his vacant mouth first in order to ejaculate earnestly dont  the driver holding high the reins twisted around the hook took no notice
perhaps he had not heard
stevies breast heaved
dont whip  the man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs
his little red eyes glistened with moisture
his big lips had a violet tint
they remained closed
with the dirty back of his whiphand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin
you mustnt stammered out stevie violently
it hurts  mustnt whip queried the other in a thoughtful whisper and immediately whipped
he did this not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil but because he had to earn his fare
and for a time the walls of st stephens with its towers and pinnacles contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled
it rolled too however
but on the bridge there was a commotion
stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box
there were shouts on the pavement people ran forward the driver pulled up whispering curses of indignation and astonishment
winnie lowered the window and put her head out white as a ghost
in the depths of the cab her mother was exclaiming in tones of anguish is that boy hurt
is that boy hurt  stevie was not hurt he had not even fallen but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech
he could do no more than stammer at the window
too heavy
too heavy  winnie put out her hand on to his shoulder
stevie
get up on the box directly and dont try to get down again  no
no
walk
must walk  in trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence
no physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim
stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm dancing horse without getting out of breath
but his sister withheld her consent decisively
the idea
whoever heard of such a thing
run after a cab  her mother frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance entreated oh dont let him winnie
hell get lost
dont let him  certainly not
what next
mr verloc will be sorry to hear of this nonsense steviei can tell you
he wont be happy at all  the idea of mr verlocs grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully upon stevies fundamentally docile disposition he abandoned all resistance and climbed up again on the box with a face of despair
the cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance truculently
dont you go for trying this silly game again young fellow  after delivering himself thus in a stern whisper strained almost to extinction he drove on ruminating solemnly
to his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure
but his intellect though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather lacked not independence or sanity
gravely he dismissed the hypothesis of stevie being a drunken young nipper
inside the cab the spell of silence in which the two women had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting rattling and jingling of the journey had been broken by stevies outbreak
winnie raised her voice
youve done what you wanted mother
youll have only yourself to thank for it if you arent happy afterwards
and i dont think youll be
that i dont
werent you comfortable enough in the house
whatever peoplell think of usyou throwing yourself like this on a charity  my dear screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise youve been the best of daughters to me
as to mr verlocthere  words failing her on the subject of mr verlocs excellence she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab
then she averted her head on the pretence of looking out of the window as if to judge of their progress
it was insignificant and went on close to the curbstone
night the early dirty night the sinister noisy hopeless and rowdy night of south london had overtaken her on her last cab drive
in the gaslight of the lowfronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange hue under a black and mauve bonnet
mrs verlocs mothers complexion had become yellow by the effect of age and from a natural predisposition to biliousness favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence first as wife then as widow
it was a complexion that under the influence of a blush would take on an orange tint
and this woman modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity of an age moreover when blushes are not expected had positively blushed before her daughter
in the privacy of a fourwheeler on her way to a charity cottage one of a row which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave she was forced to hid from her own child a blush of remorse and shame
whatever people will think
she knew very well what they did think the people winnie had in her mindthe old friends of her husband and others too whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success
she had not known before what a good beggar she could be
but she guessed very well what inference was drawn from her application
on account of that shrinking delicacy which exists side by side with aggressive brutality in masculine nature the inquiries into her circumstances had not been pushed very far
she had checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent
and the men would become suddenly incurious after the manner of their kind
she congratulated herself more than once on having nothing to do with women who being naturally more callous and avid of details would have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and soninlaw had driven her to that sad extremity
it was only before the secretary of the great brewer m p and chairman of the charity who acting for his principal felt bound to be conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the applicant that she had burst into tears outright and aloud as a cornered woman will weep
the thin and polite gentleman after contemplating her with an air of being struck all of a heap abandoned his position under the cover of soothing remarks
she must not distress herself
the deed of the charity did not absolutely specify childless widows  in fact it did not by any means disqualify her
but the discretion of the committee must be an informed discretion
one could understand very well her unwillingness to be a burden etc
etc
thereupon to his profound disappointment mrs verlocs mother wept some more with an augmented vehemence
the tears of that large female in a dark dusty wig and ancient silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace were the tears of genuine distress
she had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her children
girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of the boys
in this case she was sacrificing winnie
by the suppression of truth she was slandering her
of course winnie was independent and need not care for the opinion of people that she would never see and who would never see her whereas poor stevie had nothing in the world he could call his own except his mothers heroism and unscrupulousness
the first sense of security following on winnies marriage wore off in time for nothing lasts and mrs verlocs mother in the seclusion of the back bedroom had recalled the teaching of that experience which the world impresses upon a widowed woman
but she had recalled it without vain bitterness her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity
she reflected stoically that everything decays wears out in this world that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed that her daughter winnie was a most devoted sister and a very selfconfident wife indeed
as regards winnies sisterly devotion her stoicism flinched
she excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting all things human and some things divine
she could not help it not to do so would have frightened her too much
but in considering the conditions of her daughters married state she rejected firmly all flattering illusions
she took the cold and reasonable view that the less strain put on mr verlocs kindness the longer its effects were likely to last
that excellent man loved his wife of course but he would no doubt prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of that sentiment
it would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor stevie
and the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy
the virtue of this policy consisted in this mrs verlocs mother was subtle in her way that stevies moral claim would be strengthened
the poor boya good useful boy if a little peculiarhad not a sufficient standing
he had been taken over with his mother somewhat in the same way as the furniture of the belgravian mansion had been taken over as if on the ground of belonging to her exclusively
what will happen she asked herself for mrs verlocs mother was in a measure imaginative when i die
and when she asked herself that question it was with dread
it was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor boy
but by making him over to his sister by going thus away she gave him the advantage of a directly dependent position
this was the more subtle sanction of mrs verlocs mothers heroism and unscrupulousness
her act of abandonment was really an arrangement for settling her son permanently in life
other people made material sacrifices for such an object she in that way
it was the only way
moreover she would be able to see how it worked
ill or well she would avoid the horrible incertitude on the deathbed
but it was hard hard cruelly hard
the cab rattled jingled jolted in fact the last was quite extraordinary
by its disproportionate violence and magnitude it obliterated every sensation of onward movement and the effect was of being shaken in a stationary apparatus like a medival device for the punishment of crime or some very newfangled invention for the cure of a sluggish liver
it was extremely distressing and the raising of mrs verlocs mothers voice sounded like a wail of pain
i know my dear youll come to see me as often as you can spare the time
wont you  of course answered winnie shortly staring straight before her
and the cab jolted in front of a steamy greasy shop in a blaze of gas and in the smell of fried fish
the old woman raised a wail again
and my dear i must see that poor boy every sunday
he wont mind spending the day with his old mother  winnie screamed out stolidly  mind
i should think not
that poor boy will miss you something cruel
i wish you had thought a little of that mother  not think of it
the heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient object like a billiard ball which had tried to jump out of her throat
winnie sat mute for a while pouting at the front of the cab then snapped out which was an unusual tone with her  i expect ill have a job with him at first hell be that restless  whatever you do dont let him worry your husband my dear  thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation
and the cab jolted
mrs verlocs mother expressed some misgivings
could stevie be trusted to come all that way alone
winnie maintained that he was much less absentminded now
they agreed as to that
it could not be denied
much lesshardly at all
they shouted at each other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness
but suddenly the maternal anxiety broke out afresh
there were two omnibuses to take and a short walk between
it was too difficult
the old woman gave way to grief and consternation
winnie stared forward
dont you upset yourself like this mother
you must see him of course  no my dear
ill try not to  she mopped her streaming eyes
but you cant spare the time to come with him and if he should forget himself and lose his way and somebody spoke to him sharply his name and address may slip his memory and hell remain lost for days and days  the vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor stevieif only during inquirieswrung her heart
for she was a proud woman
winnies stare had grown hard intent inventive
i cant bring him to you myself every week she cried
but dont you worry mother
ill see to it that he dont get lost for long  they felt a peculiar bump a vision of brick pillars lingered before the rattling windows of the cab a sudden cessation of atrocious jolting and uproarious jingling dazed the two women
what had happened
they sat motionless and scared in the profound stillness till the door came open and a rough strained whispering was heard  here you are  a range of gabled little houses each with one dim yellow window on the ground floor surrounded the dark open space of a grass plot planted with shrubs and railed off from the patchwork of lights and shadows in the wide road resounding with the dull rumble of traffic
before the door of one of these tiny housesone without a light in the little downstairs windowthe cab had come to a standstill
mrs verlocs mother got out first backwards with a key in her hand
winnie lingered on the flagstone path to pay the cabman
stevie after helping to carry inside a lot of small parcels came out and stood under the light of a gaslamp belonging to the charity
the cabman looked at the pieces of silver which appearing very minute in his big grimy palm symbolised the insignificant results which reward the ambitious courage and toil of a mankind whose day is short on this earth of evil
he had been paid decentlyfour oneshilling piecesand he contemplated them in perfect stillness as if they had been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem
the slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing
his form was squat and without flexibility
stevie slender his shoulders a little up and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of his warm overcoat stood at the edge of the path pouting
the cabman pausing in his deliberate movements seemed struck by some misty recollection
oh
ere you are young fellow he whispered
youll know him againwont you  stevie was staring at the horse whose hind quarters appeared unduly elevated by the effect of emaciation
the little stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke and at the other end the thin flat neck like a plank covered with old horsehide drooped to the ground under the weight of an enormous bony head
the ears hung at different angles negligently and the macabre figure of that mute dweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the muggy stillness of the air
the cabman struck lightly stevies breast with the iron hook protruding from a ragged greasy sleeve
look ere young feller
owd you like to sit behind this oss up to two oclock in the morning praps  stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with rededged lids
he aint lame pursued the other whispering with energy
he aint got no sore places on im
ere he is
ow would you like  his strained extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of vehement secrecy
stevies vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread
you may well look
till three and four oclock in the morning
cold and ungry
looking for fares
drunks  his jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs and like virgils silenus who his face smeared with the juice of berries discoursed of olympian gods to the innocent shepherds of sicily he talked to stevie of domestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and immortality by no means assured
i am a night cabby i am he whispered with a sort of boastful exasperation
ive got to take out what they will blooming well give me at the yard
ive got my missus and four kids at ome  the monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike the world dumb
a silence reigned during which the flanks of the old horse the steed of apocalyptic misery smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gaslamp
the cabman grunted then added in his mysterious whisper  this aint an easy world  stevies face had been twitching for some time and at last his feelings burst out in their usual concise form
bad
bad  his gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse selfconscious and sombre as though he were afraid to look about him at the badness of the world
and his slenderness his rosy lips and pale clear complexion gave him the aspect of a delicate boy notwithstanding the fluffy growth of golden hair on his cheeks
he pouted in a scared way like a child
the cabman short and broad eyed him with his fierce little eyes that seemed to smart in a clear and corroding liquid
ard on osses but dam sight arder on poor chaps like me he wheezed just audibly
poor
poor stammered out stevie pushing his hands deeper into his pockets with convulsive sympathy
he could say nothing for the tenderness to all pain and all misery the desire to make the horse happy and the cabman happy had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take them to bed with him
and that he knew was impossible
for stevie was not mad
it was as it were a symbolic longing and at the same time it was very distinct because springing from experience the mother of wisdom
thus when as a child he cowered in a dark corner scared wretched sore and miserable with the black black misery of the soul his sister winnie used to come along and carry him off to bed with her as into a heaven of consoling peace
stevie though apt to forget mere facts such as his name and address for instance had a faithful memory of sensations
to be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application on a large scale
and looking at the cabman stevie perceived this clearly because he was reasonable
the cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if stevie had not existed
he made as if to hoist himself on the box but at the last moment from some obscure motive perhaps merely from disgust with carriage exercise desisted
he approached instead the motionless partner of his labours and stooping to seize the bridle lifted up the big weary head to the height of his shoulder with one effort of his right arm like a feat of strength
come on he whispered secretly
limping he led the cab away
there was an air of austerity in this departure the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly turning wheels the horses lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation away from the light into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly by the pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little almshouses
the plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the drive
between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege reappeared lighted up for a moment the short thick man limping busily with the horses head held aloft in his fist the lank animal walking in stiff and forlorn dignity the dark low box on wheels rolling behind comically with an air of waddling
they turned to the left
there was a pub down the street within fifty yards of the gate
stevie left alone beside the private lamppost of the charity his hands thrust deep into his pockets glared with vacant sulkiness
at the bottom of his pockets his incapable weak hands were clinched hard into a pair of angry fists
in the face of anything which affected directly or indirectly his morbid dread of pain stevie ended by turning vicious
a magnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting and caused his candid eyes to squint
supremely wise in knowing his own powerlessness stevie was not wise enough to restrain his passions
the tenderness of his universal charity had two phases as indissolubly joined and connected as the reverse and obverse sides of a medal
the anguish of immoderate compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but pitiless rage
those two states expressing themselves outwardly by the same signs of futile bodily agitation his sister winnie soothed his excitement without ever fathoming its twofold character
mrs verloc wasted no portion of this transient life in seeking for fundamental information
this is a sort of economy having all the appearances and some of the advantages of prudence
obviously it may be good for one not to know too much
and such a view accords very well with constitutional indolence
on that evening on which it may be said that mrs verlocs mother having parted for good from her children had also departed this life winnie verloc did not investigate her brothers psychology
the poor boy was excited of course
after once more assuring the old woman on the threshold that she would know how to guard against the risk of stevie losing himself for very long on his pilgrimages of filial piety she took her brothers arm to walk away
stevie did not even mutter to himself but with the special sense of sisterly devotion developed in her earliest infancy she felt that the boy was very much excited indeed
holding tight to his arm under the appearance of leaning on it she thought of some words suitable to the occasion
now stevie you must look well after me at the crossings and get first into the bus like a good brother  this appeal to manly protection was received by stevie with his usual docility
it flattered him
he raised his head and threw out his chest
dont be nervous winnie
mustnt be nervous
bus all right he answered in a brusque slurring stammer partaking of the timorousness of a child and the resolution of a man
he advanced fearlessly with the woman on his arm but his lower lip dropped
nevertheless on the pavement of the squalid and wide thoroughfare whose poverty in all the amenities of life stood foolishly exposed by a mad profusion of gaslights their resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to strike the casual passersby
before the doors of the publichouse at the corner where the profusion of gaslight reached the height of positive wickedness a fourwheeled cab standing by the curbstone with no one on the box seemed cast out into the gutter on account of irremediable decay
mrs verloc recognised the conveyance
its aspect was so profoundly lamentable with such a perfection of grotesque misery and weirdness of macabre detail as if it were the cab of death itself that mrs verloc with that ready compassion of a woman for a horse when she is not sitting behind him exclaimed vaguely  poor brute  hanging back suddenly stevie inflicted an arresting jerk upon his sister
poor
poor he ejaculated appreciatively
cabman poor too
he told me himself  the contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame him
jostled but obstinate he would remain there trying to express the view newly opened to his sympathies of the human and equine misery in close association
but it was very difficult
poor brute poor people was all he could repeat
it did not seem forcible enough and he came to a stop with an angry splutter shame  stevie was no master of phrases and perhaps for that very reason his thoughts lacked clearness and precision
but he felt with greater completeness and some profundity
that little word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one sort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the otherat the poor cabman beating the poor horse in the name as it were of his poor kids at home
and stevie knew what it was to be beaten
he knew it from experience
it was a bad world
bad
bad
mrs verloc his only sister guardian and protector could not pretend to such depths of insight
moreover she had not experienced the magic of the cabmans eloquence
she was in the dark as to the inwardness of the word shame  and she said placidly  come along stevie
you cant help that  the docile stevie went along but now he went along without pride shamblingly and muttering half words and even words that would have been whole if they had not been made up of halves that did not belong to each other
it was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he could remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of corresponding idea
and as a matter of fact he got it at last
he hung back to utter it at once
bad world for poor people  directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was familiar to him already in all its consequences
this circumstance strengthened his conviction immensely but also augmented his indignation
somebody he felt ought to be punished for itpunished with great severity
being no sceptic but a moral creature he was in a manner at the mercy of his righteous passions
beastly he added concisely
it was clear to mrs verloc that he was greatly excited
nobody can help that she said
do come along
is that the way youre taking care of me  stevie mended his pace obediently
he prided himself on being a good brother
his morality which was very complete demanded that from him
yet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister winnie who was good
nobody could help that
he came along gloomily but presently he brightened up
like the rest of mankind perplexed by the mystery of the universe he had his moments of consoling trust in the organised powers of the earth
police he suggested confidently
the police arent for that observed mrs verloc cursorily hurrying on her way
stevies face lengthened considerably
he was thinking
the more intense his thinking the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw
and it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his intellectual enterprise
not for that he mumbled resigned but surprised
not for that  he had formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as a sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil
the notion of benevolence especially was very closely associated with his sense of the power of the men in blue
he had liked all police constables tenderly with a guileless trustfulness
and he was pained
he was irritated too by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the force
for stevie was frank and as open as the day himself
what did they mean by pretending then
unlike his sister who put her trust in face values he wished to go to the bottom of the matter
he carried on his inquiry by means of an angry challenge
what for are they then winn
what are they for
tell me  winnie disliked controversy
but fearing most a fit of black depression consequent on stevie missing his mother very much at first she did not altogether decline the discussion
guiltless of all irony she answered yet in a form which was not perhaps unnatural in the wife of mr verloc delegate of the central red committee personal friend of certain anarchists and a votary of social revolution
dont you know what the police are for stevie
they are there so that them as have nothing shouldnt take anything away from them who have  she avoided using the verb to steal because it always made her brother uncomfortable
for stevie was delicately honest
certain simple principles had been instilled into him so anxiously on account of his queerness that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him with horror
he had been always easily impressed by speeches
he was impressed and startled now and his intelligence was very alert
what he asked at once anxiously
not even if they were hungry
mustnt they  the two had paused in their walk
not if they were ever so said mrs verloc with the equanimity of a person untroubled by the problem of the distribution of wealth and exploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right colour
certainly not
but whats the use of talking about all that
you arent ever hungry  she cast a swift glance at the boy like a young man by her side
she saw him amiable attractive affectionate and only a little a very little peculiar
and she could not see him otherwise for he was connected with what there was of the salt of passion in her tasteless lifethe passion of indignation of courage of pity and even of selfsacrifice
she did not add and you arent likely ever to be as long as i live  but she might very well have done so since she had taken effectual steps to that end
mr verloc was a very good husband
it was her honest impression that nobody could help liking the boy
she cried out suddenly  quick stevie
stop that green bus  and stevie tremulous and important with his sister winnie on his arm flung up the other high above his head at the approaching bus with complete success
an hour afterwards mr verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper he was reading or at any rate looking at behind the counter and in the expiring clatter of the doorbell beheld winnie his wife enter and cross the shop on her way upstairs followed by stevie his brotherinlaw
the sight of his wife was agreeable to mr verloc
it was his idiosyncrasy
the figure of his brotherinlaw remained imperceptible to him because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had fallen like a veil between mr verloc and the appearances of the world of senses
he looked after his wife fixedly without a word as though she had been a phantom
his voice for home use was husky and placid but now it was heard not at all
it was not heard at supper to which he was called by his wife in the usual brief manner adolf  he sat down to consume it without conviction wearing his hat pushed far back on his head
it was not devotion to an outdoor life but the frequentation of foreign cafs which was responsible for that habit investing with a character of unceremonious impermanency mr verlocs steady fidelity to his own fireside
twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose without a word disappeared into the shop and came back silently
during these absences mrs verloc becoming acutely aware of the vacant place at her right hand missed her mother very much and stared stonily while stevie from the same reason kept on shuffling his feet as though the floor under the table were uncomfortably hot
when mr verloc returned to sit in his place like the very embodiment of silence the character of mrs verlocs stare underwent a subtle change and stevie ceased to fidget with his feet because of his great and awed regard for his sisters husband
he directed at him glances of respectful compassion
mr verloc was sorry
his sister winnie had impressed upon him in the omnibus that mr verloc would be found at home in a state of sorrow and must not be worried
his fathers anger the irritability of gentlemen lodgers and mr verlocs predisposition to immoderate grief had been the main sanctions of stevies selfrestraint
of these sentiments all easily provoked but not always easy to understand the last had the greatest moral efficiencybecause mr verloc was good
his mother and his sister had established that ethical fact on an unshakable foundation
they had established erected consecrated it behind mr verlocs back for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract morality
and mr verloc was not aware of it
it is but bare justice to him to say that he had no notion of appearing good to stevie
yet so it was
he was even the only man so qualified in stevies knowledge because the gentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have anything very distinct about them but perhaps their boots and as regards the disciplinary measures of his father the desolation of his mother and sister shrank from setting up a theory of goodness before the victim
it would have been too cruel
and it was even possible that stevie would not have believed them
as far as mr verloc was concerned nothing could stand in the way of stevies belief
mr verloc was obviously yet mysteriously good
and the grief of a good man is august
stevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his brotherinlaw
mr verloc was sorry
the brother of winnie had never before felt himself in such close communion with the mystery of that mans goodness
it was an understandable sorrow
and stevie himself was sorry
he was very sorry
the same sort of sorrow
and his attention being drawn to this unpleasant state stevie shuffled his feet
his feelings were habitually manifested by the agitation of his limbs
keep your feet quiet dear said mrs verloc with authority and tenderness then turning towards her husband in an indifferent voice the masterly achievement of instinctive tact are you going out tonight she asked
the mere suggestion seemed repugnant to mr verloc
he shook his head moodily and then sat still with downcast eyes looking at the piece of cheese on his plate for a whole minute
at the end of that time he got up and went outwent right out in the clatter of the shopdoor bell
he acted thus inconsistently not from any desire to make himself unpleasant but because of an unconquerable restlessness
it was no earthly good going out
he could not find anywhere in london what he wanted
but he went out
he led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark streets through lighted streets in and out of two flash bars as if in a halfhearted attempt to make a night of it and finally back again to his menaced home where he sat down fatigued behind the counter and they crowded urgently round him like a pack of hungry black hounds
after locking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with hima dreadful escort for a man going to bed
his wife had preceded him some time before and with her ample form defined vaguely under the counterpane her head on the pillow and a hand under the cheek offered to his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of an equable soul
her big eyes stared wide open inert and dark against the snowy whiteness of the linen
she did not move
she had an equable soul
she felt profoundly that things do not stand much looking into
she made her force and her wisdom of that instinct
but the taciturnity of mr verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a good many days
it was as a matter of fact affecting her nerves
recumbent and motionless she said placidly  youll catch cold walking about in your socks like this  this speech becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the woman took mr verloc unawares
he had left his boots downstairs but he had forgotten to put on his slippers and he had been turning about the bedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage
at the sound of his wifes voice he stopped and stared at her with a somnambulistic expressionless gaze so long that mrs verloc moved her limbs slightly under the bedclothes
but she did not move her black head sunk in the white pillow one hand under her cheek and the big dark unwinking eyes
under her husbands expressionless stare and remembering her mothers empty room across the landing she felt an acute pang of loneliness
she had never been parted from her mother before
they had stood by each other
she felt that they had and she said to herself that now mother was gonegone for good
mrs verloc had no illusions
stevie remained however
and she said  mothers done what she wanted to do
theres no sense in it that i can see
im sure she couldnt have thought you had enough of her
its perfectly wicked leaving us like that  mr verloc was not a wellread person his range of allusive phrases was limited but there was a peculiar aptness in circumstances which made him think of rats leaving a doomed ship
he very nearly said so
he had grown suspicious and embittered
could it be that the old woman had such an excellent nose
but the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was patent and mr verloc held his tongue
not altogether however
he muttered heavily  perhaps its just as well  he began to undress
mrs verloc kept very still perfectly still with her eyes fixed in a dreamy quiet stare
and her heart for the fraction of a second seemed to stand still too
that night she was not quite herself as the saying is and it was borne upon her with some force that a simple sentence may hold several diverse meaningsmostly disagreeable
how was it just as well
and why
but she did not allow herself to fall into the idleness of barren speculation
she was rather confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into
practical and subtle in her way she brought stevie to the front without loss of time because in her the singleness of purpose had the unerring nature and the force of an instinct
what i am going to do to cheer up that boy for the first few days im sure i dont know
hell be worrying himself from morning till night before he gets used to mother being away
and hes such a good boy
i couldnt do without him  mr verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the unnoticing inward concentration of a man undressing in the solitude of a vast and hopeless desert
for thus inhospitably did this fair earth our common inheritance present itself to the mental vision of mr verloc
all was so still without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the landing stole into the room as if for the sake of company
mr verloc getting into bed on his own side remained prone and mute behind mrs verlocs back
his thick arms rested abandoned on the outside of the counterpane like dropped weapons like discarded tools
at that moment he was within a hairs breadth of making a clean breast of it all to his wife
the moment seemed propitious
looking out of the corners of his eyes he saw her ample shoulders draped in white the back of her head with the hair done for the night in three plaits tied up with black tapes at the ends
and he forbore
mr verloc loved his wife as a wife should be lovedthat is maritally with the regard one has for ones chief possession
this head arranged for the night those ample shoulders had an aspect of familiar sacrednessthe sacredness of domestic peace
she moved not massive and shapeless like a recumbent statue in the rough he remembered her wideopen eyes looking into the empty room
she was mysterious with the mysteriousness of living beings
the farfamed secret agent delta of the late baron stottwartenheims alarmist despatches was not the man to break into such mysteries
he was easily intimidated
and he was also indolent with the indolence which is so often the secret of good nature
he forbore touching that mystery out of love timidity and indolence
there would be always time enough
for several minutes he bore his sufferings silently in the drowsy silence of the room
and then he disturbed it by a resolute declaration
i am going on the continent tomorrow  his wife might have fallen asleep already
he could not tell
as a matter of fact mrs verloc had heard him
her eyes remained very wide open and she lay very still confirmed in her instinctive conviction that things dont bear looking into very much
and yet it was nothing very unusual for mr verloc to take such a trip
he renewed his stock from paris and brussels
often he went over to make his purchases personally
a little select connection of amateurs was forming around the shop in brett street a secret connection eminently proper for any business undertaken by mr verloc who by a mystic accord of temperament and necessity had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life
he waited for a while then added ill be away a week or perhaps a fortnight
get mrs neale to come for the day  mrs neale was the charwoman of brett street
victim of her marriage with a debauched joiner she was oppressed by the needs of many infant children
redarmed and aproned in coarse sacking up to the armpits she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soapsuds and rum in the uproar of scrubbing in the clatter of tin pails
mrs verloc full of deep purpose spoke in the tone of the shallowest indifference
there is no need to have the woman here all day
i shall do very well with stevie  she let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the abyss of eternity and asked  shall i put the light out  mr verloc snapped at his wife huskily
put it out     chapter ix   mr verloc returning from the continent at the end of ten days brought back a mind evidently unrefreshed by the wonders of foreign travel and a countenance unlighted by the joys of homecoming
he entered in the clatter of the shop bell with an air of sombre and vexed exhaustion
his bag in hand his head lowered he strode straight behind the counter and let himself fall into the chair as though he had tramped all the way from dover
it was early morning
stevie dusting various objects displayed in the front windows turned to gape at him with reverence and awe
here said mr verloc giving a slight kick to the gladstone bag on the floor and stevie flung himself upon it seized it bore it off with triumphant devotion
he was so prompt that mr verloc was distinctly surprised
already at the clatter of the shop bell mrs neale blackleading the parlour grate had looked through the door and rising from her knees had gone aproned and grimy with everlasting toil to tell mrs verloc in the kitchen that there was the master come back  winnie came no farther than the inner shop door
youll want some breakfast she said from a distance
mr verloc moved his hands slightly as if overcome by an impossible suggestion
but once enticed into the parlour he did not reject the food set before him
he ate as if in a public place his hat pushed off his forehead the skirts of his heavy overcoat hanging in a triangle on each side of the chair
and across the length of the table covered with brown oilcloth winnie his wife talked evenly at him the wifely talk as artfully adapted no doubt to the circumstances of this return as the talk of penelope to the return of the wandering odysseus
mrs verloc however had done no weaving during her husbands absence
but she had had all the upstairs room cleaned thoroughly had sold some wares had seen mr michaelis several times
he had told her the last time that he was going away to live in a cottage in the country somewhere on the london chatham and dover line
karl yundt had come too once led under the arm by that wicked old housekeeper of his  he was a disgusting old man  of comrade ossipon whom she had received curtly entrenched behind the counter with a stony face and a faraway gaze she said nothing her mental reference to the robust anarchist being marked by a short pause with the faintest possible blush
and bringing in her brother stevie as soon as she could into the current of domestic events she mentioned that the boy had moped a good deal
its all along of mother leaving us like this  mr verloc neither said damn nor yet stevie be hanged  and mrs verloc not let into the secret of his thoughts failed to appreciate the generosity of this restraint
it isnt that he doesnt work as well as ever she continued
hes been making himself very useful
youd think he couldnt do enough for us  mr verloc directed a casual and somnolent glance at stevie who sat on his right delicate palefaced his rosy mouth open vacantly
it was not a critical glance
it had no intention
and if mr verloc thought for a moment that his wifes brother looked uncommonly useless it was only a dull and fleeting thought devoid of that force and durability which enables sometimes a thought to move the world
leaning back mr verloc uncovered his head
before his extended arm could put down the hat stevie pounced upon it and bore it off reverently into the kitchen
and again mr verloc was surprised
you could do anything with that boy adolf mrs verloc said with her best air of inflexible calmness
he would go through fire for you
he  she paused attentive her ear turned towards the door of the kitchen
there mrs neale was scrubbing the floor
at stevies appearance she groaned lamentably having observed that he could be induced easily to bestow for the benefit of her infant children the shilling his sister winnie presented him with from time to time
on all fours amongst the puddles wet and begrimed like a sort of amphibious and domestic animal living in ashbins and dirty water she uttered the usual exordium its all very well for you kept doing nothing like a gentleman  and she followed it with the everlasting plaint of the poor pathetically mendacious miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soapsuds
she scrubbed hard snuffling all the time and talking volubly
and she was sincere
and on each side of her thin red nose her bleared misty eyes swam in tears because she felt really the want of some sort of stimulant in the morning
in the parlour mrs verloc observed with knowledge  theres mrs neale at it again with her harrowing tales about her little children
they cant be all so little as she makes them out
some of them must be big enough by now to try to do something for themselves
it only makes stevie angry  these words were confirmed by a thud as of a fist striking the kitchen table
in the normal evolution of his sympathy stevie had become angry on discovering that he had no shilling in his pocket
in his inability to relieve at once mrs neales little uns privations he felt that somebody should be made to suffer for it
mrs verloc rose and went into the kitchen to stop that nonsense  and she did it firmly but gently
she was well aware that directly mrs neale received her money she went round the corner to drink ardent spirits in a mean and musty publichousethe unavoidable station on the via dolorosa of her life
mrs verlocs comment upon this practice had an unexpected profundity as coming from a person disinclined to look under the surface of things
of course what is she to do to keep up
if i were like mrs neale i expect i wouldnt act any different  in the afternoon of the same day as mr verloc coming with a start out of the last of a long series of dozes before the parlour fire declared his intention of going out for a walk winnie said from the shop  i wish you would take that boy out with you adolf  for the third time that day mr verloc was surprised
he stared stupidly at his wife
she continued in her steady manner
the boy whenever he was not doing anything moped in the house
it made her uneasy it made her nervous she confessed
and that from the calm winnie sounded like exaggeration
but in truth stevie moped in the striking fashion of an unhappy domestic animal
he would go up on the dark landing to sit on the floor at the foot of the tall clock with his knees drawn up and his head in his hands
to come upon his pallid face with its big eyes gleaming in the dusk was discomposing to think of him up there was uncomfortable
mr verloc got used to the startling novelty of the idea
he was fond of his wife as a man should bethat is generously
but a weighty objection presented itself to his mind and he formulated it
hell lose sight of me perhaps and get lost in the street he said
mrs verloc shook her head competently
he wont
you dont know him
that boy just worships you
but if you should miss him  mrs verloc paused for a moment but only for a moment
you just go on and have your walk out
dont worry
hell be all right
hes sure to turn up safe here before very long  this optimism procured for mr verloc his fourth surprise of the day
is he he grunted doubtfully
but perhaps his brotherinlaw was not such an idiot as he looked
his wife would know best
he turned away his heavy eyes saying huskily well let him come along then and relapsed into the clutches of black care that perhaps prefers to sit behind a horseman but knows also how to tread close on the heels of people not sufficiently well off to keep horseslike mr verloc for instance
winnie at the shop door did not see this fatal attendant upon mr verlocs walks
she watched the two figures down the squalid street one tall and burly the other slight and short with a thin neck and the peaked shoulders raised slightly under the large semitransparent ears
the material of their overcoats was the same their hats were black and round in shape
inspired by the similarity of wearing apparel mrs verloc gave rein to her fancy
might be father and son she said to herself
she thought also that mr verloc was as much of a father as poor stevie ever had in his life
she was aware also that it was her work
and with peaceful pride she congratulated herself on a certain resolution she had taken a few years before
it had cost her some effort and even a few tears
she congratulated herself still more on observing in the course of days that mr verloc seemed to be taking kindly to stevies companionship
now when ready to go out for his walk mr verloc called aloud to the boy in the spirit no doubt in which a man invites the attendance of the household dog though of course in a different manner
in the house mr verloc could be detected staring curiously at stevie a good deal
his own demeanour had changed
taciturn still he was not so listless
mrs verloc thought that he was rather jumpy at times
it might have been regarded as an improvement
as to stevie he moped no longer at the foot of the clock but muttered to himself in corners instead in a threatening tone
when asked what is it youre saying stevie he merely opened his mouth and squinted at his sister
at odd times he clenched his fists without apparent cause and when discovered in solitude would be scowling at the wall with the sheet of paper and the pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the kitchen table
this was a change but it was no improvement
mrs verloc including all these vagaries under the general definition of excitement began to fear that stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her husbands conversations with his friends
during his walks mr verloc of course met and conversed with various persons
it could hardly be otherwise
his walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities which his wife had never looked deeply into
mrs verloc felt that the position was delicate but she faced it with the same impenetrable calmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop and made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly
no
she feared that there were things not good for stevie to hear of she told her husband
it only excited the poor boy because he could not help them being so
nobody could
it was in the shop
mr verloc made no comment
he made no retort and yet the retort was obvious
but he refrained from pointing out to his wife that the idea of making stevie the companion of his walks was her own and nobody elses
at that moment to an impartial observer mr verloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity
he took down a small cardboard box from a shelf peeped in to see that the contents were all right and put it down gently on the counter
not till that was done did he break the silence to the effect that most likely stevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while only he supposed his wife could not get on without him
could not get on without him repeated mrs verloc slowly
i couldnt get on without him if it were for his good
the idea
of course i can get on without him
but theres nowhere for him to go  mr verloc got out some brown paper and a ball of string and meanwhile he muttered that michaelis was living in a little cottage in the country
michaelis wouldnt mind giving stevie a room to sleep in
there were no visitors and no talk there
michaelis was writing a book
mrs verloc declared her affection for michaelis mentioned her abhorrence of karl yundt nasty old man and of ossipon she said nothing
as to stevie he could be no other than very pleased
mr michaelis was always so nice and kind to him
he seemed to like the boy
well the boy was a good boy
you too seem to have grown quite fond of him of late she added after a pause with her inflexible assurance
mr verloc tying up the cardboard box into a parcel for the post broke the string by an injudicious jerk and muttered several swear words confidentially to himself
then raising his tone to the usual husky mutter he announced his willingness to take stevie into the country himself and leave him all safe with michaelis
he carried out this scheme on the very next day
stevie offered no objection
he seemed rather eager in a bewildered sort of way
he turned his candid gaze inquisitively to mr verlocs heavy countenance at frequent intervals especially when his sister was not looking at him
his expression was proud apprehensive and concentrated like that of a small child entrusted for the first time with a box of matches and the permission to strike a light
but mrs verloc gratified by her brothers docility recommended him not to dirty his clothes unduly in the country
at this stevie gave his sister guardian and protector a look which for the first time in his life seemed to lack the quality of perfect childlike trustfulness
it was haughtily gloomy
mrs verloc smiled
goodness me
you neednt be offended
you know you do get yourself very untidy when you get a chance stevie  mr verloc was already gone some way down the street
thus in consequence of her mothers heroic proceedings and of her brothers absence on this villegiature mrs verloc found herself oftener than usual all alone not only in the shop but in the house
for mr verloc had to take his walks
she was alone longer than usual on the day of the attempted bomb outrage in greenwich park because mr verloc went out very early that morning and did not come back till nearly dusk
she did not mind being alone
she had no desire to go out
the weather was too bad and the shop was cosier than the streets
sitting behind the counter with some sewing she did not raise her eyes from her work when mr verloc entered in the aggressive clatter of the bell
she had recognised his step on the pavement outside
she did not raise her eyes but as mr verloc silent and with his hat rammed down upon his forehead made straight for the parlour door she said serenely  what a wretched day
youve been perhaps to see stevie  no
i havent said mr verloc softly and slammed the glazed parlour door behind him with unexpected energy
for some time mrs verloc remained quiescent with her work dropped in her lap before she put it away under the counter and got up to light the gas
this done she went into the parlour on her way to the kitchen
mr verloc would want his tea presently
confident of the power of her charms winnie did not expect from her husband in the daily intercourse of their married life a ceremonious amenity of address and courtliness of manner vain and antiquated forms at best probably never very exactly observed discarded nowadays even in the highest spheres and always foreign to the standards of her class
she did not look for courtesies from him
but he was a good husband and she had a loyal respect for his rights
mrs verloc would have gone through the parlour and on to her domestic duties in the kitchen with the perfect serenity of a woman sure of the power of her charms
but a slight very slight and rapid rattling sound grew upon her hearing
bizarre and incomprehensible it arrested mrs verlocs attention
then as its character became plain to the ear she stopped short amazed and concerned
striking a match on the box she held in her hand she turned on and lighted above the parlour table one of the two gasburners which being defective first whistled as if astonished and then went on purring comfortably like a cat
mr verloc against his usual practice had thrown off his overcoat
it was lying on the sofa
his hat which he must also have thrown off rested overturned under the edge of the sofa
he had dragged a chair in front of the fireplace and his feet planted inside the fender his head held between his hands he was hanging low over the glowing grate
his teeth rattled with an ungovernable violence causing his whole enormous back to tremble at the same rate
mrs verloc was startled
youve been getting wet she said
not very mr verloc managed to falter out in a profound shudder
by a great effort he suppressed the rattling of his teeth
ill have you laid up on my hands she said with genuine uneasiness
i dont think so remarked mr verloc snuffling huskily
he had certainly contrived somehow to catch an abominable cold between seven in the morning and five in the afternoon
mrs verloc looked at his bowed back
where have you been today she asked
nowhere answered mr verloc in a low choked nasal tone
his attitude suggested aggrieved sulks or a severe headache
the unsufficiency and uncandidness of his answer became painfully apparent in the dead silence of the room
he snuffled apologetically and added ive been to the bank  mrs verloc became attentive
you have she said dispassionately
what for  mr verloc mumbled with his nose over the grate and with marked unwillingness
draw the money out  what do you mean
all of it  yes
all of it  mrs verloc spread out with care the scanty tablecloth got two knives and two forks out of the table drawer and suddenly stopped in her methodical proceedings
what did you do that for  may want it soon snuffled vaguely mr verloc who was coming to the end of his calculated indiscretions
i dont know what you mean remarked his wife in a tone perfectly casual but standing stock still between the table and the cupboard
you know you can trust me mr verloc remarked to the grate with hoarse feeling
mrs verloc turned slowly towards the cupboard saying with deliberation  oh yes
i can trust you  and she went on with her methodical proceedings
she laid two plates got the bread the butter going to and fro quietly between the table and the cupboard in the peace and silence of her home
on the point of taking out the jam she reflected practically he will be feeling hungry having been away all day and she returned to the cupboard once more to get the cold beef
she set it under the purring gasjet and with a passing glance at her motionless husband hugging the fire she went down two steps into the kitchen
it was only when coming back carving knife and fork in hand that she spoke again
if i hadnt trusted you i wouldnt have married you  bowed under the overmantel mr verloc holding his head in both hands seemed to have gone to sleep
winnie made the tea and called out in an undertone  adolf  mr verloc got up at once and staggered a little before he sat down at the table
his wife examining the sharp edge of the carving knife placed it on the dish and called his attention to the cold beef
he remained insensible to the suggestion with his chin on his breast
you should feed your cold mrs verloc said dogmatically
he looked up and shook his head
his eyes were bloodshot and his face red
his fingers had ruffled his hair into a dissipated untidiness
altogether he had a disreputable aspect expressive of the discomfort the irritation and the gloom following a heavy debauch
but mr verloc was not a debauched man
in his conduct he was respectable
his appearance might have been the effect of a feverish cold
he drank three cups of tea but abstained from food entirely
he recoiled from it with sombre aversion when urged by mrs verloc who said at last  arent your feet wet
you had better put on your slippers
you arent going out any more this evening  mr verloc intimated by morose grunts and signs that his feet were not wet and that anyhow he did not care
the proposal as to slippers was disregarded as beneath his notice
but the question of going out in the evening received an unexpected development
it was not of going out in the evening that mr verloc was thinking
his thoughts embraced a vaster scheme
from moody and incomplete phrases it became apparent that mr verloc had been considering the expediency of emigrating
it was not very clear whether he had in his mind france or california
the utter unexpectedness improbability and inconceivableness of such an event robbed this vague declaration of all its effect
mrs verloc as placidly as if her husband had been threatening her with the end of the world said  the idea  mr verloc declared himself sick and tired of everything and besidesshe interrupted him
youve a bad cold  it was indeed obvious that mr verloc was not in his usual state physically and even mentally
a sombre irresolution held him silent for a while
then he murmured a few ominous generalities on the theme of necessity
will have to repeated winnie sitting calmly back with folded arms opposite her husband
i should like to know whos to make you
you aint a slave
no one need be a slave in this countryand dont you make yourself one  she paused and with invincible and steady candour
the business isnt so bad she went on
youve a comfortable home  she glanced all round the parlour from the corner cupboard to the good fire in the grate
ensconced cosily behind the shop of doubtful wares with the mysteriously dim window and its door suspiciously ajar in the obscure and narrow street it was in all essentials of domestic propriety and domestic comfort a respectable home
her devoted affection missed out of it her brother stevie now enjoying a damp villegiature in the kentish lanes under the care of mr michaelis
she missed him poignantly with all the force of her protecting passion
this was the boys home toothe roof the cupboard the stoked grate
on this thought mrs verloc rose and walking to the other end of the table said in the fulness of her heart  and you are not tired of me  mr verloc made no sound
winnie leaned on his shoulder from behind and pressed her lips to his forehead
thus she lingered
not a whisper reached them from the outside world
the sound of footsteps on the pavement died out in the discreet dimness of the shop
only the gasjet above the table went on purring equably in the brooding silence of the parlour
during the contact of that unexpected and lingering kiss mr verloc gripping with both hands the edges of his chair preserved a hieratic immobility
when the pressure was removed he let go the chair rose and went to stand before the fireplace
he turned no longer his back to the room
with his features swollen and an air of being drugged he followed his wifes movements with his eyes
mrs verloc went about serenely clearing up the table
her tranquil voice commented the idea thrown out in a reasonable and domestic tone
it wouldnt stand examination
she condemned it from every point of view
but her only real concern was stevies welfare
he appeared to her thought in that connection as sufficiently peculiar not to be taken rashly abroad
and that was all
but talking round that vital point she approached absolute vehemence in her delivery
meanwhile with brusque movements she arrayed herself in an apron for the washing up of cups
and as if excited by the sound of her uncontradicted voice she went so far as to say in a tone almost tart  if you go abroad youll have to go without me  you know i wouldnt said mr verloc huskily and the unresonant voice of his private life trembled with an enigmatical emotion
already mrs verloc was regretting her words
they had sounded more unkind than she meant them to be
they had also the unwisdom of unnecessary things
in fact she had not meant them at all
it was a sort of phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration
but she knew a way to make it as if it had not been
she turned her head over her shoulder and gave that man planted heavily in front of the fireplace a glance half arch half cruel out of her large eyesa glance of which the winnie of the belgravian mansion days would have been incapable because of her respectability and her ignorance
but the man was her husband now and she was no longer ignorant
she kept it on him for a whole second with her grave face motionless like a mask while she said playfully  you couldnt
you would miss me too much  mr verloc started forward
exactly he said in a louder tone throwing his arms out and making a step towards her
something wild and doubtful in his expression made it appear uncertain whether he meant to strangle or to embrace his wife
but mrs verlocs attention was called away from that manifestation by the clatter of the shop bell
shop adolf
you go  he stopped his arms came down slowly
you go repeated mrs verloc
ive got my apron on  mr verloc obeyed woodenly stonyeyed and like an automaton whose face had been painted red
and this resemblance to a mechanical figure went so far that he had an automatons absurd air of being aware of the machinery inside of him
he closed the parlour door and mrs verloc moving briskly carried the tray into the kitchen
she washed the cups and some other things before she stopped in her work to listen
no sound reached her
the customer was a long time in the shop
it was a customer because if he had not been mr verloc would have taken him inside
undoing the strings of her apron with a jerk she threw it on a chair and walked back to the parlour slowly
at that precise moment mr verloc entered from the shop
he had gone in red
he came out a strange papery white
his face losing its drugged feverish stupor had in that short time acquired a bewildered and harassed expression
he walked straight to the sofa and stood looking down at his overcoat lying there as though he were afraid to touch it
whats the matter asked mrs verloc in a subdued voice
through the door left ajar she could see that the customer was not gone yet
i find ill have to go out this evening said mr verloc
he did not attempt to pick up his outer garment
without a word winnie made for the shop and shutting the door after her walked in behind the counter
she did not look overtly at the customer till she had established herself comfortably on the chair
but by that time she had noted that he was tall and thin and wore his moustaches twisted up
in fact he gave the sharp points a twist just then
his long bony face rose out of a turnedup collar
he was a little splashed a little wet
a dark man with the ridge of the cheekbone well defined under the slightly hollow temple
a complete stranger
not a customer either
mrs verloc looked at him placidly
you came over from the continent she said after a time
the long thin stranger without exactly looking at mrs verloc answered only by a faint and peculiar smile
mrs verlocs steady incurious gaze rested on him
you understand english dont you  oh yes
i understand english  there was nothing foreign in his accent except that he seemed in his slow enunciation to be taking pains with it
and mrs verloc in her varied experience had come to the conclusion that some foreigners could speak better english than the natives
she said looking at the door of the parlour fixedly  you dont think perhaps of staying in england for good  the stranger gave her again a silent smile
he had a kindly mouth and probing eyes
and he shook his head a little sadly it seemed
my husband will see you through all right
meantime for a few days you couldnt do better than take lodgings with mr giugliani
continental hotel its called
private
its quiet
my husband will take you there  a good idea said the thin dark man whose glance had hardened suddenly
you knew mr verloc beforedidnt you
perhaps in france  i have heard of him admitted the visitor in his slow painstaking tone which yet had a certain curtness of intention
there was a pause
then he spoke again in a far less elaborate manner
your husband has not gone out to wait for me in the street by chance  in the street repeated mrs verloc surprised
he couldnt
theres no other door to the house  for a moment she sat impassive then left her seat to go and peep through the glazed door
suddenly she opened it and disappeared into the parlour
mr verloc had done no more than put on his overcoat
but why he should remain afterwards leaning over the table propped up on his two arms as though he were feeling giddy or sick she could not understand
adolf she called out half aloud and when he had raised himself  do you know that man she asked rapidly
ive heard of him whispered uneasily mr verloc darting a wild glance at the door
mrs verlocs fine incurious eyes lighted up with a flash of abhorrence
one of karl yundts friendsbeastly old man  no
no protested mr verloc busy fishing for his hat
but when he got it from under the sofa he held it as if he did not know the use of a hat
wellhes waiting for you said mrs verloc at last
i say adolf he aint one of them embassy people you have been bothered with of late  bothered with embassy people repeated mr verloc with a heavy start of surprise and fear
whos been talking to you of the embassy people  yourself  i
i
talked of the embassy to you  mr verloc seemed scared and bewildered beyond measure
his wife explained  youve been talking a little in your sleep of late adolf  whatwhat did i say
what do you know  nothing much
it seemed mostly nonsense
enough to let me guess that something worried you  mr verloc rammed his hat on his head
a crimson flood of anger ran over his face
nonsenseeh
the embassy people
i would cut their hearts out one after another
but let them look out
ive got a tongue in my head  he fumed pacing up and down between the table and the sofa his open overcoat catching against the angles
the red flood of anger ebbed out and left his face all white with quivering nostrils
mrs verloc for the purposes of practical existence put down these appearances to the cold
well she said get rid of the man whoever he is as soon as you can and come back home to me
you want looking after for a day or two  mr verloc calmed down and with resolution imprinted on his pale face had already opened the door when his wife called him back in a whisper  adolf
adolf  he came back startled
what about that money you drew out she asked
youve got it in your pocket
hadnt you better  mr verloc gazed stupidly into the palm of his wifes extended hand for some time before he slapped his brow
money
yes
yes
i didnt know what you meant  he drew out of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocketbook
mrs verloc received it without another word and stood still till the bell clattering after mr verloc and mr verlocs visitor had quieted down
only then she peeped in at the amount drawing the notes out for the purpose
after this inspection she looked round thoughtfully with an air of mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house
this abode of her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe as though it had been situated in the midst of a forest
no receptacle she could think of amongst the solid heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and particularly tempting to her conception of a housebreaker
it was an ideal conception endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous insight
the till was not to be thought of
it was the first spot a thief would make for
mrs verloc unfastening hastily a couple of hooks slipped the pocketbook under the bodice of her dress
having thus disposed of her husbands capital she was rather glad to hear the clatter of the door bell announcing an arrival
assuming the fixed unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual customer she walked in behind the counter
a man standing in the middle of the shop was inspecting it with a swift cool allround glance
his eyes ran over the walls took in the ceiling noted the floorall in a moment
the points of a long fair moustache fell below the line of the jaw
he smiled the smile of an old if distant acquaintance and mrs verloc remembered having seen him before
not a customer
she softened her customer stare to mere indifference and faced him across the counter
he approached on his side confidentially but not too markedly so
husband at home mrs verloc he asked in an easy full tone
no
hes gone out  i am sorry for that
ive called to get from him a little private information  this was the exact truth
chief inspector heat had been all the way home and had even gone so far as to think of getting into his slippers since practically he was he told himself chucked out of that case
he indulged in some scornful and in a few angry thoughts and found the occupation so unsatisfactory that he resolved to seek relief out of doors
nothing prevented him paying a friendly call to mr verloc casually as it were
it was in the character of a private citizen that walking out privately he made use of his customary conveyances
their general direction was towards mr verlocs home
chief inspector heat respected his own private character so consistently that he took especial pains to avoid all the police constables on point and patrol duty in the vicinity of brett street
this precaution was much more necessary for a man of his standing than for an obscure assistant commissioner
private citizen heat entered the street manoeuvring in a way which in a member of the criminal classes would have been stigmatised as slinking
the piece of cloth picked up in greenwich was in his pocket
not that he had the slightest intention of producing it in his private capacity
on the contrary he wanted to know just what mr verloc would be disposed to say voluntarily
he hoped mr verlocs talk would be of a nature to incriminate michaelis
it was a conscientiously professional hope in the main but not without its moral value
for chief inspector heat was a servant of justice
finding mr verloc from home he felt disappointed
i would wait for him a little if i were sure he wouldnt be long he said
mrs verloc volunteered no assurance of any kind
the information i need is quite private he repeated
you understand what i mean
i wonder if you could give me a notion where hes gone to  mrs verloc shook her head
cant say  she turned away to range some boxes on the shelves behind the counter
chief inspector heat looked at her thoughtfully for a time
i suppose you know who i am he said
mrs verloc glanced over her shoulder
chief inspector heat was amazed at her coolness
come
you know i am in the police he said sharply
i dont trouble my head much about it mrs verloc remarked returning to the ranging of her boxes
my name is heat
chief inspector heat of the special crimes section  mrs verloc adjusted nicely in its place a small cardboard box and turning round faced him again heavyeyed with idle hands hanging down
a silence reigned for a time
so your husband went out a quarter of an hour ago
and he didnt say when he would be back  he didnt go out alone mrs verloc let fall negligently
a friend  mrs verloc touched the back of her hair
it was in perfect order
a stranger who called  i see
what sort of man was that stranger
would you mind telling me  mrs verloc did not mind
and when chief inspector heat heard of a man dark thin with a long face and turned up moustaches he gave signs of perturbation and exclaimed  dash me if i didnt think so
he hasnt lost any time  he was intensely disgusted in the secrecy of his heart at the unofficial conduct of his immediate chief
but he was not quixotic
he lost all desire to await mr verlocs return
what they had gone out for he did not know but he imagined it possible that they would return together
the case is not followed properly its being tampered with he thought bitterly
i am afraid i havent time to wait for your husband he said
mrs verloc received this declaration listlessly
her detachment had impressed chief inspector heat all along
at this precise moment it whetted his curiosity
chief inspector heat hung in the wind swayed by his passions like the most private of citizens
i think he said looking at her steadily that you could give me a pretty good notion of whats going on if you liked  forcing her fine inert eyes to return his gaze mrs verloc murmured  going on
what is going on  why the affair i came to talk about a little with your husband  that day mrs verloc had glanced at a morning paper as usual
but she had not stirred out of doors
the newsboys never invaded brett street
it was not a street for their business
and the echo of their cries drifting along the populous thoroughfares expired between the dirty brick walls without reaching the threshold of the shop
her husband had not brought an evening paper home
at any rate she had not seen it
mrs verloc knew nothing whatever of any affair
and she said so with a genuine note of wonder in her quiet voice
chief inspector heat did not believe for a moment in so much ignorance
curtly without amiability he stated the bare fact
mrs verloc turned away her eyes
i call it silly she pronounced slowly
she paused
we aint downtrodden slaves here  the chief inspector waited watchfully
nothing more came
and your husband didnt mention anything to you when he came home  mrs verloc simply turned her face from right to left in sign of negation
a languid baffling silence reigned in the shop
chief inspector heat felt provoked beyond endurance
there was another small matter he began in a detached tone which i wanted to speak to your husband about
there came into our hands aawhat we believe isa stolen overcoat  mrs verloc with her mind specially aware of thieves that evening touched lightly the bosom of her dress
we have lost no overcoat she said calmly
thats funny continued private citizen heat
i see you keep a lot of marking ink here  he took up a small bottle and looked at it against the gasjet in the middle of the shop
purpleisnt it he remarked setting it down again
as i said its strange
because the overcoat has got a label sewn on the inside with your address written in marking ink  mrs verloc leaned over the counter with a low exclamation
thats my brothers then  wheres your brother
can i see him asked the chief inspector briskly
mrs verloc leaned a little more over the counter
no
he isnt here
i wrote that label myself  wheres your brother now  hes been away living witha friendin the country  the overcoat comes from the country
and whats the name of the friend  michaelis confessed mrs verloc in an awed whisper
the chief inspector let out a whistle
his eyes snapped
just so
capital
and your brother now whats he likea sturdy darkish chapeh  oh no exclaimed mrs verloc fervently
that must be the thief
stevies slight and fair  good said the chief inspector in an approving tone
and while mrs verloc wavering between alarm and wonder stared at him he sought for information
why have the address sewn like this inside the coat
and he heard that the mangled remains he had inspected that morning with extreme repugnance were those of a youth nervous absentminded peculiar and also that the woman who was speaking to him had had the charge of that boy since he was a baby
easily excitable he suggested
oh yes
he is
but how did he come to lose his coat  chief inspector heat suddenly pulled out a pink newspaper he had bought less than halfanhour ago
he was interested in horses
forced by his calling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his fellowcitizens chief inspector heat relieved the instinct of credulity implanted in the human breast by putting unbounded faith in the sporting prophets of that particular evening publication
dropping the extra special on to the counter he plunged his hand again into his pocket and pulling out the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap of things that seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops he offered it to mrs verloc for inspection
i suppose you recognise this  she took it mechanically in both her hands
her eyes seemed to grow bigger as she looked
yes she whispered then raised her head and staggered backward a little
whatever for is it torn out like this  the chief inspector snatched across the counter the cloth out of her hands and she sat heavily on the chair
he thought identifications perfect
and in that moment he had a glimpse into the whole amazing truth
verloc was the other man  mrs verloc he said it strikes me that you know more of this bomb affair than even you yourself are aware of  mrs verloc sat still amazed lost in boundless astonishment
what was the connection
and she became so rigid all over that she was not able to turn her head at the clatter of the bell which caused the private investigator heat to spin round on his heel
mr verloc had shut the door and for a moment the two men looked at each other
mr verloc without looking at his wife walked up to the chief inspector who was relieved to see him return alone
you here muttered mr verloc heavily
who are you after  no one said chief inspector heat in a low tone
look here i would like a word or two with you  mr verloc still pale had brought an air of resolution with him
still he didnt look at his wife
he said  come in here then  and he led the way into the parlour
the door was hardly shut when mrs verloc jumping up from the chair ran to it as if to fling it open but instead of doing so fell on her knees with her ear to the keyhole
the two men must have stopped directly they were through because she heard plainly the chief inspectors voice though she could not see his finger pressed against her husbands breast emphatically
you are the other man verloc
two men were seen entering the park  and the voice of mr verloc said  well take me now
whats to prevent you
you have the right  oh no
i know too well who you have been giving yourself away to
hell have to manage this little affair all by himself
but dont you make a mistake its i who found you out  then she heard only muttering
inspector heat must have been showing to mr verloc the piece of stevies overcoat because stevies sister guardian and protector heard her husband a little louder
i never noticed that she had hit upon that dodge  again for a time mrs verloc heard nothing but murmurs whose mysteriousness was less nightmarish to her brain than the horrible suggestions of shaped words
then chief inspector heat on the other side of the door raised his voice
you must have been mad  and mr verlocs voice answered with a sort of gloomy fury  i have been mad for a month or more but i am not mad now
its all over
it shall all come out of my head and hang the consequences  there was a silence and then private citizen heat murmured  whats coming out  everything exclaimed the voice of mr verloc and then sank very low
after a while it rose again
you have known me for several years now and youve found me useful too
you know i was a straight man
yes straight  this appeal to old acquaintance must have been extremely distasteful to the chief inspector
his voice took on a warning note
dont you trust so much to what you have been promised
if i were you i would clear out
i dont think we will run after you  mr verloc was heard to laugh a little
oh yes you hope the others will get rid of me for youdont you
no no you dont shake me off now
i have been a straight man to those people too long and now everything must come out  let it come out then the indifferent voice of chief inspector heat assented
but tell me now how did you get away  i was making for chesterfield walk mrs verloc heard her husbands voice when i heard the bang
i started running then
fog
i saw no one till i was past the end of george street
dont think i met anyone till then  so easy as that marvelled the voice of chief inspector heat
the bang startled you eh  yes it came too soon confessed the gloomy husky voice of mr verloc
mrs verloc pressed her ear to the keyhole her lips were blue her hands cold as ice and her pale face in which the two eyes seemed like two black holes felt to her as if it were enveloped in flames
on the other side of the door the voices sank very low
she caught words now and then sometimes in her husbands voice sometimes in the smooth tones of the chief inspector
she heard this last say  we believe he stumbled against the root of a tree  there was a husky voluble murmur which lasted for some time and then the chief inspector as if answering some inquiry spoke emphatically
of course
blown to small bits limbs gravel clothing bones splintersall mixed up together
i tell you they had to fetch a shovel to gather him up with  mrs verloc sprang up suddenly from her crouching position and stopping her ears reeled to and fro between the counter and the shelves on the wall towards the chair
her crazed eyes noted the sporting sheet left by the chief inspector and as she knocked herself against the counter she snatched it up fell into the chair tore the optimistic rosy sheet right across in trying to open it then flung it on the floor
on the other side of the door chief inspector heat was saying to mr verloc the secret agent  so your defence will be practically a full confession  it will
i am going to tell the whole story  you wont be believed as much as you fancy you will  and the chief inspector remained thoughtful
the turn this affair was taking meant the disclosure of many thingsthe laying waste of fields of knowledge which cultivated by a capable man had a distinct value for the individual and for the society
it was sorry sorry meddling
it would leave michaelis unscathed it would drag to light the professors home industry disorganise the whole system of supervision make no end of a row in the papers which from that point of view appeared to him by a sudden illumination as invariably written by fools for the reading of imbeciles
mentally he agreed with the words mr verloc let fall at last in answer to his last remark
perhaps not
but it will upset many things
i have been a straight man and i shall keep straight in this  if they let you said the chief inspector cynically
you will be preached to no doubt before they put you into the dock
and in the end you may yet get let in for a sentence that will surprise you
i wouldnt trust too much the gentleman whos been talking to you  mr verloc listened frowning
my advice to you is to clear out while you may
i have no instructions
there are some of them continued chief inspector heat laying a peculiar stress on the word them who think you are already out of the world  indeed mr verloc was moved to say
though since his return from greenwich he had spent most of his time sitting in the taproom of an obscure little publichouse he could hardly have hoped for such favourable news
thats the impression about you  the chief inspector nodded at him
vanish
clear out  where to snarled mr verloc
he raised his head and gazing at the closed door of the parlour muttered feelingly i only wish you would take me away tonight
i would go quietly  i daresay assented sardonically the chief inspector following the direction of his glance
the brow of mr verloc broke into slight moisture
he lowered his husky voice confidentially before the unmoved chief inspector
the lad was halfwitted irresponsible
any court would have seen that at once
only fit for the asylum
and that was the worst that wouldve happened to him if  the chief inspector his hand on the door handle whispered into mr verlocs face
he mayve been halfwitted but you must have been crazy
what drove you off your head like this  mr verloc thinking of mr vladimir did not hesitate in the choice of words
a hyperborean swine he hissed forcibly
a what you might call aa gentleman  the chief inspector steadyeyed nodded briefly his comprehension and opened the door
mrs verloc behind the counter might have heard but did not see his departure pursued by the aggressive clatter of the bell
she sat at her post of duty behind the counter
she sat rigidly erect in the chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her feet
the palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face with the tips of the fingers contracted against the forehead as though the skin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently
the perfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and despair all the potential violence of tragic passions better than any shallow display of shrieks with the beating of a distracted head against the walls could have done
chief inspector heat crossing the shop at his busy swinging pace gave her only a cursory glance
and when the cracked bell ceased to tremble on its curved ribbon of steel nothing stirred near mrs verloc as if her attitude had the locking power of a spell
even the butterflyshaped gas flames posed on the ends of the suspended tbracket burned without a quiver
in that shop of shady wares fitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown which seemed to devour the sheen of the light the gold circlet of the wedding ring on mrs verlocs left hand glittered exceedingly with the untarnished glory of a piece from some splendid treasure of jewels dropped in a dustbin
chapter x   the assistant commissioner driven rapidly in a hansom from the neighbourhood of soho in the direction of westminster got out at the very centre of the empire on which the sun never sets
some stalwart constables who did not seem particularly impressed by the duty of watching the august spot saluted him
penetrating through a portal by no means lofty into the precincts of the house which is the house par excellence in the minds of many millions of men he was met at last by the volatile and revolutionary toodles
that neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the early appearance of the assistant commissioner whom he had been told to look out for some time about midnight
his turning up so early he concluded to be the sign that things whatever they were had gone wrong
with an extremely ready sympathy which in nice youngsters goes often with a joyous temperament he felt sorry for the great presence he called the chief and also for the assistant commissioner whose face appeared to him more ominously wooden than ever before and quite wonderfully long
what a queer foreignlooking chap he is he thought to himself smiling from a distance with friendly buoyancy
and directly they came together he began to talk with the kind intention of burying the awkwardness of failure under a heap of words
it looked as if the great assault threatened for that night were going to fizzle out
an inferior henchman of that brute cheeseman was up boring mercilessly a very thin house with some shamelessly cooked statistics
he toodles hoped he would bore them into a count out every minute
but then he might be only marking time to let that guzzling cheeseman dine at his leisure
anyway the chief could not be persuaded to go home
he will see you at once i think
hes sitting all alone in his room thinking of all the fishes of the sea concluded toodles airily
come along  notwithstanding the kindness of his disposition the young private secretary unpaid was accessible to the common failings of humanity
he did not wish to harrow the feelings of the assistant commissioner who looked to him uncommonly like a man who has made a mess of his job
but his curiosity was too strong to be restrained by mere compassion
he could not help as they went along to throw over his shoulder lightly  and your sprat  got him answered the assistant commissioner with a concision which did not mean to be repellent in the least
good
youve no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed in small things  after this profound observation the experienced toodles seemed to reflect
at any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds
then  im glad
buti sayis it really such a very small thing as you make it out  do you know what may be done with a sprat the assistant commissioner asked in his turn
hes sometimes put into a sardine box chuckled toodles whose erudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and in comparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters immense
there are sardine canneries on the spanish coast which  the assistant commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman
yes
yes
but a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order to catch a whale  a whale
phew exclaimed toodles with bated breath
youre after a whale then  not exactly
what i am after is more like a dogfish
you dont know perhaps what a dogfish is like  yes i do
were buried in special books up to our neckswhole shelves full of themwith plates    its a noxious rascallylooking altogether detestable beast with a sort of smooth face and moustaches  described to a t commended the assistant commissioner
only mine is cleanshaven altogether
youve seen him
its a witty fish  i have seen him said toodles incredulously
i cant conceive where i could have seen him  at the explorers i should say dropped the assistant commissioner calmly
at the name of that extremely exclusive club toodles looked scared and stopped short
nonsense he protested but in an awestruck tone
what do you mean
a member  honorary muttered the assistant commissioner through his teeth
heavens  toodles looked so thunderstruck that the assistant commissioner smiled faintly
thats between ourselves strictly he said
thats the beastliest thing ive ever heard in my life declared toodles feebly as if astonishment had robbed him of all his buoyant strength in a second
the assistant commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance
till they came to the door of the great mans room toodles preserved a scandalised and solemn silence as though he were offended with the assistant commissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and disturbing fact
it revolutionised his idea of the explorers clubs extreme selectness of its social purity
toodles was revolutionary only in politics his social beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve unchanged through all the years allotted to him on this earth which upon the whole he believed to be a nice place to live on
he stood aside
go in without knocking he said
shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted to the room something of a forests deep gloom
the haughty eyes were physically the great mans weak point
this point was wrapped up in secrecy
when an opportunity offered he rested them conscientiously
the assistant commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale hand supporting a big head and concealing the upper part of a big pale face
an open despatchbox stood on the writingtable near a few oblong sheets of paper and a scattered handful of quill pens
there was absolutely nothing else on the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette draped in a toga mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility
the assistant commissioner invited to take a chair sat down
in the dim light the salient points of his personality the long face the black hair his lankness made him look more foreign than ever
the great man manifested no surprise no eagerness no sentiment whatever
the attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was profoundly meditative
he did not alter it the least bit
but his tone was not dreamy
well
what is it that youve found out already
you came upon something unexpected on the first step  not exactly unexpected sir ethelred
what i mainly came upon was a psychological state  the great presence made a slight movement
you must be lucid please  yes sir ethelred
you know no doubt that most criminals at some time or other feel an irresistible need of confessingof making a clean breast of it to somebodyto anybody
and they do it often to the police
in that verloc whom heat wished so much to screen ive found a man in that particular psychological state
the man figuratively speaking flung himself on my breast
it was enough on my part to whisper to him who i was and to add i know that you are at the bottom of this affair  it must have seemed miraculous to him that we should know already but he took it all in the stride
the wonderfulness of it never checked him for a moment
there remained for me only to put to him the two questions who put you up to it
and who was the man who did it
he answered the first with remarkable emphasis
as to the second question i gather that the fellow with the bomb was his brotherinlawquite a lada weakminded creature   
it is rather a curious affairtoo long perhaps to state fully just now  what then have you learned asked the great man
first ive learned that the exconvict michaelis had nothing to do with it though indeed the lad had been living with him temporarily in the country up to eight oclock this morning
it is more than likely that michaelis knows nothing of it to this moment  you are positive as to that asked the great man
quite certain sir ethelred
this fellow verloc went there this morning and took away the lad on the pretence of going out for a walk in the lanes
as it was not the first time that he did this michaelis could not have the slightest suspicion of anything unusual
for the rest sir ethelred the indignation of this man verloc had left nothing in doubtnothing whatever
he had been driven out of his mind almost by an extraordinary performance which for you or me it would be difficult to take as seriously meant but which produced a great impression obviously on him  the assistant commissioner then imparted briefly to the great man who sat still resting his eyes under the screen of his hand mr verlocs appreciation of mr vladimirs proceedings and character
the assistant commissioner did not seem to refuse it a certain amount of competency
but the great personage remarked  all this seems very fantastic  doesnt it
one would think a ferocious joke
but our man took it seriously it appears
he felt himself threatened
in the time you know he was in direct communication with old stottwartenheim himself and had come to regard his services as indispensable
it was an extremely rude awakening
i imagine that he lost his head
he became angry and frightened
upon my word my impression is that he thought these embassy people quite capable not only to throw him out but to give him away too in some manner or other  how long were you with him interrupted the presence from behind his big hand
some forty minutes sir ethelred in a house of bad repute called continental hotel closeted in a room which bytheby i took for the night
i found him under the influence of that reaction which follows the effort of crime
the man cannot be defined as a hardened criminal
it is obvious that he did not plan the death of that wretched ladhis brotherinlaw
that was a shock to himi could see that
perhaps he is a man of strong sensibilities
perhaps he was even fond of the ladwho knows
he might have hoped that the fellow would get clear away in which case it would have been almost impossible to bring this thing home to anyone
at any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him  the assistant commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect for a moment
though how in that last case he could hope to have his own share in the business concealed is more than i can tell he continued in his ignorance of poor stevies devotion to mr verloc who was good and of his truly peculiar dumbness which in the old affair of fireworks on the stairs had for many years resisted entreaties coaxing anger and other means of investigation used by his beloved sister
for stevie was loyal     no i cant imagine
its possible that he never thought of that at all
it sounds an extravagant way of putting it sir ethelred but his state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who after committing suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles had discovered that it did nothing of the kind  the assistant commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic voice
but in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant language and the great man was not offended
a slight jerky movement of the big body half lost in the gloom of the green silk shades of the big head leaning on the big hand accompanied an intermittent stifled but powerful sound
the great man had laughed
what have you done with him  the assistant commissioner answered very readily  as he seemed very anxious to get back to his wife in the shop i let him go sir ethelred  you did
but the fellow will disappear  pardon me
i dont think so
where could he go to
moreover you must remember that he has got to think of the danger from his comrades too
hes there at his post
how could he explain leaving it
but even if there were no obstacles to his freedom of action he would do nothing
at present he hasnt enough moral energy to take a resolution of any sort
permit me also to point out that if i had detained him we would have been committed to a course of action on which i wished to know your precise intentions first  the great personage rose heavily an imposing shadowy form in the greenish gloom of the room
ill see the attorneygeneral tonight and will send for you tomorrow morning
is there anything more youd wish to tell me now  the assistant commissioner had stood up also slender and flexible
i think not sir ethelred unless i were to enter into details which  no
no details please  the great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical dread of details then came forward expanded enormous and weighty offering a large hand
and you say that this man has got a wife  yes sir ethelred said the assistant commissioner pressing deferentially the extended hand
a genuine wife and a genuinely respectably marital relation
he told me that after his interview at the embassy he would have thrown everything up would have tried to sell his shop and leave the country only he felt certain that his wife would not even hear of going abroad
nothing could be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that went on with a touch of grimness the assistant commissioner whose own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad
yes a genuine wife
and the victim was a genuine brotherinlaw
from a certain point of view we are here in the presence of a domestic drama  the assistant commissioner laughed a little but the great mans thoughts seemed to have wandered far away perhaps to the questions of his countrys domestic policy the battleground of his crusading valour against the paynim cheeseman
the assistant commissioner withdrew quietly unnoticed as if already forgotten
he had his own crusading instincts
this affair which in one way or another disgusted chief inspector heat seemed to him a providentially given startingpoint for a crusade
he had it much at heart to begin
he walked slowly home meditating that enterprise on the way and thinking over mr verlocs psychology in a composite mood of repugnance and satisfaction
he walked all the way home
finding the drawingroom dark he went upstairs and spent some time between the bedroom and the dressingroom changing his clothes going to and fro with the air of a thoughtful somnambulist
but he shook it off before going out again to join his wife at the house of the great lady patroness of michaelis
he knew he would be welcomed there
on entering the smaller of the two drawingrooms he saw his wife in a small group near the piano
a youngish composer in pass of becoming famous was discoursing from a music stool to two thick men whose backs looked old and three slender women whose backs looked young
behind the screen the great lady had only two persons with her a man and a woman who sat side by side on armchairs at the foot of her couch
she extended her hand to the assistant commissioner
i never hoped to see you here tonight
annie told me  yes
i had no idea myself that my work would be over so soon  the assistant commissioner added in a low tone i am glad to tell you that michaelis is altogether clear of this  the patroness of the exconvict received this assurance indignantly
why
were your people stupid enough to connect him with  not stupid interrupted the assistant commissioner contradicting deferentially
clever enoughquite clever enough for that  a silence fell
the man at the foot of the couch had stopped speaking to the lady and looked on with a faint smile
i dont know whether you ever met before said the great lady
mr vladimir and the assistant commissioner introduced acknowledged each others existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy
hes been frightening me declared suddenly the lady who sat by the side of mr vladimir with an inclination of the head towards that gentleman
the assistant commissioner knew the lady
you do not look frightened he pronounced after surveying her conscientiously with his tired and equable gaze
he was thinking meantime to himself that in this house one met everybody sooner or later
mr vladimirs rosy countenance was wreathed in smiles because he was witty but his eyes remained serious like the eyes of convinced man
well he tried to at least amended the lady
force of habit perhaps said the assistant commissioner moved by an irresistible inspiration
he has been threatening society with all sorts of horrors continued the lady whose enunciation was caressing and slow apropos of this explosion in greenwich park
it appears we all ought to quake in our shoes at whats coming if those people are not suppressed all over the world
i had no idea this was such a grave affair  mr vladimir affecting not to listen leaned towards the couch talking amiably in subdued tones but he heard the assistant commissioner say  ive no doubt that mr vladimir has a very precise notion of the true importance of this affair  mr vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive policeman was driving at
descended from generations victimised by the instruments of an arbitrary power he was racially nationally and individually afraid of the police
it was an inherited weakness altogether independent of his judgment of his reason of his experience
he was born to it
but that sentiment which resembled the irrational horror some people have of cats did not stand in the way of his immense contempt for the english police
he finished the sentence addressed to the great lady and turned slightly in his chair
you mean that we have a great experience of these people
yes indeed we suffer greatly from their activity while youmr vladimir hesitated for a moment in smiling perplexitywhile you suffer their presence gladly in your midst he finished displaying a dimple on each cleanshaven cheek
then he added more gravely i may even saybecause you do  when mr vladimir ceased speaking the assistant commissioner lowered his glance and the conversation dropped
almost immediately afterwards mr vladimir took leave
directly his back was turned on the couch the assistant commissioner rose too
i thought you were going to stay and take annie home said the lady patroness of michaelis
i find that ive yet a little work to do tonight  in connection  well yesin a way  tell me what is it reallythis horror  its difficult to say what it is but it may yet be a cause clbre said the assistant commissioner
he left the drawingroom hurriedly and found mr vladimir still in the hall wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief
behind him a footman waited holding his overcoat
another stood ready to open the door
the assistant commissioner was duly helped into his coat and let out at once
after descending the front steps he stopped as if to consider the way he should take
on seeing this through the door held open mr vladimir lingered in the hall to get out a cigar and asked for a light
it was furnished to him by an elderly man out of livery with an air of calm solicitude
but the match went out the footman then closed the door and mr vladimir lighted his large havana with leisurely care
when at last he got out of the house he saw with disgust the confounded policeman still standing on the pavement
can he be waiting for me thought mr vladimir looking up and down for some signs of a hansom
he saw none
a couple of carriages waited by the curbstone their lamps blazing steadily the horses standing perfectly still as if carved in stone the coachmen sitting motionless under the big fur capes without as much as a quiver stirring the white thongs of their big whips
mr vladimir walked on and the confounded policeman fell into step at his elbow
he said nothing
at the end of the fourth stride mr vladimir felt infuriated and uneasy
this could not last
rotten weather he growled savagely
mild said the assistant commissioner without passion
he remained silent for a little while
weve got hold of a man called verloc he announced casually
mr vladimir did not stumble did not stagger back did not change his stride
but he could not prevent himself from exclaiming what  the assistant commissioner did not repeat his statement
you know him he went on in the same tone
mr vladimir stopped and became guttural
what makes you say that  i dont
its verloc who says that  a lying dog of some sort said mr vladimir in somewhat oriental phraseology
but in his heart he was almost awed by the miraculous cleverness of the english police
the change of his opinion on the subject was so violent that it made him for a moment feel slightly sick
he threw away his cigar and moved on
what pleased me most in this affair the assistant went on talking slowly is that it makes such an excellent startingpoint for a piece of work which ive felt must be taken in handthat is the clearing out of this country of all the foreign political spies police and that sort ofofdogs
in my opinion they are a ghastly nuisance also an element of danger
but we cant very well seek them out individually
the only way is to make their employment unpleasant to their employers
the things becoming indecent
and dangerous too for us here  mr vladimir stopped again for a moment
what do you mean  the prosecution of this verloc will demonstrate to the public both the danger and the indecency  nobody will believe what a man of that sort says said mr vladimir contemptuously
the wealth and precision of detail will carry conviction to the great mass of the public advanced the assistant commissioner gently
so that is seriously what you mean to do  weve got the man we have no choice  you will be only feeding up the lying spirit of these revolutionary scoundrels mr vladimir protested
what do you want to make a scandal forfrom moralityor what  mr vladimirs anxiety was obvious
the assistant commissioner having ascertained in this way that there must be some truth in the summary statements of mr verloc said indifferently  theres a practical side too
we have really enough to do to look after the genuine article
you cant say we are not effective
but we dont intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext whatever  mr vladimirs tone became lofty
for my part i cant share your view
it is selfish
my sentiments for my own country cannot be doubted but ive always felt that we ought to be good europeans besidesi mean governments and men  yes said the assistant commissioner simply
only you look at europe from its other end
but he went on in a goodnatured tone the foreign governments cannot complain of the inefficiency of our police
look at this outrage a case specially difficult to trace inasmuch as it was a sham
in less than twelve hours we have established the identity of a man literally blown to shreds have found the organiser of the attempt and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him
and we could have gone further only we stopped at the limits of our territory  so this instructive crime was planned abroad mr vladimir said quickly
you admit it was planned abroad  theoretically
theoretically only on foreign territory abroad only by a fiction said the assistant commissioner alluding to the character of embassies which are supposed to be part and parcel of the country to which they belong
but thats a detail
i talked to you of this business because its your government that grumbles most at our police
you see that we are not so bad
i wanted particularly to tell you of our success  im sure im very grateful muttered mr vladimir through his teeth
we can put our finger on every anarchist here went on the assistant commissioner as though he were quoting chief inspector heat
all thats wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur to make everything safe  mr vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom
youre not going in here remarked the assistant commissioner looking at a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect with the light of a great hall falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of steps
but mr vladimir sitting stonyeyed inside the hansom drove off without a word
the assistant commissioner himself did not turn into the noble building
it was the explorers club
the thought passed through his mind that mr vladimir honorary member would not be seen very often there in the future
he looked at his watch
it was only halfpast ten
he had had a very full evening
chapter xi   after chief inspector heat had left him mr verloc moved about the parlour
from time to time he eyed his wife through the open door
she knows all about it now he thought to himself with commiseration for her sorrow and with some satisfaction as regarded himself
mr verlocs soul if lacking greatness perhaps was capable of tender sentiments
the prospect of having to break the news to her had put him into a fever
chief inspector heat had relieved him of the task
that was good as far as it went
it remained for him now to face her grief
mr verloc had never expected to have to face it on account of death whose catastrophic character cannot be argued away by sophisticated reasoning or persuasive eloquence
mr verloc never meant stevie to perish with such abrupt violence
he did not mean him to perish at all
stevie dead was a much greater nuisance than ever he had been when alive
mr verloc had augured a favourable issue to his enterprise basing himself not on stevies intelligence which sometimes plays queer tricks with a man but on the blind docility and on the blind devotion of the boy
though not much of a psychologist mr verloc had gauged the depth of stevies fanaticism
he dared cherish the hope of stevie walking away from the walls of the observatory as he had been instructed to do taking the way shown to him several times previously and rejoining his brotherinlaw the wise and good mr verloc outside the precincts of the park
fifteen minutes ought to have been enough for the veriest fool to deposit the engine and walk away
and the professor had guaranteed more than fifteen minutes
but stevie had stumbled within five minutes of being left to himself
and mr verloc was shaken morally to pieces
he had foreseen everything but that
he had foreseen stevie distracted and lostsought forfound in some police station or provincial workhouse in the end
he had foreseen stevie arrested and was not afraid because mr verloc had a great opinion of stevies loyalty which had been carefully indoctrinated with the necessity of silence in the course of many walks
like a peripatetic philosopher mr verloc strolling along the streets of london had modified stevies view of the police by conversations full of subtle reasonings
never had a sage a more attentive and admiring disciple
the submission and worship were so apparent that mr verloc had come to feel something like a liking for the boy
in any case he had not foreseen the swift bringing home of his connection
that his wife should hit upon the precaution of sewing the boys address inside his overcoat was the last thing mr verloc would have thought of
one cant think of everything
that was what she meant when she said that he need not worry if he lost stevie during their walks
she had assured him that the boy would turn up all right
well he had turned up with a vengeance
well well muttered mr verloc in his wonder
what did she mean by it
spare him the trouble of keeping an anxious eye on stevie
most likely she had meant well
only she ought to have told him of the precaution she had taken
mr verloc walked behind the counter of the shop
his intention was not to overwhelm his wife with bitter reproaches
mr verloc felt no bitterness
the unexpected march of events had converted him to the doctrine of fatalism
nothing could be helped now
he said  i didnt mean any harm to come to the boy  mrs verloc shuddered at the sound of her husbands voice
she did not uncover her face
the trusted secret agent of the late baron stottwartenheim looked at her for a time with a heavy persistent undiscerning glance
the torn evening paper was lying at her feet
it could not have told her much
mr verloc felt the need of talking to his wife
its that damned heateh he said
he upset you
hes a brute blurting it out like this to a woman
i made myself ill thinking how to break it to you
i sat for hours in the little parlour of cheshire cheese thinking over the best way
you understand i never meant any harm to come to that boy  mr verloc the secret agent was speaking the truth
it was his marital affection that had received the greatest shock from the premature explosion
he added  i didnt feel particularly gay sitting there and thinking of you  he observed another slight shudder of his wife which affected his sensibility
as she persisted in hiding her face in her hands he thought he had better leave her alone for a while
on this delicate impulse mr verloc withdrew into the parlour again where the gas jet purred like a contented cat
mrs verlocs wifely forethought had left the cold beef on the table with carving knife and fork and half a loaf of bread for mr verlocs supper
he noticed all these things now for the first time and cutting himself a piece of bread and meat began to eat
his appetite did not proceed from callousness
mr verloc had not eaten any breakfast that day
he had left his home fasting
not being an energetic man he found his resolution in nervous excitement which seemed to hold him mainly by the throat
he could not have swallowed anything solid
michaelis cottage was as destitute of provisions as the cell of a prisoner
the ticketofleave apostle lived on a little milk and crusts of stale bread
moreover when mr verloc arrived he had already gone upstairs after his frugal meal
absorbed in the toil and delight of literary composition he had not even answered mr verlocs shout up the little staircase
i am taking this young fellow home for a day or two  and in truth mr verloc did not wait for an answer but had marched out of the cottage at once followed by the obedient stevie
now that all action was over and his fate taken out of his hands with unexpected swiftness mr verloc felt terribly empty physically
he carved the meat cut the bread and devoured his supper standing by the table and now and then casting a glance towards his wife
her prolonged immobility disturbed the comfort of his refection
he walked again into the shop and came up very close to her
this sorrow with a veiled face made mr verloc uneasy
he expected of course his wife to be very much upset but he wanted her to pull herself together
he needed all her assistance and all her loyalty in these new conjunctures his fatalism had already accepted
cant be helped he said in a tone of gloomy sympathy
come winnie weve got to think of tomorrow
youll want all your wits about you after i am taken away  he paused
mrs verlocs breast heaved convulsively
this was not reassuring to mr verloc in whose view the newly created situation required from the two people most concerned in it calmness decision and other qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate sorrow
mr verloc was a humane man he had come home prepared to allow every latitude to his wifes affection for her brother
only he did not understand either the nature or the whole extent of that sentiment
and in this he was excusable since it was impossible for him to understand it without ceasing to be himself
he was startled and disappointed and his speech conveyed it by a certain roughness of tone
you might look at a fellow he observed after waiting a while
as if forced through the hands covering mrs verlocs face the answer came deadened almost pitiful
i dont want to look at you as long as i live  eh
what  mr verloc was merely startled by the superficial and literal meaning of this declaration
it was obviously unreasonable the mere cry of exaggerated grief
he threw over it the mantle of his marital indulgence
the mind of mr verloc lacked profundity
under the mistaken impression that the value of individuals consists in what they are in themselves he could not possibly comprehend the value of stevie in the eyes of mrs verloc
she was taking it confoundedly hard he thought to himself
it was all the fault of that damned heat
what did he want to upset the woman for
but she mustnt be allowed for her own good to carry on so till she got quite beside herself
look here
you cant sit like this in the shop he said with affected severity in which there was some real annoyance for urgent practical matters must be talked over if they had to sit up all night
somebody might come in at any minute he added and waited again
no effect was produced and the idea of the finality of death occurred to mr verloc during the pause
he changed his tone
come
this wont bring him back he said gently feeling ready to take her in his arms and press her to his breast where impatience and compassion dwelt side by side
but except for a short shudder mrs verloc remained apparently unaffected by the force of that terrible truism
it was mr verloc himself who was moved
he was moved in his simplicity to urge moderation by asserting the claims of his own personality
do be reasonable winnie
what would it have been if you had lost me  he had vaguely expected to hear her cry out
but she did not budge
she leaned back a little quieted down to a complete unreadable stillness
mr verlocs heart began to beat faster with exasperation and something resembling alarm
he laid his hand on her shoulder saying  dont be a fool winnie  she gave no sign
it was impossible to talk to any purpose with a woman whose face one cannot see
mr verloc caught hold of his wifes wrists
but her hands seemed glued fast
she swayed forward bodily to his tug and nearly went off the chair
startled to feel her so helplessly limp he was trying to put her back on the chair when she stiffened suddenly all over tore herself out of his hands ran out of the shop across the parlour and into the kitchen
this was very swift
he had just a glimpse of her face and that much of her eyes that he knew she had not looked at him
it all had the appearance of a struggle for the possession of a chair because mr verloc instantly took his wifes place in it
mr verloc did not cover his face with his hands but a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his features
a term of imprisonment could not be avoided
he did not wish now to avoid it
a prison was a place as safe from certain unlawful vengeances as the grave with this advantage that in a prison there is room for hope
what he saw before him was a term of imprisonment an early release and then life abroad somewhere such as he had contemplated already in case of failure
well it was a failure if not exactly the sort of failure he had feared
it had been so near success that he could have positively terrified mr vladimir out of his ferocious scoffing with this proof of occult efficiency
so at least it seemed now to mr verloc
his prestige with the embassy would have been immense ifif his wife had not had the unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside stevies overcoat
mr verloc who was no fool had soon perceived the extraordinary character of the influence he had over stevie though he did not understand exactly its originthe doctrine of his supreme wisdom and goodness inculcated by two anxious women
in all the eventualities he had foreseen mr verloc had calculated with correct insight on stevies instinctive loyalty and blind discretion
the eventuality he had not foreseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond husband
from every other point of view it was rather advantageous
nothing can equal the everlasting discretion of death
mr verloc sitting perplexed and frightened in the small parlour of the cheshire cheese could not help acknowledging that to himself because his sensibility did not stand in the way of his judgment
stevies violent disintegration however disturbing to think about only assured the success for of course the knocking down of a wall was not the aim of mr vladimirs menaces but the production of a moral effect
with much trouble and distress on mr verlocs part the effect might be said to have been produced
when however most unexpectedly it came home to roost in brett street mr verloc who had been struggling like a man in a nightmare for the preservation of his position accepted the blow in the spirit of a convinced fatalist
the position was gone through no ones fault really
a small tiny fact had done it
it was like slipping on a bit of orange peel in the dark and breaking your leg
mr verloc drew a weary breath
he nourished no resentment against his wife
he thought she will have to look after the shop while they keep me locked up
and thinking also how cruelly she would miss stevie at first he felt greatly concerned about her health and spirits
how would she stand her solitudeabsolutely alone in that house
it would not do for her to break down while he was locked up
what would become of the shop then
the shop was an asset
though mr verlocs fatalism accepted his undoing as a secret agent he had no mind to be utterly ruined mostly it must be owned from regard for his wife
silent and out of his line of sight in the kitchen she frightened him
if only she had had her mother with her
but that silly old womanan angry dismay possessed mr verloc
he must talk with his wife
he could tell her certainly that a man does get desperate under certain circumstances
but he did not go incontinently to impart to her that information
first of all it was clear to him that this evening was no time for business
he got up to close the street door and put the gas out in the shop
having thus assured a solitude around his hearthstone mr verloc walked into the parlour and glanced down into the kitchen
mrs verloc was sitting in the place where poor stevie usually established himself of an evening with paper and pencil for the pastime of drawing these coruscations of innumerable circles suggesting chaos and eternity
her arms were folded on the table and her head was lying on her arms
mr verloc contemplated her back and the arrangement of her hair for a time then walked away from the kitchen door
mrs verlocs philosophical almost disdainful incuriosity the foundation of their accord in domestic life made it extremely difficult to get into contact with her now this tragic necessity had arisen
mr verloc felt this difficulty acutely
he turned around the table in the parlour with his usual air of a large animal in a cage
curiosity being one of the forms of selfrevelation a systematically incurious person remains always partly mysterious
every time he passed near the door mr verloc glanced at his wife uneasily
it was not that he was afraid of her
mr verloc imagined himself loved by that woman
but she had not accustomed him to make confidences
and the confidence he had to make was of a profound psychological order
how with his want of practice could he tell her what he himself felt but vaguely that there are conspiracies of fatal destiny that a notion grows in a mind sometimes till it acquires an outward existence an independent power of its own and even a suggestive voice
he could not inform her that a man may be haunted by a fat witty cleanshaved face till the wildest expedient to get rid of it appears a child of wisdom
on this mental reference to a first secretary of a great embassy mr verloc stopped in the doorway and looking down into the kitchen with an angry face and clenched fists addressed his wife
you dont know what a brute i had to deal with  he started off to make another perambulation of the table then when he had come to the door again he stopped glaring in from the height of two steps
a silly jeering dangerous brute with no more sense thanafter all these years
a man like me
and i have been playing my head at that game
you didnt know
quite right too
what was the good of telling you that i stood the risk of having a knife stuck into me any time these seven years weve been married
i am not a chap to worry a woman thats fond of me
you had no business to know  mr verloc took another turn round the parlour fuming
a venomous beast he began again from the doorway
drive me out into a ditch to starve for a joke
i could see he thought it was a damned good joke
a man like me
look here
some of the highest in the world got to thank me for walking on their two legs to this day
thats the man youve got married to my girl  he perceived that his wife had sat up
mrs verlocs arms remained lying stretched on the table
mr verloc watched at her back as if he could read there the effect of his words
there isnt a murdering plot for the last eleven years that i hadnt my finger in at the risk of my life
theres scores of these revolutionists ive sent off with their bombs in their blamed pockets to get themselves caught on the frontier
the old baron knew what i was worth to his country
and here suddenly a swine comes alongan ignorant overbearing swine  mr verloc stepping slowly down two steps entered the kitchen took a tumbler off the dresser and holding it in his hand approached the sink without looking at his wife
it wasnt the old baron who would have had the wicked folly of getting me to call on him at eleven in the morning
there are two or three in this town that if they had seen me going in would have made no bones about knocking me on the head sooner or later
it was a silly murderous trick to expose for nothing a manlike me  mr verloc turning on the tap above the sink poured three glasses of water one after another down his throat to quench the fires of his indignation
mr vladimirs conduct was like a hot brand which set his internal economy in a blaze
he could not get over the disloyalty of it
this man who would not work at the usual hard tasks which society sets to its humbler members had exercised his secret industry with an indefatigable devotion
there was in mr verloc a fund of loyalty
he had been loyal to his employers to the cause of social stabilityand to his affections tooas became apparent when after standing the tumbler in the sink he turned about saying  if i hadnt thought of you i would have taken the bullying brute by the throat and rammed his head into the fireplace
id have been more than a match for that pinkfaced smoothshaved  mr verloc neglected to finish the sentence as if there could be no doubt of the terminal word
for the first time in his life he was taking that incurious woman into his confidence
the singularity of the event the force and importance of the personal feelings aroused in the course of this confession drove stevies fate clean out of mr verlocs mind
the boys stuttering existence of fears and indignations together with the violence of his end had passed out of mr verlocs mental sight for a time
for that reason when he looked up he was startled by the inappropriate character of his wifes stare
it was not a wild stare and it was not inattentive but its attention was peculiar and not satisfactory inasmuch that it seemed concentrated upon some point beyond mr verlocs person
the impression was so strong that mr verloc glanced over his shoulder
there was nothing behind him there was just the whitewashed wall
the excellent husband of winnie verloc saw no writing on the wall
he turned to his wife again repeating with some emphasis  i would have taken him by the throat
as true as i stand here if i hadnt thought of you then i would have half choked the life out of the brute before i let him get up
and dont you think he would have been anxious to call the police either
he wouldnt have dared
you understand whydont you  he blinked at his wife knowingly
no said mrs verloc in an unresonant voice and without looking at him at all
what are you talking about  a great discouragement the result of fatigue came upon mr verloc
he had had a very full day and his nerves had been tried to the utmost
after a month of maddening worry ending in an unexpected catastrophe the stormtossed spirit of mr verloc longed for repose
his career as a secret agent had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen only now perhaps he could manage to get a nights sleep at last
but looking at his wife he doubted it
she was taking it very hardnot at all like herself he thought
he made an effort to speak
youll have to pull yourself together my girl he said sympathetically
whats done cant be undone  mrs verloc gave a slight start though not a muscle of her white face moved in the least
mr verloc who was not looking at her continued ponderously
you go to bed now
what you want is a good cry  this opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general consent of mankind
it is universally understood that as if it were nothing more substantial than vapour floating in the sky every emotion of a woman is bound to end in a shower
and it is very probable that had stevie died in his bed under her despairing gaze in her protecting arms mrs verlocs grief would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure tears
mrs verloc in common with other human beings was provided with a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal manifestation of human destiny
without troubling her head about it she was aware that it did not stand looking into very much  but the lamentable circumstances of stevies end which to mr verlocs mind had only an episodic character as part of a greater disaster dried her tears at their very source
it was the effect of a whitehot iron drawn across her eyes at the same time her heart hardened and chilled into a lump of ice kept her body in an inward shudder set her features into a frozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall with no writing on it
the exigencies of mrs verlocs temperament which when stripped of its philosophical reserve was maternal and violent forced her to roll a series of thoughts in her motionless head
these thoughts were rather imagined than expressed
mrs verloc was a woman of singularly few words either for public or private use
with the rage and dismay of a betrayed woman she reviewed the tenor of her life in visions concerned mostly with stevies difficult existence from its earliest days
it was a life of single purpose and of a noble unity of inspiration like those rare lives that have left their mark on the thoughts and feelings of mankind
but the visions of mrs verloc lacked nobility and magnificence
she saw herself putting the boy to bed by the light of a single candle on the deserted top floor of a business house dark under the roof and scintillating exceedingly with lights and cut glass at the level of the street like a fairy palace
that meretricious splendour was the only one to be met in mrs verlocs visions
she remembered brushing the boys hair and tying his pinaforesherself in a pinafore still the consolations administered to a small and badly scared creature by another creature nearly as small but not quite so badly scared she had the vision of the blows intercepted often with her own head of a door held desperately shut against a mans rage not for very long of a poker flung once not very far which stilled that particular storm into the dumb and awful silence which follows a thunderclap
and all these scenes of violence came and went accompanied by the unrefined noise of deep vociferations proceeding from a man wounded in his paternal pride declaring himself obviously accursed since one of his kids was a slobbering idjut and the other a wicked shedevil  it was of her that this had been said many years ago
mrs verloc heard the words again in a ghostly fashion and then the dreary shadow of the belgravian mansion descended upon her shoulders
it was a crushing memory an exhausting vision of countless breakfast trays carried up and down innumerable stairs of endless haggling over pence of the endless drudgery of sweeping dusting cleaning from basement to attics while the impotent mother staggering on swollen legs cooked in a grimy kitchen and poor stevie the unconscious presiding genius of all their toil blacked the gentlemens boots in the scullery
but this vision had a breath of a hot london summer in it and for a central figure a young man wearing his sunday best with a straw hat on his dark head and a wooden pipe in his mouth
affectionate and jolly he was a fascinating companion for a voyage down the sparkling stream of life only his boat was very small
there was room in it for a girlpartner at the oar but no accommodation for passengers
he was allowed to drift away from the threshold of the belgravian mansion while winnie averted her tearful eyes
he was not a lodger
the lodger was mr verloc indolent and keeping late hours sleepily jocular of a morning from under his bedclothes but with gleams of infatuation in his heavy lidded eyes and always with some money in his pockets
there was no sparkle of any kind on the lazy stream of his life
it flowed through secret places
but his barque seemed a roomy craft and his taciturn magnanimity accepted as a matter of course the presence of passengers
mrs verloc pursued the visions of seven years security for stevie loyally paid for on her part of security growing into confidence into a domestic feeling stagnant and deep like a placid pool whose guarded surface hardly shuddered on the occasional passage of comrade ossipon the robust anarchist with shamelessly inviting eyes whose glance had a corrupt clearness sufficient to enlighten any woman not absolutely imbecile
a few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered aloud in the kitchen and mrs verloc was staring already at the vision of an episode not more than a fortnight old
with eyes whose pupils were extremely dilated she stared at the vision of her husband and poor stevie walking up brett street side by side away from the shop
it was the last scene of an existence created by mrs verlocs genius an existence foreign to all grace and charm without beauty and almost without decency but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity of purpose
and this last vision had such plastic relief such nearness of form such a fidelity of suggestive detail that it wrung from mrs verloc an anguished and faint murmur reproducing the supreme illusion of her life an appalled murmur that died out on her blanched lips
might have been father and son  mr verloc stopped and raised a careworn face
eh
what did you say he asked
receiving no reply he resumed his sinister tramping
then with a menacing flourish of a thick fleshy fist he burst out  yes
the embassy people
a pretty lot aint they
before a weeks out ill make some of them wish themselves twenty feet underground
eh
what  he glanced sideways with his head down
mrs verloc gazed at the whitewashed wall
a blank wallperfectly blank
a blankness to run at and dash your head against
mrs verloc remained immovably seated
she kept still as the population of half the globe would keep still in astonishment and despair were the sun suddenly put out in the summer sky by the perfidy of a trusted providence
the embassy mr verloc began again after a preliminary grimace which bared his teeth wolfishly
i wish i could get loose in there with a cudgel for halfanhour
i would keep on hitting till there wasnt a single unbroken bone left amongst the whole lot
but never mind ill teach them yet what it means trying to throw out a man like me to rot in the streets
ive a tongue in my head
all the world shall know what ive done for them
i am not afraid
i dont care
everythingll come out
every damned thing
let them look out  in these terms did mr verloc declare his thirst for revenge
it was a very appropriate revenge
it was in harmony with the promptings of mr verlocs genius
it had also the advantage of being within the range of his powers and of adjusting itself easily to the practice of his life which had consisted precisely in betraying the secret and unlawful proceedings of his fellowmen
anarchists or diplomats were all one to him
mr verloc was temperamentally no respecter of persons
his scorn was equally distributed over the whole field of his operations
but as a member of a revolutionary proletariatwhich he undoubtedly washe nourished a rather inimical sentiment against social distinction
nothing on earth can stop me now he added and paused looking fixedly at his wife who was looking fixedly at a blank wall
the silence in the kitchen was prolonged and mr verloc felt disappointed
he had expected his wife to say something
but mrs verlocs lips composed in their usual form preserved a statuesque immobility like the rest of her face
and mr verloc was disappointed
yet the occasion did not he recognised demand speech from her
she was a woman of very few words
for reasons involved in the very foundation of his psychology mr verloc was inclined to put his trust in any woman who had given herself to him
therefore he trusted his wife
their accord was perfect but it was not precise
it was a tacit accord congenial to mrs verlocs incuriosity and to mr verlocs habits of mind which were indolent and secret
they refrained from going to the bottom of facts and motives
this reserve expressing in a way their profound confidence in each other introduced at the same time a certain element of vagueness into their intimacy
no system of conjugal relations is perfect
mr verloc presumed that his wife had understood him but he would have been glad to hear her say what she thought at the moment
it would have been a comfort
there were several reasons why this comfort was denied him
there was a physical obstacle mrs verloc had no sufficient command over her voice
she did not see any alternative between screaming and silence and instinctively she chose the silence
winnie verloc was temperamentally a silent person
and there was the paralysing atrocity of the thought which occupied her
her cheeks were blanched her lips ashy her immobility amazing
and she thought without looking at mr verloc this man took the boy away to murder him
he took the boy away from his home to murder him
he took the boy away from me to murder him  mrs verlocs whole being was racked by that inconclusive and maddening thought
it was in her veins in her bones in the roots of her hair
mentally she assumed the biblical attitude of mourningthe covered face the rent garments the sound of wailing and lamentation filled her head
but her teeth were violently clenched and her tearless eyes were hot with rage because she was not a submissive creature
the protection she had extended over her brother had been in its origin of a fierce and indignant complexion
she had to love him with a militant love
she had battled for himeven against herself
his loss had the bitterness of defeat with the anguish of a baffled passion
it was not an ordinary stroke of death
moreover it was not death that took stevie from her
it was mr verloc who took him away
she had seen him
she had watched him without raising a hand take the boy away
and she had let him go likelike a foola blind fool
then after he had murdered the boy he came home to her
just came home like any other man would come home to his wife   
through her set teeth mrs verloc muttered at the wall  and i thought he had caught a cold  mr verloc heard these words and appropriated them
it was nothing he said moodily
i was upset
i was upset on your account  mrs verloc turning her head slowly transferred her stare from the wall to her husbands person
mr verloc with the tips of his fingers between his lips was looking on the ground
cant be helped he mumbled letting his hand fall
you must pull yourself together
youll want all your wits about you
it is you who brought the police about our ears
never mind i wont say anything more about it continued mr verloc magnanimously
you couldnt know  i couldnt breathed out mrs verloc
it was as if a corpse had spoken
mr verloc took up the thread of his discourse
i dont blame you
ill make them sit up
once under lock and key it will be safe enough for me to talkyou understand
you must reckon on me being two years away from you he continued in a tone of sincere concern
it will be easier for you than for me
youll have something to do while ilook here winnie what you must do is to keep this business going for two years
you know enough for that
youve a good head on you
ill send you word when its time to go about trying to sell
youll have to be extra careful
the comrades will be keeping an eye on you all the time
youll have to be as artful as you know how and as close as the grave
no one must know what you are going to do
i have no mind to get a knock on the head or a stab in the back directly i am let out  thus spoke mr verloc applying his mind with ingenuity and forethought to the problems of the future
his voice was sombre because he had a correct sentiment of the situation
everything which he did not wish to pass had come to pass
the future had become precarious
his judgment perhaps had been momentarily obscured by his dread of mr vladimirs truculent folly
a man somewhat over forty may be excusably thrown into considerable disorder by the prospect of losing his employment especially if the man is a secret agent of political police dwelling secure in the consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high personages
he was excusable
now the thing had ended in a crash
mr verloc was cool but he was not cheerful
a secret agent who throws his secrecy to the winds from desire of vengeance and flaunts his achievements before the public eye becomes the mark for desperate and bloodthirsty indignations
without unduly exaggerating the danger mr verloc tried to bring it clearly before his wifes mind
he repeated that he had no intention to let the revolutionists do away with him
he looked straight into his wifes eyes
the enlarged pupils of the woman received his stare into their unfathomable depths
i am too fond of you for that he said with a little nervous laugh
a faint flush coloured mrs verlocs ghastly and motionless face
having done with the visions of the past she had not only heard but had also understood the words uttered by her husband
by their extreme disaccord with her mental condition these words produced on her a slightly suffocating effect
mrs verlocs mental condition had the merit of simplicity but it was not sound
it was governed too much by a fixed idea
every nook and cranny of her brain was filled with the thought that this man with whom she had lived without distaste for seven years had taken the poor boy away from her in order to kill himthe man to whom she had grown accustomed in body and mind the man whom she had trusted took the boy away to kill him
in its form in its substance in its effect which was universal altering even the aspect of inanimate things it was a thought to sit still and marvel at for ever and ever
mrs verloc sat still
and across that thought not across the kitchen the form of mr verloc went to and fro familiarly in hat and overcoat stamping with his boots upon her brain
he was probably talking too but mrs verlocs thought for the most part covered the voice
now and then however the voice would make itself heard
several connected words emerged at times
their purport was generally hopeful
on each of these occasions mrs verlocs dilated pupils losing their faroff fixity followed her husbands movements with the effect of black care and impenetrable attention
well informed upon all matters relating to his secret calling mr verloc augured well for the success of his plans and combinations
he really believed that it would be upon the whole easy for him to escape the knife of infuriated revolutionists
he had exaggerated the strength of their fury and the length of their arm for professional purposes too often to have many illusions one way or the other
for to exaggerate with judgment one must begin by measuring with nicety
he knew also how much virtue and how much infamy is forgotten in two yearstwo long years
his first really confidential discourse to his wife was optimistic from conviction
he also thought it good policy to display all the assurance he could muster
it would put heart into the poor woman
on his liberation which harmonising with the whole tenor of his life would be secret of course they would vanish together without loss of time
as to covering up the tracks he begged his wife to trust him for that
he knew how it was to be done so that the devil himself  he waved his hand
he seemed to boast
he wished only to put heart into her
it was a benevolent intention but mr verloc had the misfortune not to be in accord with his audience
the selfconfident tone grew upon mrs verlocs ear which let most of the words go by for what were words to her now
what could words do to her for good or evil in the face of her fixed idea
her black glance followed that man who was asserting his impunitythe man who had taken poor stevie from home to kill him somewhere
mrs verloc could not remember exactly where but her heart began to beat very perceptibly
mr verloc in a soft and conjugal tone was now expressing his firm belief that there were yet a good few years of quiet life before them both
he did not go into the question of means
a quiet life it must be and as it were nestling in the shade concealed among men whose flesh is grass modest like the life of violets
the words used by mr verloc were lie low for a bit  and far from england of course
it was not clear whether mr verloc had in his mind spain or south america but at any rate somewhere abroad
this last word falling into mrs verlocs ear produced a definite impression
this man was talking of going abroad
the impression was completely disconnected and such is the force of mental habit that mrs verloc at once and automatically asked herself and what of stevie  it was a sort of forgetfulness but instantly she became aware that there was no longer any occasion for anxiety on that score
there would never be any occasion any more
the poor boy had been taken out and killed
the poor boy was dead
this shaking piece of forgetfulness stimulated mrs verlocs intelligence
she began to perceive certain consequences which would have surprised mr verloc
there was no need for her now to stay there in that kitchen in that house with that mansince the boy was gone for ever
no need whatever
and on that mrs verloc rose as if raised by a spring
but neither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all
and this inability arrested her
mr verloc watched her with marital solicitude
youre looking more like yourself he said uneasily
something peculiar in the blackness of his wifes eyes disturbed his optimism
at that precise moment mrs verloc began to look upon herself as released from all earthly ties
she had her freedom
her contract with existence as represented by that man standing over there was at an end
she was a free woman
had this view become in some way perceptible to mr verloc he would have been extremely shocked
in his affairs of the heart mr verloc had been always carelessly generous yet always with no other idea than that of being loved for himself
upon this matter his ethical notions being in agreement with his vanity he was completely incorrigible
that this should be so in the case of his virtuous and legal connection he was perfectly certain
he had grown older fatter heavier in the belief that he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own sake
when he saw mrs verloc starting to walk out of the kitchen without a word he was disappointed
where are you going to he called out rather sharply
upstairs  mrs verloc in the doorway turned at the voice
an instinct of prudence born of fear the excessive fear of being approached and touched by that man induced her to nod at him slightly from the height of two steps with a stir of the lips which the conjugal optimism of mr verloc took for a wan and uncertain smile
thats right he encouraged her gruffly
rest and quiets what you want
go on
it wont be long before i am with you  mrs verloc the free woman who had had really no idea where she was going to obeyed the suggestion with rigid steadiness
mr verloc watched her
she disappeared up the stairs
he was disappointed
there was that within him which would have been more satisfied if she had been moved to throw herself upon his breast
but he was generous and indulgent
winnie was always undemonstrative and silent
neither was mr verloc himself prodigal of endearments and words as a rule
but this was not an ordinary evening
it was an occasion when a man wants to be fortified and strengthened by open proofs of sympathy and affection
mr verloc sighed and put out the gas in the kitchen
mr verlocs sympathy with his wife was genuine and intense
it almost brought tears into his eyes as he stood in the parlour reflecting on the loneliness hanging over her head
in this mood mr verloc missed stevie very much out of a difficult world
he thought mournfully of his end
if only that lad had not stupidly destroyed himself
the sensation of unappeasable hunger not unknown after the strain of a hazardous enterprise to adventurers of tougher fibre than mr verloc overcame him again
the piece of roast beef laid out in the likeness of funereal baked meats for stevies obsequies offered itself largely to his notice
and mr verloc again partook
he partook ravenously without restraint and decency cutting thick slices with the sharp carving knife and swallowing them without bread
in the course of that refection it occurred to mr verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the bedroom as he should have done
the thought of finding her perhaps sitting on the bed in the dark not only cut mr verlocs appetite but also took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet
laying down the carving knife mr verloc listened with careworn attention
he was comforted by hearing her move at last
she walked suddenly across the room and threw the window up
after a period of stillness up there during which he figured her to himself with her head out he heard the sash being lowered slowly
then she made a few steps and sat down
every resonance of his house was familiar to mr verloc who was thoroughly domesticated
when next he heard his wifes footsteps overhead he knew as well as if he had seen her doing it that she had been putting on her walking shoes
mr verloc wriggled his shoulders slightly at this ominous symptom and moving away from the table stood with his back to the fireplace his head on one side and gnawing perplexedly at the tips of his fingers
he kept track of her movements by the sound
she walked here and there violently with abrupt stoppages now before the chest of drawers then in front of the wardrobe
an immense load of weariness the harvest of a day of shocks and surprises weighed mr verlocs energies to the ground
he did not raise his eyes till he heard his wife descending the stairs
it was as he had guessed
she was dressed for going out
mrs verloc was a free woman
she had thrown open the window of the bedroom either with the intention of screaming murder
help
or of throwing herself out
for she did not exactly know what use to make of her freedom
her personality seemed to have been torn into two pieces whose mental operations did not adjust themselves very well to each other
the street silent and deserted from end to end repelled her by taking sides with that man who was so certain of his impunity
she was afraid to shout lest no one should come
obviously no one would come
her instinct of selfpreservation recoiled from the depth of the fall into that sort of slimy deep trench
mrs verloc closed the window and dressed herself to go out into the street by another way
she was a free woman
she had dressed herself thoroughly down to the tying of a black veil over her face
as she appeared before him in the light of the parlour mr verloc observed that she had even her little handbag hanging from her left wrist   
flying off to her mother of course
the thought that women were wearisome creatures after all presented itself to his fatigued brain
but he was too generous to harbour it for more than an instant
this man hurt cruelly in his vanity remained magnanimous in his conduct allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter smile or of a contemptuous gesture
with true greatness of soul he only glanced at the wooden clock on the wall and said in a perfectly calm but forcible manner  five and twenty minutes past eight winnie
theres no sense in going over there so late
you will never manage to get back tonight  before his extended hand mrs verloc had stopped short
he added heavily your mother will be gone to bed before you get there
this is the sort of news that can wait  nothing was further from mrs verlocs thoughts than going to her mother
she recoiled at the mere idea and feeling a chair behind her she obeyed the suggestion of the touch and sat down
her intention had been simply to get outside the door for ever
and if this feeling was correct its mental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her origin and station
i would rather walk the streets all the days of my life she thought
but this creature whose moral nature had been subjected to a shock of which in the physical order the most violent earthquake of history could only be a faint and languid rendering was at the mercy of mere trifles of casual contacts
she sat down
with her hat and veil she had the air of a visitor of having looked in on mr verloc for a moment
her instant docility encouraged him whilst her aspect of only temporary and silent acquiescence provoked him a little
let me tell you winnie he said with authority that your place is here this evening
hang it all
you brought the damned police high and low about my ears
i dont blame youbut its your doing all the same
youd better take this confounded hat off
i cant let you go out old girl he added in a softened voice
mrs verlocs mind got hold of that declaration with morbid tenacity
the man who had taken stevie out from under her very eyes to murder him in a locality whose name was at the moment not present to her memory would not allow her go out
of course he wouldnt
now he had murdered stevie he would never let her go
he would want to keep her for nothing
and on this characteristic reasoning having all the force of insane logic mrs verlocs disconnected wits went to work practically
she could slip by him open the door run out
but he would dash out after her seize her round the body drag her back into the shop
she could scratch kick and biteand stab too but for stabbing she wanted a knife
mrs verloc sat still under her black veil in her own house like a masked and mysterious visitor of impenetrable intentions
mr verlocs magnanimity was not more than human
she had exasperated him at last
cant you say something
you have your own dodges for vexing a man
oh yes
i know your deafanddumb trick
ive seen you at it before today
but just now it wont do
and to begin with take this damned thing off
one cant tell whether one is talking to a dummy or to a live woman  he advanced and stretching out his hand dragged the veil off unmasking a still unreadable face against which his nervous exasperation was shattered like a glass bubble flung against a rock
thats better he said to cover his momentary uneasiness and retreated back to his old station by the mantelpiece
it never entered his head that his wife could give him up
he felt a little ashamed of himself for he was fond and generous
what could he do
everything had been said already
he protested vehemently
by heavens
you know that i hunted high and low
i ran the risk of giving myself away to find somebody for that accursed job
and i tell you again i couldnt find anyone crazy enough or hungry enough
what do you take me fora murderer or what
the boy is gone
do you think i wanted him to blow himself up
hes gone
his troubles are over
ours are just going to begin i tell you precisely because he did blow himself
i dont blame you
but just try to understand that it was a pure accident as much an accident as if he had been run over by a bus while crossing the street  his generosity was not infinite because he was a human beingand not a monster as mrs verloc believed him to be
he paused and a snarl lifting his moustaches above a gleam of white teeth gave him the expression of a reflective beast not very dangerousa slow beast with a sleek head gloomier than a seal and with a husky voice
and when it comes to that its as much your doing as mine
thats so
you may glare as much as you like
i know what you can do in that way
strike me dead if i ever would have thought of the lad for that purpose
it was you who kept on shoving him in my way when i was half distracted with the worry of keeping the lot of us out of trouble
what the devil made you
one would think you were doing it on purpose
and i am damned if i know that you didnt
theres no saying how much of whats going on you have got hold of on the sly with your infernal dontcareadamn way of looking nowhere in particular and saying nothing at all      his husky domestic voice ceased for a while
mrs verloc made no reply
before that silence he felt ashamed of what he had said
but as often happens to peaceful men in domestic tiffs being ashamed he pushed another point
you have a devilish way of holding your tongue sometimes he began again without raising his voice
enough to make some men go mad
its lucky for you that i am not so easily put out as some of them would be by your deafanddumb sulks
i am fond of you
but dont you go too far
this isnt the time for it
we ought to be thinking of what weve got to do
and i cant let you go out tonight galloping off to your mother with some crazy tale or other about me
i wont have it
dont you make any mistake about it if you will have it that i killed the boy then youve killed him as much as i  in sincerity of feeling and openness of statement these words went far beyond anything that had ever been said in this home kept up on the wages of a secret industry eked out by the sale of more or less secret wares the poor expedients devised by a mediocre mankind for preserving an imperfect society from the dangers of moral and physical corruption both secret too of their kind
they were spoken because mr verloc had felt himself really outraged but the reticent decencies of this home life nestling in a shady street behind a shop where the sun never shone remained apparently undisturbed
mrs verloc heard him out with perfect propriety and then rose from her chair in her hat and jacket like a visitor at the end of a call
she advanced towards her husband one arm extended as if for a silent leavetaking
her net veil dangling down by one end on the left side of her face gave an air of disorderly formality to her restrained movements
but when she arrived as far as the hearthrug mr verloc was no longer standing there
he had moved off in the direction of the sofa without raising his eyes to watch the effect of his tirade
he was tired resigned in a truly marital spirit
but he felt hurt in the tender spot of his secret weakness
if she would go on sulking in that dreadful overcharged silencewhy then she must
she was a master in that domestic art
mr verloc flung himself heavily upon the sofa disregarding as usual the fate of his hat which as if accustomed to take care of itself made for a safe shelter under the table
he was tired
the last particle of his nervous force had been expended in the wonders and agonies of this day full of surprising failures coming at the end of a harassing month of scheming and insomnia
he was tired
a man isnt made of stone
hang everything
mr verloc reposed characteristically clad in his outdoor garments
one side of his open overcoat was lying partly on the ground
mr verloc wallowed on his back
but he longed for a more perfect restfor sleepfor a few hours of delicious forgetfulness
that would come later
provisionally he rested
and he thought i wish she would give over this damned nonsense
its exasperating  there must have been something imperfect in mrs verlocs sentiment of regained freedom
instead of taking the way of the door she leaned back with her shoulders against the tablet of the mantelpiece as a wayfarer rests against a fence
a tinge of wildness in her aspect was derived from the black veil hanging like a rag against her cheek and from the fixity of her black gaze where the light of the room was absorbed and lost without the trace of a single gleam
this woman capable of a bargain the mere suspicion of which would have been infinitely shocking to mr verlocs idea of love remained irresolute as if scrupulously aware of something wanting on her part for the formal closing of the transaction
on the sofa mr verloc wriggled his shoulders into perfect comfort and from the fulness of his heart emitted a wish which was certainly as pious as anything likely to come from such a source
i wish to goodness he growled huskily i had never seen greenwich park or anything belonging to it  the veiled sound filled the small room with its moderate volume well adapted to the modest nature of the wish
the waves of air of the proper length propagated in accordance with correct mathematical formulas flowed around all the inanimate things in the room lapped against mrs verlocs head as if it had been a head of stone
and incredible as it may appear the eyes of mrs verloc seemed to grow still larger
the audible wish of mr verlocs overflowing heart flowed into an empty place in his wifes memory
greenwich park
a park
thats where the boy was killed
a parksmashed branches torn leaves gravel bits of brotherly flesh and bone all spouting up together in the manner of a firework
she remembered now what she had heard and she remembered it pictorially
they had to gather him up with the shovel
trembling all over with irrepressible shudders she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground
mrs verloc closed her eyes desperately throwing upon that vision the night of her eyelids where after a rainlike fall of mangled limbs the decapitated head of stevie lingered suspended alone and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic display
mrs verloc opened her eyes
her face was no longer stony
anybody could have noted the subtle change on her features in the stare of her eyes giving her a new and startling expression an expression seldom observed by competent persons under the conditions of leisure and security demanded for thorough analysis but whose meaning could not be mistaken at a glance
mrs verlocs doubts as to the end of the bargain no longer existed her wits no longer disconnected were working under the control of her will
but mr verloc observed nothing
he was reposing in that pathetic condition of optimism induced by excess of fatigue
he did not want any more troublewith his wife tooof all people in the world
he had been unanswerable in his vindication
he was loved for himself
the present phase of her silence he interpreted favourably
this was the time to make it up with her
the silence had lasted long enough
he broke it by calling to her in an undertone
winnie  yes answered obediently mrs verloc the free woman
she commanded her wits now her vocal organs she felt herself to be in an almost preternaturally perfect control of every fibre of her body
it was all her own because the bargain was at an end
she was clear sighted
she had become cunning
she chose to answer him so readily for a purpose
she did not wish that man to change his position on the sofa which was very suitable to the circumstances
she succeeded
the man did not stir
but after answering him she remained leaning negligently against the mantelpiece in the attitude of a resting wayfarer
she was unhurried
her brow was smooth
the head and shoulders of mr verloc were hidden from her by the high side of the sofa
she kept her eyes fixed on his feet
she remained thus mysteriously still and suddenly collected till mr verloc was heard with an accent of marital authority and moving slightly to make room for her to sit on the edge of the sofa
come here he said in a peculiar tone which might have been the tone of brutality but was intimately known to mrs verloc as the note of wooing
she started forward at once as if she were still a loyal woman bound to that man by an unbroken contract
her right hand skimmed slightly the end of the table and when she had passed on towards the sofa the carving knife had vanished without the slightest sound from the side of the dish
mr verloc heard the creaky plank in the floor and was content
he waited
mrs verloc was coming
as if the homeless soul of stevie had flown for shelter straight to the breast of his sister guardian and protector the resemblance of her face with that of her brother grew at every step even to the droop of the lower lip even to the slight divergence of the eyes
but mr verloc did not see that
he was lying on his back and staring upwards
he saw partly on the ceiling and partly on the wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched hand holding a carving knife
it flickered up and down
its movements were leisurely
they were leisurely enough for mr verloc to recognise the limb and the weapon
they were leisurely enough for him to take in the full meaning of the portent and to taste the flavour of death rising in his gorge
his wife had gone raving madmurdering mad
they were leisurely enough for the first paralysing effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that armed lunatic
they were leisurely enough for mr verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the table and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair
but they were not leisurely enough to allow mr verloc the time to move either hand or foot
the knife was already planted in his breast
it met no resistance on its way
hazard has such accuracies
into that plunging blow delivered over the side of the couch mrs verloc had put all the inheritance of her immemorial and obscure descent the simple ferocity of the age of caverns and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of barrooms
mr verloc the secret agent turning slightly on his side with the force of the blow expired without stirring a limb in the muttered sound of the word dont by way of protest
mrs verloc had let go the knife and her extraordinary resemblance to her late brother had faded had become very ordinary now
she drew a deep breath the first easy breath since chief inspector heat had exhibited to her the labelled piece of stevies overcoat
she leaned forward on her folded arms over the side of the sofa
she adopted that easy attitude not in order to watch or gloat over the body of mr verloc but because of the undulatory and swinging movements of the parlour which for some time behaved as though it were at sea in a tempest
she was giddy but calm
she had become a free woman with a perfection of freedom which left her nothing to desire and absolutely nothing to do since stevies urgent claim on her devotion no longer existed
mrs verloc who thought in images was not troubled now by visions because she did not think at all
and she did not move
she was a woman enjoying her complete irresponsibility and endless leisure almost in the manner of a corpse
she did not move she did not think
neither did the mortal envelope of the late mr verloc reposing on the sofa
except for the fact that mrs verloc breathed these two would have been perfect in accord that accord of prudent reserve without superfluous words and sparing of signs which had been the foundation of their respectable home life
for it had been respectable covering by a decent reticence the problems that may arise in the practice of a secret profession and the commerce of shady wares
to the last its decorum had remained undisturbed by unseemly shrieks and other misplaced sincerities of conduct
and after the striking of the blow this respectability was continued in immobility and silence
nothing moved in the parlour till mrs verloc raised her head slowly and looked at the clock with inquiring mistrust
she had become aware of a ticking sound in the room
it grew upon her ear while she remembered clearly that the clock on the wall was silent had no audible tick
what did it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden
its face indicated ten minutes to nine
mrs verloc cared nothing for time and the ticking went on
she concluded it could not be the clock and her sullen gaze moved along the walls wavered and became vague while she strained her hearing to locate the sound
tic tic tic
after listening for some time mrs verloc lowered her gaze deliberately on her husbands body
its attitude of repose was so homelike and familiar that she could do so without feeling embarrassed by any pronounced novelty in the phenomena of her home life
mr verloc was taking his habitual ease
he looked comfortable
by the position of the body the face of mr verloc was not visible to mrs verloc his widow
her fine sleepy eyes travelling downward on the track of the sound became contemplative on meeting a flat object of bone which protruded a little beyond the edge of the sofa
it was the handle of the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its position at right angles to mr verlocs waistcoat and the fact that something dripped from it
dark drops fell on the floorcloth one after another with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock
at its highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of trickling
mrs verloc watched that transformation with shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face
it was a trickle dark swift thin   
blood
at this unforeseen circumstance mrs verloc abandoned her pose of idleness and irresponsibility
with a sudden snatch at her skirts and a faint shriek she ran to the door as if the trickle had been the first sign of a destroying flood
finding the table in her way she gave it a push with both hands as though it had been alive with such force that it went for some distance on its four legs making a loud scraping racket whilst the big dish with the joint crashed heavily on the floor
then all became still
mrs verloc on reaching the door had stopped
a round hat disclosed in the middle of the floor by the moving of the table rocked slightly on its crown in the wind of her flight
chapter xii   winnie verloc the widow of mr verloc the sister of the late faithful stevie blown to fragments in a state of innocence and in the conviction of being engaged in a humanitarian enterprise did not run beyond the door of the parlour
she had indeed run away so far from a mere trickle of blood but that was a movement of instinctive repulsion
and there she had paused with staring eyes and lowered head
as though she had run through long years in her flight across the small parlour mrs verloc by the door was quite a different person from the woman who had been leaning over the sofa a little swimmy in her head but otherwise free to enjoy the profound calm of idleness and irresponsibility
mrs verloc was no longer giddy
her head was steady
on the other hand she was no longer calm
she was afraid
if she avoided looking in the direction of her reposing husband it was not because she was afraid of him
mr verloc was not frightful to behold
he looked comfortable
moreover he was dead
mrs verloc entertained no vain delusions on the subject of the dead
nothing brings them back neither love nor hate
they can do nothing to you
they are as nothing
her mental state was tinged by a sort of austere contempt for that man who had let himself be killed so easily
he had been the master of a house the husband of a woman and the murderer of her stevie
and now he was of no account in every respect
he was of less practical account than the clothing on his body than his overcoat than his bootsthan that hat lying on the floor
he was nothing
he was not worth looking at
he was even no longer the murderer of poor stevie
the only murderer that would be found in the room when people came to look for mr verloc would beherself
her hands shook so that she failed twice in the task of refastening her veil
mrs verloc was no longer a person of leisure and responsibility
she was afraid
the stabbing of mr verloc had been only a blow
it had relieved the pentup agony of shrieks strangled in her throat of tears dried up in her hot eyes of the maddening and indignant rage at the atrocious part played by that man who was less than nothing now in robbing her of the boy
it had been an obscurely prompted blow
the blood trickling on the floor off the handle of the knife had turned it into an extremely plain case of murder
mrs verloc who always refrained from looking deep into things was compelled to look into the very bottom of this thing
she saw there no haunting face no reproachful shade no vision of remorse no sort of ideal conception
she saw there an object
that object was the gallows
mrs verloc was afraid of the gallows
she was terrified of them ideally
having never set eyes on that last argument of mens justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain type of tales she first saw them erect against a black and stormy background festooned with chains and human bones circled about by birds that peck at dead mens eyes
this was frightful enough but mrs verloc though not a wellinformed woman had a sufficient knowledge of the institutions of her country to know that gallows are no longer erected romantically on the banks of dismal rivers or on windswept headlands but in the yards of jails
there within four high walls as if into a pit at dawn of day the murderer was brought out to be executed with a horrible quietness and as the reports in the newspapers always said in the presence of the authorities  with her eyes staring on the floor her nostrils quivering with anguish and shame she imagined herself all alone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly proceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck
thatnever
never
and how was it done
the impossibility of imagining the details of such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror
the newspapers never gave any details except one but that one with some affectation was always there at the end of a meagre report
mrs verloc remembered its nature
it came with a cruel burning pain into her head as if the words the drop given was fourteen feet had been scratched on her brain with a hot needle
the drop given was fourteen feet  these words affected her physically too
her throat became convulsed in waves to resist strangulation and the apprehension of the jerk was so vivid that she seized her head in both hands as if to save it from being torn off her shoulders
the drop given was fourteen feet  no
that must never be
she could not stand that
the thought of it even was not bearable
she could not stand thinking of it
therefore mrs verloc formed the resolution to go at once and throw herself into the river off one of the bridges
this time she managed to refasten her veil
with her face as if masked all black from head to foot except for some flowers in her hat she looked up mechanically at the clock
she thought it must have stopped
she could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had looked at it last
of course not
it had been stopped all the time
as a matter of fact only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had drawn the first deep easy breath after the blow to this moment when mrs verloc formed the resolution to drown herself in the thames
but mrs verloc could not believe that
she seemed to have heard or read that clocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing of the murderer
she did not care
to the bridgeand over i go 
 
but her movements were slow
she dragged herself painfully across the shop and had to hold on to the handle of the door before she found the necessary fortitude to open it
the street frightened her since it led either to the gallows or to the river
she floundered over the doorstep head forward arms thrown out like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge
this entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning a slimy dampness enveloped her entered her nostrils clung to her hair
it was not actually raining but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist
the van and horses were gone and in the black street the curtained window of the carters eatinghouse made a square patch of soiled bloodred light glowing faintly very near the level of the pavement
mrs verloc dragging herself slowly towards it thought that she was a very friendless woman
it was true
it was so true that in a sudden longing to see some friendly face she could think of no one else but of mrs neale the charwoman
she had no acquaintances of her own
nobody would miss her in a social way
it must not be imagined that the widow verloc had forgotten her mother
this was not so
winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister
her mother had always leaned on her for support
no consolation or advice could be expected there
now that stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken
she could not face the old woman with the horrible tale
moreover it was too far
the river was her present destination
mrs verloc tried to forget her mother
each step cost her an effort of will which seemed the last possible
mrs verloc had dragged herself past the red glow of the eatinghouse window
to the bridgeand over i go she repeated to herself with fierce obstinacy
she put out her hand just in time to steady herself against a lamppost
ill never get there before morning she thought
the fear of death paralysed her efforts to escape the gallows
it seemed to her she had been staggering in that street for hours
ill never get there she thought
theyll find me knocking about the streets
its too far  she held on panting under her black veil
the drop given was fourteen feet  she pushed the lamppost away from her violently and found herself walking
but another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea washing away her heart clean out of her breast
i will never get there she muttered suddenly arrested swaying lightly where she stood
never  and perceiving the utter impossibility of walking as far as the nearest bridge mrs verloc thought of a flight abroad
it came to her suddenly
murderers escaped
they escaped abroad
spain or california
mere names
the vast world created for the glory of man was only a vast blank to mrs verloc
she did not know which way to turn
murderers had friends relations helpersthey had knowledge
she had nothing
she was the most lonely of murderers that ever struck a mortal blow
she was alone in london and the whole town of marvels and mud with its maze of streets and its mass of lights was sunk in a hopeless night rested at the bottom of a black abyss from which no unaided woman could hope to scramble out
she swayed forward and made a fresh start blindly with an awful dread of falling down but at the end of a few steps unexpectedly she found a sensation of support of security
raising her head she saw a mans face peering closely at her veil
comrade ossipon was not afraid of strange women and no feeling of false delicacy could prevent him from striking an acquaintance with a woman apparently very much intoxicated
comrade ossipon was interested in women
he held up this one between his two large palms peering at her in a businesslike way till he heard her say faintly mr ossipon and then he very nearly let her drop to the ground
mrs verloc he exclaimed
you here  it seemed impossible to him that she should have been drinking
but one never knows
he did not go into that question but attentive not to discourage kind fate surrendering to him the widow of comrade verloc he tried to draw her to his breast
to his astonishment she came quite easily and even rested on his arm for a moment before she attempted to disengage herself
comrade ossipon would not be brusque with kind fate
he withdrew his arm in a natural way
you recognised me she faltered out standing before him fairly steady on her legs
of course i did said ossipon with perfect readiness
i was afraid you were going to fall
ive thought of you too often lately not to recognise you anywhere at any time
ive always thought of youever since i first set eyes on you  mrs verloc seemed not to hear
you were coming to the shop she said nervously
yes at once answered ossipon
directly i read the paper  in fact comrade ossipon had been skulking for a good two hours in the neighbourhood of brett street unable to make up his mind for a bold move
the robust anarchist was not exactly a bold conqueror
he remembered that mrs verloc had never responded to his glances by the slightest sign of encouragement
besides he thought the shop might be watched by the police and comrade ossipon did not wish the police to form an exaggerated notion of his revolutionary sympathies
even now he did not know precisely what to do
in comparison with his usual amatory speculations this was a big and serious undertaking
he ignored how much there was in it and how far he would have to go in order to get hold of what there was to getsupposing there was a chance at all
these perplexities checking his elation imparted to his tone a soberness well in keeping with the circumstances
may i ask you where you were going he inquired in a subdued voice
dont ask me cried mrs verloc with a shuddering repressed violence
all her strong vitality recoiled from the idea of death
never mind where i was going
    ossipon concluded that she was very much excited but perfectly sober
she remained silent by his side for moment then all at once she did something which he did not expect
she slipped her hand under his arm
he was startled by the act itself certainly and quite as much too by the palpably resolute character of this movement
but this being a delicate affair comrade ossipon behaved with delicacy
he contented himself by pressing the hand slightly against his robust ribs
at the same time he felt himself being impelled forward and yielded to the impulse
at the end of brett street he became aware of being directed to the left
he submitted
the fruiterer at the corner had put out the blazing glory of his oranges and lemons and brett place was all darkness interspersed with the misty halos of the few lamps defining its triangular shape with a cluster of three lights on one stand in the middle
the dark forms of the man and woman glided slowly arm in arm along the walls with a loverlike and homeless aspect in the miserable night
what would you say if i were to tell you that i was going to find you mrs verloc asked gripping his arm with force
i would say that you couldnt find anyone more ready to help you in your trouble answered ossipon with a notion of making tremendous headway
in fact the progress of this delicate affair was almost taking his breath away
in my trouble mrs verloc repeated slowly
yes  and do you know what my trouble is she whispered with strange intensity
ten minutes after seeing the evening paper explained ossipon with ardour i met a fellow whom you may have seen once or twice at the shop perhaps and i had a talk with him which left no doubt whatever in my mind
then i started for here wondering whether youive been fond of you beyond words ever since i set eyes on your face he cried as if unable to command his feelings
comrade ossipon assumed correctly that no woman was capable of wholly disbelieving such a statement
but he did not know that mrs verloc accepted it with all the fierceness the instinct of selfpreservation puts into the grip of a drowning person
to the widow of mr verloc the robust anarchist was like a radiant messenger of life
they walked slowly in step
i thought so mrs verloc murmured faintly
youve read it in my eyes suggested ossipon with great assurance
yes she breathed out into his inclined ear
a love like mine could not be concealed from a woman like you he went on trying to detach his mind from material considerations such as the business value of the shop and the amount of money mr verloc might have left in the bank
he applied himself to the sentimental side of the affair
in his heart of hearts he was a little shocked at his success
verloc had been a good fellow and certainly a very decent husband as far as one could see
however comrade ossipon was not going to quarrel with his luck for the sake of a dead man
resolutely he suppressed his sympathy for the ghost of comrade verloc and went on
i could not conceal it
i was too full of you
i daresay you could not help seeing it in my eyes
but i could not guess it
you were always so distant
    what else did you expect burst out mrs verloc
i was a respectable woman  she paused then added as if speaking to herself in sinister resentment till he made me what i am  ossipon let that pass and took up his running
he never did seem to me to be quite worthy of you he began throwing loyalty to the winds
you were worthy of a better fate  mrs verloc interrupted bitterly  better fate
he cheated me out of seven years of life  you seemed to live so happily with him  ossipon tried to exculpate the lukewarmness of his past conduct
its that whats made me timid
you seemed to love him
i was surprisedand jealous he added
love him mrs verloc cried out in a whisper full of scorn and rage
love him
i was a good wife to him
i am a respectable woman
you thought i loved him
you did
look here tom  the sound of this name thrilled comrade ossipon with pride
for his name was alexander and he was called tom by arrangement with the most familiar of his intimates
it was a name of friendshipof moments of expansion
he had no idea that she had ever heard it used by anybody
it was apparent that she had not only caught it but had treasured it in her memoryperhaps in her heart
look here tom
i was a young girl
i was done up
i was tired
i had two people depending on what i could do and it did seem as if i couldnt do any more
two peoplemother and the boy
he was much more mine than mothers
i sat up nights and nights with him on my lap all alone upstairs when i wasnt more than eight years old myself
and thenhe was mine i tell you    you cant understand that
no man can understand it
what was i to do
there was a young fellow  the memory of the early romance with the young butcher survived tenacious like the image of a glimpsed ideal in that heart quailing before the fear of the gallows and full of revolt against death
that was the man i loved then went on the widow of mr verloc
i suppose he could see it in my eyes too
five and twenty shillings a week and his father threatened to kick him out of the business if he made such a fool of himself as to marry a girl with a crippled mother and a crazy idiot of a boy on her hands
but he would hang about me till one evening i found the courage to slam the door in his face
i had to do it
i loved him dearly
five and twenty shillings a week
there was that other mana good lodger
what is a girl to do
could ive gone on the streets
he seemed kind
he wanted me anyhow
what was i to do with mother and that poor boy
eh
i said yes
he seemed goodnatured he was freehanded he had money he never said anything
seven yearsseven years a good wife to him the kind the good the generous theand he loved me
oh yes
he loved me till i sometimes wished myselfseven years
seven years a wife to him
and do you know what he was that dear friend of yours
do you know what he was
he was a devil  the superhuman vehemence of that whispered statement completely stunned comrade ossipon
winnie verloc turning about held him by both arms facing him under the falling mist in the darkness and solitude of brett place in which all sounds of life seemed lost as if in a triangular well of asphalt and bricks of blind houses and unfeeling stones
no i didnt know he declared with a sort of flabby stupidity whose comical aspect was lost upon a woman haunted by the fear of the gallows but i do now
ii understand he floundered on his mind speculating as to what sort of atrocities verloc could have practised under the sleepy placid appearances of his married estate
it was positively awful
i understand he repeated and then by a sudden inspiration uttered anunhappy woman of lofty commiseration instead of the more familiar poor darling of his usual practice
this was no usual case
he felt conscious of something abnormal going on while he never lost sight of the greatness of the stake
unhappy brave woman  he was glad to have discovered that variation but he could discover nothing else
ah but he is dead now was the best he could do
and he put a remarkable amount of animosity into his guarded exclamation
mrs verloc caught at his arm with a sort of frenzy
you guessed then he was dead she murmured as if beside herself
you
you guessed what i had to do
had to  there were suggestions of triumph relief gratitude in the indefinable tone of these words
it engrossed the whole attention of ossipon to the detriment of mere literal sense
he wondered what was up with her why she had worked herself into this state of wild excitement
he even began to wonder whether the hidden causes of that greenwich park affair did not lie deep in the unhappy circumstances of the verlocs married life
he went so far as to suspect mr verloc of having selected that extraordinary manner of committing suicide
by jove
that would account for the utter inanity and wrongheadedness of the thing
no anarchist manifestation was required by the circumstances
quite the contrary and verloc was as well aware of that as any other revolutionist of his standing
what an immense joke if verloc had simply made fools of the whole of europe of the revolutionary world of the police of the press and of the cocksure professor as well
indeed thought ossipon in astonishment it seemed almost certain that he did
poor beggar
it struck him as very possible that of that household of two it wasnt precisely the man who was the devil
alexander ossipon nicknamed the doctor was naturally inclined to think indulgently of his men friends
he eyed mrs verloc hanging on his arm
of his women friends he thought in a specially practical way
why mrs verloc should exclaim at his knowledge of mr verlocs death which was no guess at all did not disturb him beyond measure
they often talked like lunatics
but he was curious to know how she had been informed
the papers could tell her nothing beyond the mere fact the man blown to pieces in greenwich park not having been identified
it was inconceivable on any theory that verloc should have given her an inkling of his intentionwhatever it was
this problem interested comrade ossipon immensely
he stopped short
they had gone then along the three sides of brett place and were near the end of brett street again
how did you first come to hear of it he asked in a tone he tried to render appropriate to the character of the revelations which had been made to him by the woman at his side
she shook violently for a while before she answered in a listless voice
from the police
a chief inspector came chief inspector heat he said he was
he showed me  mrs verloc choked
oh tom they had to gather him up with a shovel  her breast heaved with dry sobs
in a moment ossipon found his tongue
the police
do you mean to say the police came already
that chief inspector heat himself actually came to tell you  yes she confirmed in the same listless tone
he came just like this
he came
i didnt know
he showed me a piece of overcoat andjust like that
do you know this
he says  heat
heat
and what did he do  mrs verlocs head dropped
nothing
he did nothing
he went away
the police were on that mans side she murmured tragically
another one came too  anotheranother inspector do you mean asked ossipon in great excitement and very much in the tone of a scared child
i dont know
he came
he looked like a foreigner
he may have been one of them embassy people  comrade ossipon nearly collapsed under this new shock
embassy
are you aware what you are saying
what embassy
what on earth do you mean by embassy  its that place in chesham square
the people he cursed so
i dont know
what does it matter  and that fellow what did he do or say to you  i dont remember   
nothing    
i dont care
dont ask me she pleaded in a weary voice
all right
i wont assented ossipon tenderly
and he meant it too not because he was touched by the pathos of the pleading voice but because he felt himself losing his footing in the depths of this tenebrous affair
police
embassy
phew
for fear of adventuring his intelligence into ways where its natural lights might fail to guide it safely he dismissed resolutely all suppositions surmises and theories out of his mind
he had the woman there absolutely flinging herself at him and that was the principal consideration
but after what he had heard nothing could astonish him any more
and when mrs verloc as if startled suddenly out of a dream of safety began to urge upon him wildly the necessity of an immediate flight on the continent he did not exclaim in the least
he simply said with unaffected regret that there was no train till the morning and stood looking thoughtfully at her face veiled in black net in the light of a gas lamp veiled in a gauze of mist
near him her black form merged in the night like a figure half chiselled out of a block of black stone
it was impossible to say what she knew how deep she was involved with policemen and embassies
but if she wanted to get away it was not for him to object
he was anxious to be off himself
he felt that the business the shop so strangely familiar to chief inspectors and members of foreign embassies was not the place for him
that must be dropped
but there was the rest
these savings
the money
you must hide me till the morning somewhere she said in a dismayed voice
fact is my dear i cant take you where i live
i share the room with a friend  he was somewhat dismayed himself
in the morning the blessed tecs will be out in all the stations no doubt
and if they once got hold of her for one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed
but you must
dont you care for me at allat all
what are you thinking of  she said this violently but she let her clasped hands fall in discouragement
there was a silence while the mist fell and darkness reigned undisturbed over brett place
not a soul not even the vagabond lawless and amorous soul of a cat came near the man and the woman facing each other
it would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere ossipon spoke at last
but the truth is my dear i have not enough money to go and try withonly a few pence
we revolutionists are not rich  he had fifteen shillings in his pocket
he added  and theres the journey before us toofirst thing in the morning at that  she did not move made no sound and comrade ossipons heart sank a little
apparently she had no suggestion to offer
suddenly she clutched at her breast as if she had felt a sharp pain there
but i have she gasped
i have the money
i have enough money
tom
let us go from here  how much have you got he inquired without stirring to her tug for he was a cautious man
i have the money i tell you
all the money  what do you mean by it
all the money there was in the bank or what he asked incredulously but ready not to be surprised at anything in the way of luck
yes yes she said nervously
all there was
ive it all  how on earth did you manage to get hold of it already he marvelled
he gave it to me she murmured suddenly subdued and trembling
comrade ossipon put down his rising surprise with a firm hand
why thenwe are saved he uttered slowly
she leaned forward and sank against his breast
he welcomed her there
she had all the money
her hat was in the way of very marked effusion her veil too
he was adequate in his manifestations but no more
she received them without resistance and without abandonment passively as if only halfsensible
she freed herself from his lax embraces without difficulty
you will save me tom she broke out recoiling but still keeping her hold on him by the two lapels of his damp coat
save me
hide me
dont let them have me
you must kill me first
i couldnt do it myselfi couldnt i couldntnot even for what i am afraid of  she was confoundedly bizarre he thought
she was beginning to inspire him with an indefinite uneasiness
he said surlily for he was busy with important thoughts  what the devil are you afraid of  havent you guessed what i was driven to do cried the woman
distracted by the vividness of her dreadful apprehensions her head ringing with forceful words that kept the horror of her position before her mind she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself
she had no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed phrases completed only in her thought
she had felt the relief of a full confession and she gave a special meaning to every sentence spoken by comrade ossipon whose knowledge did not in the least resemble her own
havent you guessed what i was driven to do  her voice fell
you neednt be long in guessing then what i am afraid of she continued in a bitter and sombre murmur
i wont have it
i wont
i wont
i wont
you must promise to kill me first  she shook the lapels of his coat
it must never be  he assured her curtly that no promises on his part were necessary but he took good care not to contradict her in set terms because he had had much to do with excited women and he was inclined in general to let his experience guide his conduct in preference to applying his sagacity to each special case
his sagacity in this case was busy in other directions
womens words fell into water but the shortcomings of timetables remained
the insular nature of great britain obtruded itself upon his notice in an odious form
might just as well be put under lock and key every night he thought irritably as nonplussed as though he had a wall to scale with the woman on his back
suddenly he slapped his forehead
he had by dint of cudgelling his brains just thought of the southamptonst malo service
the boat left about midnight
there was a train at 
he became cheery and ready to act
from waterloo
plenty of time
we are all right after all    whats the matter now
this isnt the way he protested
mrs verloc having hooked her arm into his was trying to drag him into brett street again
ive forgotten to shut the shop door as i went out she whispered terribly agitated
the shop and all that was in it had ceased to interest comrade ossipon
he knew how to limit his desires
he was on the point of saying what of that
let it be but he refrained
he disliked argument about trifles
he even mended his pace considerably on the thought that she might have left the money in the drawer
but his willingness lagged behind her feverish impatience
the shop seemed to be quite dark at first
the door stood ajar
mrs verloc leaning against the front gasped out  nobody has been in
look
the lightthe light in the parlour  ossipon stretching his head forward saw a faint gleam in the darkness of the shop
there is he said
i forgot it mrs verlocs voice came from behind her veil faintly
and as he stood waiting for her to enter first she said louder go in and put it outor ill go mad  he made no immediate objection to this proposal so strangely motived
wheres all that money he asked
on me
go tom
quick
put it out    go in she cried seizing him by both shoulders from behind
not prepared for a display of physical force comrade ossipon stumbled far into the shop before her push
he was astonished at the strength of the woman and scandalised by her proceedings
but he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street
he was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour
moreover this or never was the time to humour the woman
comrade ossipon avoided easily the end of the counter and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour
the curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he by a very natural impulse looked in just as he made ready to turn the handle
he looked in without a thought without intention without curiosity of any sort
he looked in because he could not help looking in
he looked in and discovered mr verloc reposing quietly on the sofa
a yell coming from the innermost depths of his chest died out unheard and transformed into a sort of greasy sickly taste on his lips
at the same time the mental personality of comrade ossipon executed a frantic leap backward
but his body left thus without intellectual guidance held on to the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct
the robust anarchist did not even totter
and he stared his face close to the glass his eyes protruding out of his head
he would have given anything to get away but his returning reason informed him that it would not do to let go the door handle
what was itmadness a nightmare or a trap into which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness
whywhat for
he did not know
without any sense of guilt in his breast in the full peace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned the idea that he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple verloc passed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach and went out leaving behind a trail of sickly faintnessan indisposition
comrade ossipon did not feel very well in a very special way for a momenta long moment
and he stared
mr verloc lay very still meanwhile simulating sleep for reasons of his own while that savage woman of his was guarding the doorinvisible and silent in the dark and deserted street
was all this a some sort of terrifying arrangement invented by the police for his especial benefit
his modesty shrank from that explanation
but the true sense of the scene he was beholding came to ossipon through the contemplation of the hat
it seemed an extraordinary thing an ominous object a sign
black and rim upward it lay on the floor before the couch as if prepared to receive the contributions of pence from people who would come presently to behold mr verloc in the fullness of his domestic ease reposing on a sofa
from the hat the eyes of the robust anarchist wandered to the displaced table gazed at the broken dish for a time received a kind of optical shock from observing a white gleam under the imperfectly closed eyelids of the man on the couch
mr verloc did not seem so much asleep now as lying down with a bent head and looking insistently at his left breast
and when comrade ossipon had made out the handle of the knife he turned away from the glazed door and retched violently
the crash of the street door flung to made his very soul leap in a panic
this house with its harmless tenant could still be made a trap ofa trap of a terrible kind
comrade ossipon had no settled conception now of what was happening to him
catching his thigh against the end of the counter he spun round staggered with a cry of pain felt in the distracting clatter of the bell his arms pinned to his side by a convulsive hug while the cold lips of a woman moved creepily on his very ear to form the words  policeman
he has seen me  he ceased to struggle she never let him go
her hands had locked themselves with an inseparable twist of fingers on his robust back
while the footsteps approached they breathed quickly breast to breast with hard laboured breaths as if theirs had been the attitude of a deadly struggle while in fact it was the attitude of deadly fear
and the time was long
the constable on the beat had in truth seen something of mrs verloc only coming from the lighted thoroughfare at the other end of brett street she had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness
and he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter
he had no reason to hurry up
on coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early
there was nothing very unusual in that
the men on duty had special instructions about that shop what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly but any observations made were to be reported
there were no observations to make but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness the constable crossed the road and tried the door
the spring latch whose key was reposing for ever off duty in the late mr verlocs waistcoat pocket held as well as usual
while the conscientious officer was shaking the handle ossipon felt the cold lips of the woman stirring again creepily against his very ear  if he comes in kill mekill me tom  the constable moved away flashing as he passed the light of his dark lantern merely for forms sake at the shop window
for a moment longer the man and the woman inside stood motionless panting breast to breast then her fingers came unlocked her arms fell by her side slowly
ossipon leaned against the counter
the robust anarchist wanted support badly
this was awful
he was almost too disgusted for speech
yet he managed to utter a plaintive thought showing at least that he realised his position
only a couple of minutes later and youd have made me blunder against the fellow poking about here with his damned dark lantern  the widow of mr verloc motionless in the middle of the shop said insistently  go in and put that light out tom
it will drive me crazy  she saw vaguely his vehement gesture of refusal
nothing in the world would have induced ossipon to go into the parlour
he was not superstitious but there was too much blood on the floor a beastly pool of it all round the hat
he judged he had been already far too near that corpse for his peace of mindfor the safety of his neck perhaps
at the meter then
there
look
in that corner  the robust form of comrade ossipon striding brusque and shadowy across the shop squatted in a corner obediently but this obedience was without grace
he fumbled nervouslyand suddenly in the sound of a muttered curse the light behind the glazed door flicked out to a gasping hysterical sigh of a woman
night the inevitable reward of mens faithful labours on this earth night had fallen on mr verloc the tried revolutionistone of the old lotthe humble guardian of society the invaluable secret agent delta of baron stottwartenheims despatches a servant of law and order faithful trusted accurate admirable with perhaps one single amiable weakness the idealistic belief in being loved for himself
ossipon groped his way back through the stuffy atmosphere as black as ink now to the counter
the voice of mrs verloc standing in the middle of the shop vibrated after him in that blackness with a desperate protest
i will not be hanged tom
i will not  she broke off
ossipon from the counter issued a warning dont shout like this then seemed to reflect profoundly
you did this thing quite by yourself he inquired in a hollow voice but with an appearance of masterful calmness which filled mrs verlocs heart with grateful confidence in his protecting strength
yes she whispered invisible
i wouldnt have believed it possible he muttered
nobody would she heard him move about and the snapping of a lock in the parlour door
comrade ossipon had turned the key on mr verlocs repose and this he did not from reverence for its eternal nature or any other obscurely sentimental consideration but for the precise reason that he was not at all sure that there was not someone else hiding somewhere in the house
he did not believe the woman or rather he was incapable by now of judging what could be true possible or even probable in this astounding universe
he was terrified out of all capacity for belief or disbelief in regard of this extraordinary affair which began with police inspectors and embassies and would end goodness knows whereon the scaffold for someone
he was terrified at the thought that he could not prove the use he made of his time ever since seven oclock for he had been skulking about brett street
he was terrified at this savage woman who had brought him in there and would probably saddle him with complicity at least if he were not careful
he was terrified at the rapidity with which he had been involved in such dangersdecoyed into it
it was some twenty minutes since he had met hernot more
the voice of mrs verloc rose subdued pleading piteously dont let them hang me tom
take me out of the country
ill work for you
ill slave for you
ill love you
ive no one in the world     who would look at me if you dont  she ceased for a moment then in the depths of the loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of blood trickling off the handle of a knife she found a dreadful inspiration to herwho had been the respectable girl of the belgravian mansion the loyal respectable wife of mr verloc
i wont ask you to marry me she breathed out in shamefaced accents
she moved a step forward in the darkness
he was terrified at her
he would not have been surprised if she had suddenly produced another knife destined for his breast
he certainly would have made no resistance
he had really not enough fortitude in him just then to tell her to keep back
but he inquired in a cavernous strange tone was he asleep  no she cried and went on rapidly
he wasnt
not he
he had been telling me that nothing could touch him
after taking the boy away from under my very eyes to kill himthe loving innocent harmless lad
my own i tell you
he was lying on the couch quite easyafter killing the boymy boy
i would have gone on the streets to get out of his sight
and he says to me like this come here after telling me i had helped to kill the boy
you hear tom
he says like this come here after taking my very heart out of me along with the boy to smash in the dirt  she ceased then dreamily repeated twice blood and dirt
blood and dirt  a great light broke upon comrade ossipon
it was that halfwitted lad then who had perished in the park
and the fooling of everybody all round appeared more complete than evercolossal
he exclaimed scientifically in the extremity of his astonishment the degenerateby heavens  come here  the voice of mrs verloc rose again
what did he think i was made of
tell me tom
come here
me
like this
i had been looking at the knife and i thought i would come then if he wanted me so much
oh yes
i camefor the last time    with the knife  he was excessively terrified at herthe sister of the degeneratea degenerate herself of a murdering type 
  or else of the lying type
comrade ossipon might have been said to be terrified scientifically in addition to all other kinds of fear
it was an immeasurable and composite funk which from its very excess gave him in the dark a false appearance of calm and thoughtful deliberation
for he moved and spoke with difficulty being as if half frozen in his will and mindand no one could see his ghastly face
he felt half dead
he leaped a foot high
unexpectedly mrs verloc had desecrated the unbroken reserved decency of her home by a shrill and terrible shriek
help tom
save me
i wont be hanged  he rushed forward groping for her mouth with a silencing hand and the shriek died out
but in his rush he had knocked her over
he felt her now clinging round his legs and his terror reached its culminating point became a sort of intoxication entertained delusions acquired the characteristics of delirium tremens
he positively saw snakes now
he saw the woman twined round him like a snake not to be shaken off
she was not deadly
she was death itselfthe companion of life
mrs verloc as if relieved by the outburst was very far from behaving noisily now
she was pitiful
tom you cant throw me off now she murmured from the floor
not unless you crush my head under your heel
i wont leave you  get up said ossipon
his face was so pale as to be quite visible in the profound black darkness of the shop while mrs verloc veiled had no face almost no discernible form
the trembling of something small and white a flower in her hat marked her place her movements
it rose in the blackness
she had got up from the floor and ossipon regretted not having run out at once into the street
but he perceived easily that it would not do
it would not do
she would run after him
she would pursue him shrieking till she sent every policeman within hearing in chase
and then goodness only knew what she would say of him
he was so frightened that for a moment the insane notion of strangling her in the dark passed through his mind
and he became more frightened than ever
she had him
he saw himself living in abject terror in some obscure hamlet in spain or italy till some fine morning they found him dead too with a knife in his breastlike mr verloc
he sighed deeply
he dared not move
and mrs verloc waited in silence the good pleasure of her saviour deriving comfort from his reflective silence
suddenly he spoke up in an almost natural voice
his reflections had come to an end
lets get out or we will lose the train  where are we going to tom she asked timidly
mrs verloc was no longer a free woman
lets get to paris first the best way we can    go out first and see if the ways clear  she obeyed
her voice came subdued through the cautiously opened door
its all right  ossipon came out
notwithstanding his endeavours to be gentle the cracked bell clattered behind the closed door in the empty shop as if trying in vain to warn the reposing mr verloc of the final departure of his wifeaccompanied by his friend
in the hansom they presently picked up the robust anarchist became explanatory
he was still awfully pale with eyes that seemed to have sunk a whole halfinch into his tense face
but he seemed to have thought of everything with extraordinary method
when we arrive he discoursed in a queer monotonous tone you must go into the station ahead of me as if we did not know each other
i will take the tickets and slip in yours into your hand as i pass you
then you will go into the firstclass ladies waitingroom and sit there till ten minutes before the train starts
then you come out
i will be outside
you go in first on the platform as if you did not know me
there may be eyes watching there that know whats what
alone you are only a woman going off by train
i am known
with me you may be guessed at as mrs verloc running away
do you understand my dear he added with an effort
yes said mrs verloc sitting there against him in the hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows and the fear of death
yes tom  and she added to herself like an awful refrain the drop given was fourteen feet  ossipon not looking at her and with a face like a fresh plaster cast of himself after a wasting illness said bytheby i ought to have the money for the tickets now  mrs verloc undoing some hooks of her bodice while she went on staring ahead beyond the splashboard handed over to him the new pigskin pocketbook
he received it without a word and seemed to plunge it deep somewhere into his very breast
then he slapped his coat on the outside
all this was done without the exchange of a single glance they were like two people looking out for the first sight of a desired goal
it was not till the hansom swung round a corner and towards the bridge that ossipon opened his lips again
do you know how much money there is in that thing he asked as if addressing slowly some hobgoblin sitting between the ears of the horse
no said mrs verloc
he gave it to me
i didnt count
i thought nothing of it at the time
afterwards  she moved her right hand a little
it was so expressive that little movement of that right hand which had struck the deadly blow into a mans heart less than an hour before that ossipon could not repress a shudder
he exaggerated it then purposely and muttered  i am cold
i got chilled through  mrs verloc looked straight ahead at the perspective of her escape
now and then like a sable streamer blown across a road the words the drop given was fourteen feet got in the way of her tense stare
through her black veil the whites of her big eyes gleamed lustrously like the eyes of a masked woman
ossipons rigidity had something businesslike a queer official expression
he was heard again all of a sudden as though he had released a catch in order to speak
look here
do you know whether yourwhether he kept his account at the bank in his own name or in some other name  mrs verloc turned upon him her masked face and the big white gleam of her eyes
other name she said thoughtfully
be exact in what you say ossipon lectured in the swift motion of the hansom
its extremely important
i will explain to you
the bank has the numbers of these notes
if they were paid to him in his own name then when hishis death becomes known the notes may serve to track us since we have no other money
you have no other money on you  she shook her head negatively
none whatever he insisted
a few coppers  it would be dangerous in that case
the money would have then to be dealt specially with
very specially
wed have perhaps to lose more than half the amount in order to get these notes changed in a certain safe place i know of in paris
in the other case i mean if he had his account and got paid out under some other namesay smith for instancethe money is perfectly safe to use
you understand
the bank has no means of knowing that mr verloc and say smith are one and the same person
do you see how important it is that you should make no mistake in answering me
can you answer that query at all
perhaps not
eh  she said composedly  i remember now
he didnt bank in his own name
he told me once that it was on deposit in the name of prozor  you are sure  certain  you dont think the bank had any knowledge of his real name
or anybody in the bank or  she shrugged her shoulders
how can i know
is it likely tom
no
i suppose its not likely
it would have been more comfortable to know   
here we are
get out first and walk straight in
move smartly  he remained behind and paid the cabman out of his own loose silver
the programme traced by his minute foresight was carried out
when mrs verloc with her ticket for st malo in her hand entered the ladies waitingroom comrade ossipon walked into the bar and in seven minutes absorbed three goes of hot brandy and water
trying to drive out a cold he explained to the barmaid with a friendly nod and a grimacing smile
then he came out bringing out from that festive interlude the face of a man who had drunk at the very fountain of sorrow
he raised his eyes to the clock
it was time
he waited
punctual mrs verloc came out with her veil down and all blackblack as commonplace death itself crowned with a few cheap and pale flowers
she passed close to a little group of men who were laughing but whose laughter could have been struck dead by a single word
her walk was indolent but her back was straight and comrade ossipon looked after it in terror before making a start himself
the train was drawn up with hardly anybody about its row of open doors
owing to the time of the year and to the abominable weather there were hardly any passengers
mrs verloc walked slowly along the line of empty compartments till ossipon touched her elbow from behind
in here  she got in and he remained on the platform looking about
she bent forward and in a whisper  what is it tom
is there any danger
wait a moment
theres the guard  she saw him accost the man in uniform
they talked for a while
she heard the guard say very well sir and saw him touch his cap
then ossipon came back saying i told him not to let anybody get into our compartment  she was leaning forward on her seat
you think of everything    youll get me off tom she asked in a gust of anguish lifting her veil brusquely to look at her saviour
she had uncovered a face like adamant
and out of this face the eyes looked on big dry enlarged lightless burnt out like two black holes in the white shining globes
there is no danger he said gazing into them with an earnestness almost rapt which to mrs verloc flying from the gallows seemed to be full of force and tenderness
this devotion deeply moved herand the adamantine face lost the stern rigidity of its terror
comrade ossipon gazed at it as no lover ever gazed at his mistresss face
alexander ossipon anarchist nicknamed the doctor author of a medical and improper pamphlet late lecturer on the social aspects of hygiene to working mens clubs was free from the trammels of conventional moralitybut he submitted to the rule of science
he was scientific and he gazed scientifically at that woman the sister of a degenerate a degenerate herselfof a murdering type
he gazed at her and invoked lombroso as an italian peasant recommends himself to his favourite saint
he gazed scientifically
he gazed at her cheeks at her nose at her eyes at her ears    bad 
 
fatal
mrs verlocs pale lips parting slightly relaxed under his passionately attentive gaze he gazed also at her teeth    not a doubt remained 
  a murdering type   
if comrade ossipon did not recommend his terrified soul to lombroso it was only because on scientific grounds he could not believe that he carried about him such a thing as a soul
but he had in him the scientific spirit which moved him to testify on the platform of a railway station in nervous jerky phrases
he was an extraordinary lad that brother of yours
most interesting to study
a perfect type in a way
perfect  he spoke scientifically in his secret fear
and mrs verloc hearing these words of commendation vouchsafed to her beloved dead swayed forward with a flicker of light in her sombre eyes like a ray of sunshine heralding a tempest of rain
he was that indeed she whispered softly with quivering lips
you took a lot of notice of him tom
i loved you for it  its almost incredible the resemblance there was between you two pursued ossipon giving a voice to his abiding dread and trying to conceal his nervous sickening impatience for the train to start
yes he resembled you  these words were not especially touching or sympathetic
but the fact of that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully
with a little faint cry and throwing her arms out mrs verloc burst into tears at last
ossipon entered the carriage hastily closed the door and looked out to see the time by the station clock
eight minutes more
for the first three of these mrs verloc wept violently and helplessly without pause or interruption
then she recovered somewhat and sobbed gently in an abundant fall of tears
she tried to talk to her saviour to the man who was the messenger of life
oh tom
how could i fear to die after he was taken away from me so cruelly
how could i
how could i be such a coward  she lamented aloud her love of life that life without grace or charm and almost without decency but of an exalted faithfulness of purpose even unto murder
and as often happens in the lament of poor humanity rich in suffering but indigent in words the truththe very cry of truthwas found in a worn and artificial shape picked up somewhere among the phrases of sham sentiment
how could i be so afraid of death
tom i tried
but i am afraid
i tried to do away with myself
and i couldnt
am i hard
i suppose the cup of horrors was not full enough for such as me
then when you came      she paused
then in a gust of confidence and gratitude i will live all my days for you tom she sobbed out
go over into the other corner of the carriage away from the platform said ossipon solicitously
she let her saviour settle her comfortably and he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping still more violent than the first
he watched the symptoms with a sort of medical air as if counting seconds
he heard the guards whistle at last
an involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move
mrs verloc heard and felt nothing and ossipon her saviour stood still
he felt the train roll quicker rumbling heavily to the sound of the womans loud sobs and then crossing the carriage in two long strides he opened the door deliberately and leaped out
he had leaped out at the very end of the platform and such was his determination in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort of miracle performed almost in the air to slam to the door of the carriage
only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a shot rabbit
he was bruised shaken pale as death and out of breath when he got up
but he was calm and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment
he explained in gentle and convincing tones that his wife had started at a moments notice for brittany to her dying mother that of course she was greatly upset and he considerably concerned at her state that he was trying to cheer her up and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out
to the general exclamation why didnt you go on to southampton then sir he objected the inexperience of a young sisterinlaw left alone in the house with three small children and her alarm at his absence the telegraph offices being closed
he had acted on impulse
but i dont think ill ever try that again he concluded smiled all round distributed some small change and marched without a limp out of the station
outside comrade ossipon flush of safe banknotes as never before in his life refused the offer of a cab
i can walk he said with a little friendly laugh to the civil driver
he could walk
he walked
he crossed the bridge
later on the towers of the abbey saw in their massive immobility the yellow bush of his hair passing under the lamps
the lights of victoria saw him too and sloane square and the railings of the park
and comrade ossipon once more found himself on a bridge
the river a sinister marvel of still shadows and flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence arrested his attention
he stood looking over the parapet for a long time
the clock tower boomed a brazen blast above his drooping head
he looked up at the dial    halfpast twelve of a wild night in the channel
and again comrade ossipon walked
his robust form was seen that night in distant parts of the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of mud under a veil of raw mist
it was seen crossing the streets without life and sound or diminishing in the interminable straight perspectives of shadowy houses bordering empty roadways lined by strings of gas lamps
he walked through squares places ovals commons through monotonous streets with unknown names where the dust of humanity settles inert and hopeless out of the stream of life
he walked
and suddenly turning into a strip of a front garden with a mangy grass plot he let himself into a small grimy house with a latchkey he took out of his pocket
he threw himself down on his bed all dressed and lay still for a whole quarter of an hour
then he sat up suddenly drawing up his knees and clasping his legs
the first dawn found him openeyed in that same posture
this man who could walk so long so far so aimlessly without showing a sign of fatigue could also remain sitting still for hours without stirring a limb or an eyelid
but when the late sun sent its rays into the room he unclasped his hands and fell back on the pillow
his eyes stared at the ceiling
and suddenly they closed
comrade ossipon slept in the sunlight
chapter xiii   the enormous iron padlock on the doors of the wall cupboard was the only object in the room on which the eye could rest without becoming afflicted by the miserable unloveliness of forms and the poverty of material
unsaleable in the ordinary course of business on account of its noble proportions it had been ceded to the professor for a few pence by a marine dealer in the east of london
the room was large clean respectable and poor with that poverty suggesting the starvation of every human need except mere bread
there was nothing on the walls but the paper an expanse of arsenical green soiled with indelible smudges here and there and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited continents
at a deal table near a window sat comrade ossipon holding his head between his fists
the professor dressed in his only suit of shoddy tweeds but flapping to and fro on the bare boards a pair of incredibly dilapidated slippers had thrust his hands deep into the overstrained pockets of his jacket
he was relating to his robust guest a visit he had lately been paying to the apostle michaelis
the perfect anarchist had even been unbending a little
the fellow didnt know anything of verlocs death
of course
he never looks at the newspapers
they make him too sad he says
but never mind
i walked into his cottage
not a soul anywhere
i had to shout halfadozen times before he answered me
i thought he was fast asleep yet in bed
but not at all
he had been writing his book for four hours already
he sat in that tiny cage in a litter of manuscript
there was a halfeaten raw carrot on the table near him
his breakfast
he lives on a diet of raw carrots and a little milk now  how does he look on it asked comrade ossipon listlessly
angelic   
i picked up a handful of his pages from the floor
the poverty of reasoning is astonishing
he has no logic
he cant think consecutively
but thats nothing
he has divided his biography into three parts entitledfaith hope charity  he is elaborating now the idea of a world planned out like an immense and nice hospital with gardens and flowers in which the strong are to devote themselves to the nursing of the weak  the professor paused
conceive you this folly ossipon
the weak
the source of all evil on this earth he continued with his grim assurance
i told him that i dreamt of a world like shambles where the weak would be taken in hand for utter extermination  do you understand ossipon
the source of all evil
they are our sinister mastersthe weak the flabby the silly the cowardly the faint of heart and the slavish of mind
they have power
they are the multitude
theirs is the kingdom of the earth
exterminate exterminate
that is the only way of progress
it is
follow me ossipon
first the great multitude of the weak must go then the only relatively strong
you see
first the blind then the deaf and the dumb then the halt and the lameand so on
every taint every vice every prejudice every convention must meet its doom  and what remains asked ossipon in a stifled voice
i remainif i am strong enough asserted the sallow little professor whose large ears thin like membranes and standing far out from the sides of his frail skull took on suddenly a deep red tint
havent i suffered enough from this oppression of the weak he continued forcibly
then tapping the breastpocket of his jacket and yet i am the force he went on
but the time
the time
give me time
ah
that multitude too stupid to feel either pity or fear
sometimes i think they have everything on their side
everythingeven deathmy own weapon  come and drink some beer with me at the silenus said the robust ossipon after an interval of silence pervaded by the rapid flap flap of the slippers on the feet of the perfect anarchist
this last accepted
he was jovial that day in his own peculiar way
he slapped ossipons shoulder
beer
so be it
let us drink and he merry for we are strong and tomorrow we die  he busied himself with putting on his boots and talked meanwhile in his curt resolute tones
whats the matter with you ossipon
you look glum and seek even my company
i hear that you are seen constantly in places where men utter foolish things over glasses of liquor
why
have you abandoned your collection of women
they are the weak who feed the strongeh  he stamped one foot and picked up his other laced boot heavy thicksoled unblacked mended many times
he smiled to himself grimly
tell me ossipon terrible man has ever one of your victims killed herself for youor are your triumphs so far incompletefor blood alone puts a seal on greatness
blood
death
look at history  you be damned said ossipon without turning his head
why
let that be the hope of the weak whose theology has invented hell for the strong
ossipon my feeling for you is amicable contempt
you couldnt kill a fly  but rolling to the feast on the top of the omnibus the professor lost his high spirits
the contemplation of the multitudes thronging the pavements extinguished his assurance under a load of doubt and uneasiness which he could only shake off after a period of seclusion in the room with the large cupboard closed by an enormous padlock
and so said over his shoulder comrade ossipon who sat on the seat behind
and so michaelis dreams of a world like a beautiful and cheery hospital  just so
an immense charity for the healing of the weak assented the professor sardonically
thats silly admitted ossipon
you cant heal weakness
but after all michaelis may not be so far wrong
in two hundred years doctors will rule the world
science reigns already
it reigns in the shade maybebut it reigns
and all science must culminate at last in the science of healingnot the weak but the strong
mankind wants to liveto live  mankind asserted the professor with a selfconfident glitter of his ironrimmed spectacles does not know what it wants  but you do growled ossipon
just now youve been crying for timetime
well
the doctors will serve you out your timeif you are good
you profess yourself to be one of the strongbecause you carry in your pocket enough stuff to send yourself and say twenty other people into eternity
but eternity is a damned hole
its time that you need
youif you met a man who could give you for certain ten years of time you would call him your master  my device is no god
no master said the professor sententiously as he rose to get off the bus
ossipon followed
wait till you are lying flat on your back at the end of your time he retorted jumping off the footboard after the other
your scurvy shabby mangy little bit of time he continued across the street and hopping on to the curbstone
ossipon i think that you are a humbug the professor said opening masterfully the doors of the renowned silenus
and when they had established themselves at a little table he developed further this gracious thought
you are not even a doctor
but you are funny
your notion of a humanity universally putting out the tongue and taking the pill from pole to pole at the bidding of a few solemn jokers is worthy of the prophet
prophecy
whats the good of thinking of what will be he raised his glass
to the destruction of what is he said calmly
he drank and relapsed into his peculiarly close manner of silence
the thought of a mankind as numerous as the sands of the seashore as indestructible as difficult to handle oppressed him
the sound of exploding bombs was lost in their immensity of passive grains without an echo
for instance this verloc affair
who thought of it now
ossipon as if suddenly compelled by some mysterious force pulled a muchfolded newspaper out of his pocket
the professor raised his head at the rustle
whats that paper
anything in it he asked
ossipon started like a scared somnambulist
nothing
nothing whatever
the things ten days old
i forgot it in my pocket i suppose  but he did not throw the old thing away
before returning it to his pocket he stole a glance at the last lines of a paragraph
they ran thus an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this act of madness or despair  such were the end words of an item of news headed suicide of lady passenger from a crosschannel boat  comrade ossipon was familiar with the beauties of its journalistic style
an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever      he knew every word by heart
an impenetrable mystery      and the robust anarchist hanging his head on his breast fell into a long reverie
he was menaced by this thing in the very sources of his existence
he could not issue forth to meet his various conquests those that he courted on benches in kensington gardens and those he met near area railings without the dread of beginning to talk to them of an impenetrable mystery destined   
he was becoming scientifically afraid of insanity lying in wait for him amongst these lines
to hang for ever over  it was an obsession a torture
he had lately failed to keep several of these appointments whose note used to be an unbounded trustfulness in the language of sentiment and manly tenderness
the confiding disposition of various classes of women satisfied the needs of his selflove and put some material means into his hand
he needed it to live
it was there
but if he could no longer make use of it he ran the risk of starving his ideals and his body 
  this act of madness or despair  an impenetrable mystery was sure to hang for ever as far as all mankind was concerned
but what of that if he alone of all men could never get rid of the cursed knowledge
and comrade ossipons knowledge was as precise as the newspaper man could make itup to the very threshold of the mystery destined to hang for ever
    comrade ossipon was well informed
he knew what the gangway man of the steamer had seen a lady in a black dress and a black veil wandering at midnight alongside on the quay
are you going by the boat maam he had asked her encouragingly
this way  she seemed not to know what to do
he helped her on board
she seemed weak  and he knew also what the stewardess had seen a lady in black with a white face standing in the middle of the empty ladies cabin
the stewardess induced her to lie down there
the lady seemed quite unwilling to speak and as if she were in some awful trouble
the next the stewardess knew she was gone from the ladies cabin
the stewardess then went on deck to look for her and comrade ossipon was informed that the good woman found the unhappy lady lying down in one of the hooded seats
her eyes were open but she would not answer anything that was said to her
she seemed very ill
the stewardess fetched the chief steward and those two people stood by the side of the hooded seat consulting over their extraordinary and tragic passenger
they talked in audible whispers for she seemed past hearing of st malo and the consul there of communicating with her people in england
then they went away to arrange for her removal down below for indeed by what they could see of her face she seemed to them to be dying
but comrade ossipon knew that behind that white mask of despair there was struggling against terror and despair a vigour of vitality a love of life that could resist the furious anguish which drives to murder and the fear the blind mad fear of the gallows
he knew
but the stewardess and the chief steward knew nothing except that when they came back for her in less than five minutes the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat
she was nowhere
she was gone
it was then five oclock in the morning and it was no accident either
an hour afterwards one of the steamers hands found a wedding ring left lying on the seat
it had stuck to the wood in a bit of wet and its glitter caught the mans eye
there was a date th june  engraved inside
an impenetrable mystery is destined to hang for ever      and comrade ossipon raised his bowed head beloved of various humble women of these isles apollolike in the sunniness of its bush of hair
the professor had grown restless meantime
he rose
stay said ossipon hurriedly
here what do you know of madness and despair  the professor passed the tip of his tongue on his dry thin lips and said doctorally  there are no such things
all passion is lost now
the world is mediocre limp without force
and madness and despair are a force
and force is a crime in the eyes of the fools the weak and the silly who rule the roost
you are mediocre
verloc whose affair the police has managed to smother so nicely was mediocre
and the police murdered him
he was mediocre
everybody is mediocre
madness and despair
give me that for a lever and ill move the world
ossipon you have my cordial scorn
you are incapable of conceiving even what the fatfed citizen would call a crime
you have no force  he paused smiling sardonically under the fierce glitter of his thick glasses
and let me tell you that this little legacy they say youve come into has not improved your intelligence
you sit at your beer like a dummy
goodbye  will you have it said ossipon looking up with an idiotic grin
have what  the legacy
all of it  the incorruptible professor only smiled
his clothes were all but falling off him his boots shapeless with repairs heavy like lead let water in at every step
he said  i will send you byandby a small bill for certain chemicals which i shall order tomorrow
i need them badly
understoodeh  ossipon lowered his head slowly
he was alone
an impenetrable mystery      it seemed to him that suspended in the air before him he saw his own brain pulsating to the rhythm of an impenetrable mystery
it was diseased clearly     this act of madness or despair  the mechanical piano near the door played through a valse cheekily then fell silent all at once as if gone grumpy
comrade ossipon nicknamed the doctor went out of the silenus beerhall
at the door he hesitated blinking at a not too splendid sunlightand the paper with the report of the suicide of a lady was in his pocket
his heart was beating against it
the suicide of a ladythis act of madness or despair
he walked along the street without looking where he put his feet and he walked in a direction which would not bring him to the place of appointment with another lady an elderly nursery governess putting her trust in an apollolike ambrosial head
he was walking away from it
he could face no woman
it was ruin
he could neither think work sleep nor eat
but he was beginning to drink with pleasure with anticipation with hope
it was ruin
his revolutionary career sustained by the sentiment and trustfulness of many women was menaced by an impenetrable mysterythe mystery of a human brain pulsating wrongfully to the rhythm of journalistic phrases
 
  will hang for ever over this act   
it was inclining towards the gutter 
  of madness or despair  i am seriously ill he muttered to himself with scientific insight
already his robust form with an embassys secretservice money inherited from mr verloc in his pockets was marching in the gutter as if in training for the task of an inevitable future
already he bowed his broad shoulders his head of ambrosial locks as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the sandwich board
as on that night more than a week ago comrade ossipon walked without looking where he put his feet feeling no fatigue feeling nothing seeing nothing hearing not a sound
an impenetrable mystery
    he walked disregarded     this act of madness or despair  and the incorruptible professor walked too averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind
he had no future
he disdained it
he was a force
his thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction
he walked frail insignificant shabby miserableand terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world
nobody looked at him
he passed on unsuspected and deadly like a pest in the street full of men
