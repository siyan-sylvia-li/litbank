chapter    mrs gildea had settled early to her morning's work in what she called the verandastudy of her cottage in leichardt's town
it was a primitive cottage of the old style standing in a garden and built on the cliffthe emu point sideoverlooking the broad leichardt river
the veranda quite twelve feet wide ranaustralian fashionalong the front of the cottage except for the two closedin ends forming one a bathroom and the other a kind of store closet
being raised a few feet above the ground the veranda was enclosed by a wooden railing and this and the supporting posts were twined with creepers that must have been planted at least thirty years
one of these a stephanotis showed masses of white bloom which joan gildea casually reflected would have fetched a pretty sum in covent garden and joining in with a finegrowing asparagus fern formed an arch over the entrance steps
the end of the veranda where mrs gildea had established herself with her typewriter and paraphernalia of literary work was screened by a thickstemmed grapevine which made a dapple of shadow and sunshine upon the boarded floor
some bunches of late grapesit was the very beginning of marchhung upon the vine and at the other end of the veranda grew a passion creeper its great purple fruit looking like huge plums amidst its vivid green leaves
the roof of the veranda was low with projecting eaves below which a bunch of yellowing bananas hung to ripen
in fact the veranda and garden beyond would have been paradise to a fruitarian
against the wall of the storeroom stood a large tin dish piled with melons pineapples and miscellaneous garden produce while between the veranda posts could be seen a guavatree an elderly fig and a loquat all in full bearing
the garden seemed a tangle of all manner of vegetationan oleander in bloom a poinsettia a yucca lifting its spike of waxen white blossoms a narrow flowerborder in which the gardenias had become tall shrubs and the scented verbena shrubs almost trees
as for the blend of perfume it was dreamily intoxicating
two bamboos guarding the side entrance gate made a soft whispering that heightened the dreamsense
the bottom of the garden looked an inchoate mass of greenery topped by the upper boughs of tall straggling gum trees growing outside where the ground fell gradually to the river
from where mrs gildea sat she had a view of almost the whole reach of the river where it circles emu point
for as is known to all who know leichardt's town the river winds in two great loops girdling two low points so that in striking a beeline across the whole town business and residential one must cross the river three times
mrs gildea could see the plan of the main street in the middle point and the roofs of shops and offices
the busy wharves of the leichardt's land steam navigation companyfamiliarly the llsn
colay opposite on her right while leftward across the water she could trace as far as the grapevine would allow the boundary of the botanical gardens and get a sight of the white stone and grey slate end of the big parliamentary buildings
the heathaze over the town and the brilliant sunsparkles on the river suggested a cruel glare outside the shady veranda and overgrown old garden
a pleasant study if a bit distracting from its plenitude of associations to australianborn joan gildea who on her marriage had been transplanted into english soil as carefree as a rose cut from the parent stem and who now after nearly twenty years had returned to the scene of her youtha widow a working journalist and shorn of most of her early illusions
her typewriter stood on a bamboo table before her
a pile of australian hansards for reference sat on a chair at convenient distance
a large table with a green cloth at her elbow had at one end a tray with the remains of her breakfast of tea scones and fruit
the end nearest her was littered with sheaves of manuscript newspapercuttings photographs and sepia sketchesobviously for purposes of illustration gumbottle stylographs and the rest with also several notebooks held open by bananas recently plucked from the ripening bunch to serve as paperweights
she had meant to be very busy that morning
there was her weekly letter for the imperialist to send off by tomorrow's mail and moreover she had to digest the reasons of the eminent journal for returning to her an article that had not met with the editor's approvalthe great gibbs a potent newspaperfactor in the british policy of the day
it had been an immense honour when mr gibbs had chosen joan gildea from amongst his staff for a roving commission to report upon the political financial economic and social aspects of australia and upon imperial interests generally as represented in various sideshows on her route
but it happened that she was now suffering from a change at the last moment in that routea substitution of the commplace p  o for the more exciting canadian pacific mr gibbs having suddenly decided that imperialism in australia demanded his special correspondent's immediate attention
for this story dates back to the time when mr joseph chamberlain was in office when imperialism free trade and yellow labour were the catch words of a party and before the great australian commonwealth had become an historical fact
the imperialist's special correspondent looked worried
she was wondering whether the english mail expected today would bring her troublesome editorial instructions
she examined some of the photographs and drawings with a dissatisfied air
a running inarticulate commentary might have been put into words like this  'no good 
i can manage the letterpress all right once i get the hang of things
but when it comes to illustrations i can't make even a gumtree look as if it was growing  and gibbs hates having amateur snapshots to work up  hopeless to try for a local artist
i wonder if colin mckeith could give me an idea why to goodness didn't biddy join me

if she'd only had the decency to let me know in time why she couldn't money i supposeor a man
 well i'll write and tell her never to expect a literary legup from me again'  mrs gildea pulled the sheet she had been typing out of the machine inserted another altered the notch to single spacing and rattled off at top speed till the page was covered
the she appended her signature and wrote this address    to the lady bridget o'hara   care of eliza countess of gaverick   upper brook street london w  on an envelope into which she slipped her lettera letter never to be sent
a snap of the gate between the bamboos added a metallic note to the tree's reedy whimperings and the postman tramped along the short garden path and up the veranda steps
'morning mrs gildea  a heavy mail for you'
he planked down the usual editorial packettwo or three rolls of proofs a collection of newspapers a bulky parcel of private correspondence sent on by the porter of mrs gildea's london flat some local letters and finally two square envelopes with the remark as he turned away on his round
'my word
mrs gildea those letters seem to have done a bit of globetrotting on their own don't they'
for the envelopes were covered with directions some in japanese and chinese hieroglyphics some in official red ink from various postoffices a few with the distinctive markings of british legations and government houses where the special correspondent should have stayed but did notonly her own name showing through the obliterations and a final readdressing by the bank of leichardt's land
mrs gildea recognised the impulsive untidy but characteristic handwriting of lady bridget o'hara
'from biddy at last'
she exclaimed tore the flap of number one letter paused and laid it aside
'business first'
so she went carefully through the editorial communication
mr gibbs was not quite so tiresome as she had feared he would be
after him the packet from her london flat was inspected and its contents laid aside for future perusal
next she tackled the local letters
one was embossed with the bank of leichardt's land stamp and contained a cablegram originally despatched from rome which had been received at vancouver and thence had pursued herfirst along the route originally designed afterwards with zigzagging retrogression and much delay along the one she had taken
that it had reached her at all said a good deal for mrs gildea's fame as a freely paragraphed newspaper correspondent
the telegram was phrased thus  sorry impossible no funds other reasons writing biddy  mrs gildea's illuminative 'h'm'
implied that her two inductions had been correct
no fundsand other reasonsmeaninga man
she scented instantly another of biddy's tempestuous loveaffairs
had it been merely a question of lack of money with inclination goading she felt pretty certain that lady bridget would have contrived to beg borrow or stealon a hazardous promissory note after the happygolucky financial morals of that section of society to which by birth she belonged
or failing these means that she would have threatened some mad enterprise and so have frightened her aunt eliza countess of gaverick into writing a cheque for three figures
of course less would have been of no account
mrs gildea opened the two envelopes and sorted the pages in order of their dates
the first had the address of a house in south belgravia where lived sir luke tallant of the colonial office and rosamond his wifedistant connections of the gavericks
lady bridget's letters were typewritten most carelessly with the mistakes corrected down the margin of the flimsy sheets in the manner of author's proofthe whole appearance of them suggesting literary 'copy'
likewise the slapdash epistolary style of the ms which had a certain vividness of its own
chapter    'dearest joan  you'll have got my wire
vancouver was right i suppose
i sent it from rome
since then i have been at montreux with chris and molly and since i came back to england with them i've been in too chaotic a state of mind to write letters
really chris and molly's atmosphere of struggling to keep in the swim on next to nothing a year and of eking out a precarious income by visits to secondrate country houses and cadging on their london friends gets on my nerves to such an extent that luke and rosamond's established colonial office sort of respectability is quite refreshing by contrast
i should have loved the australian trip
your bush sounds perfectly captivating and of course i could do the illustrations you want
besides i'm stonybroke and financially the great god gibbs appeals to me
i'd take my passage straight offone would raise the money somehowif it wasn't forthere
it's out
a man has come and upset the applecart'
mrs gildea gave a funny little laugh
the letter answered her thought
'oh of course
i can hear you sneer
just another of biddy's emotional interestsbound to fizzle out before very long
but this is a good deal more than an emotional interest and i don't think it will fizzle out so quickly
for one thing this man is quite different from all the other men i've ever been interested in
the first moment i saw him i had the queerest sort of arrested sensation
he's told me since that he felt exactly the same about me
kind of lived beforewhen i was a king in babylon and you were a christian slave idea
though i'm quite certain that if i ever was a slave it must have been a pagan and not a christian one
joan the experience was thrilling positively electrifyingglamourpersonal magnetism you couldn't possibly understand unless you knew him
descriptions are so hopeless
i'll leave him to your imagination
by the way molly annoyed me horribly the other day
you know dear she had the audacity to remark he's not of our class and if you married him you'd have to give up us
for could you suppose she went on to say that chris and mamato say nothing of aunt elizawould tolerate an adventurer who tells tall stories about buried treasure and native rebellions and expects one to be amused
our class
oh how i detest the label
and that unspeakably dreadful idea of social sheep and goatsand the unfathomable abyss between suburbia and belgravia
though i frankly own that to me suburbia represents the absolutely impossible
after all one must go right into the wilderness to escape the conditions of that state of life to which you happen to have been born
well that speech of molly's came out of a fascinating account my soldier of fortune gave us of how he stagemanaged a revolution in south america and of an expedition he'd made in the andes on the strength of a local tradition about the incas' hidden gold
i call him my soldier of fortunethough he's not in any known army list because it's what he called himself
likewise a champion of the dispossessed
he has an intense sympathy with the indigenous populations and thinks the british system of conquering and corrupting native races simply a disgrace to civilisation
with all of which sentiments i entirely agree
luke has taken to him immensely chiefly i fancy because he was once private secretary to some administrating rajah in an easternarchipelago or indian island and as luke is hankering after a colonial governorship he wants to scrape up all the information he can about such posts
i answered molly that one may have a violent attraction to a man without in the least wanting to marry him and that relieved her mind a little
as for him the attraction on his part seems equally violent
we do the most shockingly unconventional things together
he tells me that i carry him off his feetthat i've revolutionised his ideas about the nice english girl useless to protest that i'm not an english girl but a hybrid celt
he says that i've wiped off his slate the scheme of life he'd been planning for his latter years
a comfortable existence in englandhis doctor advises him to settle down in a temperate climatean appointment on some city boardrubber shares and that kind of thingyou know it alla red brick house in south kensington and perhaps a little place in the country
he did not fill in the picturebut i did for himwith the charmingly domesticated wifewell connected the typical nice english girl heiress of a comfortable fortune to supplement his own which he candidly admitted needs supplementing
of course he's not a mere vulgar fortunehunter
he must be genuinely in love with the nice english girl
and that's where i upset his applecart
in fact we are both in an impasse
i'm not eligible for his post and i shouldn't want it if i were
to my mind marriage is only conceivable with a barbarian or a millionaire
from the sordid atmosphere of english conjugality upon an income of anything less than an assured  pounds a year good lord deliver me
and you know my reasons for adding another clause to my litany
good lord deliver me also from further experience of the exciting vicissitudes of a stockjobbing career
then again apart from personal prejudices i am appalled quite simply at the coldblooded marriage traffic that i see going on in london
any crime committed in the name of love is forgivable but to sell a girlsoul and body to the highest bidder is to my mind the unpardonable sin against the holy ghost
frankly i'm petrified with amazement at the way in which mothers hurl their daughters at the head of any man who will make a good settlement
there's molly's sistershe chases the game till she has corralled it and once inside her walls the unfortunate prey hasn't swallowed his first cup of tea before she has wedded him in imagination to one of her girlshow do you like mr chose
like him
what is there to like
he's the same as all the rest of the men and they're as like as a box of ninepins  but what do you think of him
but really there's nothing to think  but don't you think he'd do for hester
etcetera etcetera
she has just married the one before hester to what she calls the perfect type of an english country gentlemanmeaning that he owns an historical castle in scotland a coal mine in wales and a mansion in park lane
heavens
i'd rather follow the fortunes of a nihilist and be sent to siberia or drive wild cattle and fight wild blacks with one of your bush cowboys than i'd marry the perfect type of an english country gentleman
give me something realanything but the semidetached indifference of most of the couples one knows
no
my man must be strong enough to carry me off my feet and to break down all the conventions of our class
then i'd cheerfully tramp through the forest beside him if it came to that or cook his dinner in front of our wigwam
now if my soldier of fortune were to ask me to climb the andes with him in search of that buried treasure
but he won't andi confess it joani'm in mortal terror of his insisting upon my entering the sphere of stockjobbing respectability instead and of my being weak enough to consent
but we haven't got anywhere near that yet
so far i'm justlivingtrying to make up my mind what it is that i want most
do you know that since my violent attraction to himor whatever you like to call itall sorts of odd bits of revelation have come to me as to the things that really matter
for one thing i'm pretty certain that the ultimate end of being is beauty and that love means beauty and beauty means love
the immediate result of this discovery is that i'm buying clothes with a reckless disregard of the state of my banking account
i begin to understand and to sympathise with that pathetic striving after beauty which one sees in the tawdry finery and exaggerated hairdressing of a kitchenmaidrosamond tallant has one who is wonderful to behold as she mounts the area steps on her sundays out
formerly i should have been horrified at that kitchenmaid
now i have quite a fellowfeeling with her piteous attempts to make herself attractive to her young man the grocer's boy or the underfootman i suppose
am i not at this very moment sitting with complexion cream daubed on my face in order that i may appear more attractive to my young man
i know now how molly's maidwho is keeping company with luke's butlerfeels when we all dine early for a theatre and josephine gets an evening out at the earl's court exhibition with her gentleman
sounds beastly vulgar doesn't it
but that's just what i'm making myself pretty fordinner there this evening at the french restaurant with my gentleman
it's quite proper we are a party of fourthe other two i may add are not in rosamond's or molly's set
i've been interruptedhe has telephoned
the other pair have disappointed us
will i defy conventions and dine with him alone
of course i will'
chapter    the particular sheet ended at this point
mrs gildea laid it down upon the earlier ones and took another from the little pile which she had spread in sequence for perusal
she smiled to herself in mournful amusement
for she scarcely questioned the probability that her friend would in due course become disillusioned of a very ordinary individualhe certainly sounded a little like an adventurerwho for some occult reason had been idealised by this greatsouled wayward and utterly foolish creature
how many shattered idols had not lady bridget picked up from beneath their overturned pedestals and consigned to memory's dustbin
on how many pyres had not that oftwidowed soul committed suttee to be resurrected at the next freak of destiny
and yet with it all there was something strangely elusive curiously virginal about lady bridget
she had been in love so often nevertheless she had never loved
joan gildea perfectly realised the distinction
biddy had been as much and more in love with ideas as with persons
art literature higher thought nature philanthrophy mysticismshe spelled everything with a capital letterplatonic passionthe last most dangerous and most recurrent
as soon as one emotional interest burned out another rose from the ashes
and while they lasted she never counted the cost of these emotional interests
but then she was an o'hara and all the o'haras that had been were recklessly extravagant squandering alike their feelings and their money
there wasn't a member of the house of gaverick decently well to do excepting indeed eliza countess of gaverick
she had been a glasgow heiress and only belonged to the aristocracy by right of marriage with bridget's uncle the late lord gaverick who on the death of his brother about the time bridget was grown up had succeeded to the earldom but not to the estate
gaverick castle in the province of connaught which with the unproductive lands appertaining to it had been in the possession of o'haras from time immemorial was sold by bridget's father to pay his debts
his brotherthe heiress' husband who unlike the traditional spendthrift o'haras had accumulated a small fortune in business was able by some lucky chance to buy back the castlepartly with his wife's moneysoon after his accession to the barren honours of the family
his widow inherited the place as well as the rest of her husband's property and could do as she pleased with the whole
thus the present holder of that ancient irish title young charming and poor stemming from a collateral branch lived mainly upon his friends and upon the hope that eliza countess of gaverick might at her death leave him the ancestral home and the wherewithal to maintain it
as for bridget's father the last but one earl of gaverick his career may be summed up as a series of dramatic episodes matrimonial social and financial
his first wife had divorced him
his second wifethe mother of lady bridgethad deserted him for an operatic tenor and had died shortly afterwards
she herself had been an italian singer
lord gaverick did not marry again and mrs gildea had gathered that the less said about his social adventures the better
financially he had subsisted precariously as a company promoter
there had come a final smash and one morning the earl of gaverick had been found dead in his bed an empty medicine bottle by his side
as he had been in the habit of taking chloral the coroner's jury agreed upon the theory of an overdose
yes mrs gildea could quite understand that apart from general views on the marriage question lady bridget o'hara might well shrink from further connection with city finance
chapter    a naughty little gustherald of the subtropical afternoon breeze that comes up the leichardt river from the sea blew about the typed sheets on the table and among them those of lady bridget's letter as mrs gildea laid them down
while she collected the various pages of manuscript that had been displaced and was bundling them together with a banana on each sheaf to keep it safe there came a second snap of the gate and a man's voice hailed her
it was the voice of a man who sang baritone and his accent was an odd combination of the bush drawl grafted on to the mellifluous gaelic from which race he had originated
'any admittance mrs gildea except on business during working hours'
'yes it is working hours colin but you happen to be business because you're just the person i'm wanting to speak to so come along'
'good for me joan' and the man came along clearing the rest of the garden path and the veranda steps in three strides
he gripped mrs gildea's hand
'you're nice and cool up here and you get every bit of wind that's going along the river' he said
'it's a good thing you kept this humpey joana little nest for the bird to fly home to eh'
'yes i'm glad though it seemed a silly piece of sentiment  and as you say i always felt the old bird might want to fly home for a bit some day
well you look cool enough colin'
'this is temperate zone for me after the leura
but it's a hot march because we haven't had a proper rainy season and i'll just stand here and catch the breeze for a minute or two before i sit down'
he balanced himself on the veranda railing took off his broadbrimmed panama hat and mopped his forehead with a silk handkerchief
mrs gildea surveyed him with interested admiration
a big manlargelimbed bonya typical scotcher in thatwith thin flanks a wellset up back and massive shoulders
his face was brownyred all over except where the skin ran white under the hair and there was a ruddier ring round the upper part of the throat
his nose was thin between the eyes broadening lower highbridged and with high cut nostrils showing the sensitive red when he was enragedas not infrequently happened
he had large honest blue eyes intensely blue of the fiery description with a trick of dropping the lids when he was in doubt or consideration
they were expressive eyes as a rule keen and hard but they could soften unexpectedly under the influence of emotion
at other times according to the quality of the emotion they glowed literally like blue flames
he was considered queertempered rather sulky and his face often took on a very unyielding expression
he had thick reddishyellow eyebrows at the base of a slightly receding foreheadwanting in benevolence phrenologists would have said and with the bump of selfesteem considerably developed
his hair was yellow pure and simplethe color of spun silk only coarser and it would have curled at the ends had he not worn it closecropped
his moustache and beard were rather deeper yellow the beard short wellshapedthe cut of colin mckeith's beard was almost his only vanitythere was one other the 'millionare strut' in townand he had the masculine habit of stroking and clasping his beard with his large openfingered handspatulate tips to his digits the practical handfairly well kept though brown and hairy
there were lines in his face and a way of setting his featuresthat a man gets when he has to front straight some cruel facts of human existanceto calculate at a glance the chances of death from a black's spear a lost trail an empty waterbag the horns of a charging bullock or even worse things than these
and such experiences had put a stamp on him and distinguished him from the ordinary ruck of menthese and his undeniable manliness and good looks
he smiled as he glanced amusedly from the littered windblown papers on the table to his hostess' rather troubled face
'well you seem to have a pretty fair show here of what you call copy' he said
mrs gildea met his look with one of frank pleasure
'that's what i want you for'
'what's the job'
he asked
'you ought to know that literary copy is not much in my line
now if it had been yarding the fowls or cleaning up the garden i'd feel more at home as a lady's help'
'colin you take me back to bungroopimwhen it happened to be a slack day for you on the run and when the married couple had levanted and i'd got an incompetent blackgin in the kitchenor when the store wanted tidying and you and i had a good old spree amongst the rubbish'
he laughed at a timehonoured joke
'stick sugarmats and weevilly fourbins and a breeding paddock of tarantulas and centipedes and white lizards to clear out
i was a bush hobbledehoy in those days joan
it's close on twenty years ago'
joan gildea gave a little shudder
'don't remind me how old i am
there's the difference between a man and a woman
my life's behind me yours in front of you'
'i don't know about that joan
i've had my spell of roughing itdroving mining pioneeringhumping bluey along the trackstoneybroke sold up by the bank and only just beginning now to find out what australia's worth'
'that's what i saidyou are just beginning
roughing it has made a splendid man of you colin and who would ever believe that you are four years older than i am
colin you ought to get married'
'the upper leura is no place for the sort of wife i want' he returned shortly
'i don't see that
it isn't as if you were going to stop there always
when you're rich enough you can put on a manager
you've got an enormous piece of pretty good country haven't you'
'one thousand square milesand a lot more to be got for the takingmostly fair cattle pasturenow that we're going in for artesian bores
but it means capital sinking wells three thousand feet and more
it'll be three or four years at least before i can see a trip to europedoing the thing in the way i mean to do it'
'must you go to europe for a wife
aren't australian girls good enough'
'i've always meant to try for the best
you taught me that joan i shall follow your example
you were an australian girl'
mrs gildea's face saddened
'well' was all she said
'you see' he went on and the eyes took their narrow concentrated look and suddenly blazed out as he straightened himself against the veranda post 'i know something of what marriage in the back block means and i've studied womendon't laughi mean theoreticallyfrom books
i've read historyalways managed a couple of volumes or so in my swagnights and nights by the light of a fat lamp and a camp fire
i've studied the women of great timesancient and modernthey're always the sameand i've remarked the type of woman that's got gritcapacity for fine thingsyou understand all that as well as i do joan
look at the women of the french revolution for one instancethe aristocrats you knowwell i've realised that it takes blood and breeding and tradition behind to carry a woman to the block with a sure step and a proud smile ' suddenly he became aware of joan's gaze half surprised wholly interested
he reddened and pulled himself up gruffly
'sentimental rot d'ye call it'
'no colin i believe in all that and so do you'
'blood and breeding and traditionall the grand stuff that's been grown in them on the noblesse oblige principleselfrespect courage dignitythe stuff that gives staying power as well as the fire for making good spunk not that i'd put a pureblood racer to haul up logs for an ironbark fence any more than i'd set out to plant an english lady of that sort to rough it on the leura'
'well why not
do you want your wife to be like a canary in a cage'
'you know i don't hold with gilded cages and spoiling a woman who is there to be your mate
but all the same i shan't look out for my wife until i can afford to give her as good a show as she'd be likely to have if the stopped at home
you see a real woman must be a sportsman in her way of taking life as much as a man and i maintain as a general proposition that it's the english ladyeven one of your sneeredat lady clara vere de vere lot who makes the best front against battle murder and sudden deathif it has to come to that just because' he went on 'though she might have been brought up in a castle and never have done a hand's turn that could be done for her she's still got in her veins the blood of fighting ancestorsmen who were ready to lay down their lives for god and king and country and their women's honourand of women too who'd maybe held the stronghold that had been their husband's reward and kept the flag flying when to fail or flinch meant death or worse why look at your lady nithisdales and your lady russells and your maria theresas'  'and your joan of arcwho was a peasant girland your charlotte corday'  'oh you beat me there and i wasn't intending to fire off a speech anyway and anyway joan its awful cheek to think i could ever get the sort of wife i want but if i can't i won't have one at all
i'll have my money's worth
romanceidealssomething more lifting than beef and mutton and cutting a bigger dash than your neighbour
see'
he broke off with a laugh and the wonderfully vivid light that came into his blue eyes made him look like an ardent youth
'and you a democrat'
jeered mrs gildea
'you a champion of the people's rights you an imperialist in the broadest sense of the term
oh i really must put you into one of my articles as a certain type of modern australian
in fact colin that's what i wanted to talk to you about'
'all right fire away
we'll drop the marriage question'
'to be resumed later'
a quizzical look passed over mrs gildea's mouth and then 'oh what a pity'
she muttered to herself
'what's a pity'
'never mind
the english mail's inas you may see
i'll show you what mr gibbs says
he didn't like my last letter
he says he wants bones and sinews not an artist's lay figure dressed in stage bushman's clothes
there mr mckeith among your other cogitations on the subject of women you may try to realise that the mission of a lady special correspondent is not all'she looked round for a metaphor'muscat grapes and pineapple'
'or cookedup information from heads of departments or gotup shows of agricultural mining and other industries
or trips to the bay to see the model island prison in which our weary criminals rehabilitate their enfeebled systems by cool seabreezes and generous diet
or ministerial picnics to experimental cotton and sugar plantations the size of your garden to prove that all tropical products can be raised to perfection without mentioning the difficulty in a white australia of finding the labour to do it'
'oh don't rub it in colin
i'm only a special reporter and even special reporters can't know everything
now do just sit down and let me ask you questions
and first of all do you want a whiskey peg or a cup of tea or whati've had my late breakfast'
'i'll have a smoke please
been swearing off store baccy now i'm down from the bush
i'm trying hard to smoke cigarettes like one of your english toffs'
he pulled out a copper cigarette case with some hieroglyphical letters and numbers stamped on it which he regarded with a humorous smile
'only cost a shilling but now i've my brand across it looks fine
you know that by the brands act you've got to have a number and two letters on every head of stockmy brand's the mark of the beast  ck
see'
he fixed his cigarette into a new amber mouthpiece made a wry face and began to smoke
'i don't think much of your quality of cigarettes' said mrs gildea
'on the whole i prefer your tobacco'
'all right
give me my pipe any day' and he pitched away the cigarette and produced an ancient pipe which he filled with tobacco from an indiarubber pouch and lighted
'now fire away'
'not for a little bit yet
you must read my rejected article and my official instructions and then you'll have some grasp of the subjects i want information upon
here they aremr gibbs first'
she handed him her editor's letters and pushed a small pile of manuscript towards his elbow
'there
it will take you about a quarter of an hour to digest all that and meanwhile if you don't mind the noise i shall go on typing something i've got to send off by tomorrow's mail'
she settled herself at the typewriter her back partially turned to him
the subject matter of what she was doing took all her attention
she worked hard for about ten minutes hearing subconsciously the rustle of papers under his hand and one or two faint ejaculations and a queer little laugh he gave once or twice as he read
presently he said  'i say there's a mistake here
i've gone through your editor's letters
he's sound i think i can help you to get at what he wants
but these other sheets have got mixed up with something else
i thought at first it was a story you'd given me and i went on reading and got interested and now i see it must have been written by some young woman friend of yours'if it's meant for a letter'
mrs gildea turned with a dismayed exclamation
'good gracious
you don't mean to say that i've given you her letter'
'is it really a letter
do women type letters
it reads to me much more like what the heroine of a novel would be supposed to say than an ordinary everyday girl
if that's a flesh and blood woman i'd like to know her'
mrs gildea took from him the three typed pages he had in his hand
they were certainly part of lady bridget's letteralmost the whole of it for only the end and the beginning ones were missing
in her hurried rearrangement of the windscattered sheets she had put these into the wrong bundle
she ran her eye anxiously over the badlytyped slips which with their marginal corrections and smart allusive jargon of a world entirely removed from colin mckeith's experience might easily have misled him into the belief that he was reading literary 'copy'
of course he knew that joan gildea wrote novels as well as journalistic stuff
he read her thoughts
'you needn't worry
there isn't the least clue to her identityi suppose that's what you're afraid of
not a surname anywherei couldn't have imagined a woman would write like thatgive herself awayas she does
but it's fine all the same
there'd be nothing small about that woman joan
do you know how it ended'
'i don't know yet
but i can guess'
'eh'
he blew out rings of smoke with less than his usual deliberation
'd'ye think she'll marry the chap'
'noshe never does'
'she's a flirt then'
'bid' mrs gildrea swallowed the rest
'she would scorn such a commonplace suggestion
do you remember that novel of hardy's the wellbeloved
she's like the man there who was always in love with the same idealunder different formsuntil he found that he'd made a mistake and then the game began all over again'
mckeith ruminated
'she's like that is she

the fellow is what you'd call a bounder'
he exclaimed suddenly
'so i imagine'
'but she's in love with himshe must be or she wouldn't write like that'
'you don't know her
she can't do anything by halveswhile she's doing it'
'by jove that's what i like
there's a woman who'd never hang on the fence
and her ideas about love and all that it's splendid'
he brooded again a few moments while mrs gildea sorted her papers afresh then he exclaimed  'it strikes me she's one of the sort i was talking about just now'
'well she was born in a castle'
'i guessed it you won't tell me her name'
'how could ii ask you
after you'd read that'
'no
all right
you can trust me not to find out'
'besides she would never do for you'
he laughed quizzically
'well i'm a barbarian and it's possible i may some day be a millionaire
but i'm not such a conceited cad as to imagine a woman like that would ever fall in love with me'
his voice sank almost to a reverential tone
'the only thing i do know is that if i got the chance i'd show her i was strong enough to carry her off to my wigwam and she could do what she pleased afterwards
i'd be her slave so long as she cared for meand i'd never live with a woman who didn't'
'my dear colin you're not likely to get the chance
please forget that you ever read that letter'
'no i can't do that but as she's in london and we're over here it's not much odds anyway
well have you found the right sheets
give them to me if you have and then we can come to business'
chapter    colin mckeith had been gone some time and mrs gildea primed with fresh ideas had finished her article on the lines he suggested before she again tackled lady bridget's loveaffair
the second letter there is no need to reproduce the page of daring sentiment that closed the first was dated from castle gaverick in south connemara and plunged straight into the tragic culmination
'it's all over joanwas over soon after my last letter but i've been too wretched ever since to write
if you had been in england you might have read in one of last week's morning post's that a marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between mr willoughby maule formerly confidential adviser to his highness the rajah of kasalporeand evelyn mary only daughter of the late john bagallay esq and the late mrs bagally of bagallay court birmingham
rosamond tells me that luke told her that evelyn mary has been throwing herself at will's head ever since they met last year on a p  o steamer between singapore and colombo
she and her chaperon went on a tour round the world it seems just before evelyn mary came of age
i wonder they did not get engaged then and can only concludeas there was no me then to upset the applecartthat he did not know how rich she was going to be
anyway i feel certain that it was evelyn mary who was at the back of his plan for settling down as a respectable stockjobber
molly gaverickwho is a catsaid she knew for certain willoughby maule came to england with the fixed intention of marrying for birth and position or for money and that he fancied in me he'd found bothshe says that he took his impressions of us from the paragraphs in the society papers and thought us much richer an bigger than we are and that now he knows better he thinks it safer to drop birth and make sure of money
the bagallays made theirs in nails
last year evelyn mary came into a fortune of a quarter of a million
i'm told that it's absolutely at her own disposal
she was an only child
a quarter of a million would be an immense temptation to a poor and ambitious man
and yet joan i can't believe that will has been actuated by wholly sordid motives
he may be an adventurer but he is not a mean one
rosamond tallant thinks it much more likely that because i didn't introduce him to aunt eliza and chris and molly never asked him to dinner he got the idea that i considered him good enough to amuse myself with but not good enough for serious consideration as a husband
and it's quite true that i always shirked that point when it was touched upon
if i must be perfectly honest with myself i think i was afraid of his putting me at the cannon's mouth and telling me i must decide then and there to take him or leave him
should i ever have had the strength to give him up
he's so frightfully dear to me that i can't think of him now without a shudder at the thought of his belonging to another woman
i never really believed it would come to that
he once or twice hinted that there was a girlthe nice english girl that i had chaffed him about
i had an idea that it was his way of putting pressure on me
the first time was the evening that i dined alone with him at the exhibition
heavens
i grow hot this moment thinking that he may have supposed i was in the habit of dining alone with men in french restaurants at popular exhibitions
i don't know why i did for this man what i'd never done for any other partly i fancy because it never dawned upon me that he could misunderstand me
rosamond says i idealised him too much and that he's just the ordinary man and not the tiniest bit of the bayard i imagined him
i daresay she's right and that he may have laughed in his sleeve at my romantic rhapsodies
all the same i never can convince myself that he is a mere fortunehunter
perhaps the very fact that i didn't make the smallest effort to wrest him from mademoiselle croesus when he tried to make me jealous seemed proof to him that he was no more to me than a caprice
so when we made each other an atrocious scene and i told him to go off to her he simply took me at my word
the scene began with my telling him about my sort of engagement to aubrey blainewhom as you know i was really nearer to marrying than i have been to marrying anybody
and yet as i tried to explain to will i didn't want to marry aubrey
only the mischief with me is always that i can't hold back with one hand and give with the other will wasn't able to enter into my feelings about that affair in the very least or to understand how when it came to the point i realised that i couldn't sink to domesticity on seven hundred a year
fancy taking a house in pimlico or west kensington or one of those horrible places with a man to whom you have a violent attraction and consulting with your adored as to whether you could run to three maids and a tweeny
the sordidness of it would be too disenchanting
when i said something like that to will he flared up and we hurled nasty speeches at each other and finally he walked off slamming the doori used to hear that slam in my dreams sometimesor it may have been luke coming in latethe tallants' hall door makes a particularly kismetish bang
that was our real parting though it wasn't the last
he wrote to mea bitter sort of farewell
and i did a mad thing
i went to see him in his rooms
but when i got there his mannersomething he said which offended meone can't explain the unexplainablestarted the scene all over again
it was as if a mocking demon came up between us
that time it was i who left him
the next thing i heard was that he and mademoiselle croesus were engaged
i wrote to himi know it wasn't the proper sort of letteri daresay he saw through my pretended indifference
he sent me back my letters as i had asked him to dowrote me in quite the right strainsaid he was not worthy of methat i'd shewn him i was far above himthat he might not presume to think i could be happy with a man of his inadequate means and positionthat he could never forget meand so onbut that it was best as it is
and now i've got to get what consolation i can out of my own inner convictionthat it is best as it is and that i ought to be thankful for being still bridget o'hara mistress of my own fate and free yet to sport aboutsportoh the irony of itin what you call the stormy sea of my emotions
i make over to you the copyright of my sufferings'
the letter broke off abruptly
it was resumed on another sheet six weeks later at gaverick castle
'rosamond tallant has just sent me a writing case i left at their house with these pages in it
i daren't read them over but they'll give you an idea of my state of mind during those last dreadful weeks in london
my nerves are now in a little better condition
since i came here i've set myself resolutely not to think of willthat is not more than i can help there are times when his ghost is extremely active
i'm putting out brainfeelers for i know that i should go to pieces altogether if i didn't throw myself into some new interest
so that i'm trying a system for the development of one's higher faculties that was taught me by a queer old german professor i met at caux last summer who was interested in the odd little secondsight experiences i've had occasionally which i told him about
he made me do exercises in deepbreathing and meditationyou shut yourself up darken your room and concentrate upon a subjectbeauty wisdom friendship were some of the subjects he gave meand you can't think how thrillingly absorbing it was
i worked frightfully hard at it for a bit drinking only distilled water and living on vegetablesyou can do that in switzerland you simply can't in civilised societyand then came rome and the willoughby maule episode
episode
has it come to that
ah joan i have a horrible suspicion that however much i may try to persuade myself i'm concentrating upon some abstract theme i've really all the time been thinking of him
yesterday i took friendship for my study in concentration
you dear thing came up naturally and your image actually kept will away for a clear five seconds
i thought what a help it would be to be with you and afterwards i made the suggestion of an australian trip on literary business to aunt eliza but it was no good
she is deeply engaged just now in driving batches of stuffy relatives in a stuffy broughamluckily there's no room for me in itto still stuffier garden parties
and besides i don't feel that i can take any desperate step of that kind until the irrevocable has been written in destiny's book
will maule is not married yet
well anyhow the meditation on friendship was comparatively successful
wisdom i found beyond me and beauty awakened painful memories
today i mean to concentrate on wealthone of my professor's theories is that if you concentrate regularly on a thing you are bound in the long run to get what you set your mind upon and i do find my position of dependence upon aunt eliza too unspeakably galling
what a monstrous injustice it seems that iwho if i had been born a boy must have been earl of gaverick should be at the mercy of an illtempered miserly old woman who may leave the home of my forefathers to a crossingsweeper if she pleases
i suppose it ought to go to chris but one doesn't feel called upon to arraign fate on behalf of a distant cousin who by rights has no business to be lord gaverick at all
i'm concentrating on art too
every day i do some inspirational painting by the sea shore
i've made some studies of wavefairies for the children's story book we planned to do together
it's quite invigorating to sport about with them in imagination in a greygreen stormy sea out of reach of human banalities
i can feel the cold spray as i paint and the sense of power and rest in the elemental forcesan almost wagnerian feeling of great cosmic realities'
again mrs gildea smiled to herself
how like biddy o'hara
she couldn't be so utterly heartbroken if she was able to practise deep breathing and concentrationwealth friendship arta pretty comprehensive repertoireand to prate on cosmic realities and the wagnerian feeling
but presently the tragic note shrieked again
bridget went on  'i am in a fever of suspense and misery wondering whether will's marriage will come off or if at the last moment it will be broken
he has been obsessing me these last days
he tooi am certain of itdreads the irrevocable and regrets the rupture between us
i dream of him continuallysuch restless tantalising dreams
and yet my mood is so contradictory
if the marriage were broken off and he stood before me free and offered himself  could i bring myself to face our future together with all its depoeticising influences its almost certainty of friction
no
something deep down inside me sayshas always saidit would be a mistake this is not the real thing we are not suited to each other the attraction might even turn to repulsion
imagine the agony of that
life goes on here all dribble waste and freti cannot concentrate i cannot paintthe wavefairies won't playyour bush gobies appeal more to my present humour
i feel a sort of nostalgia for the wildthough my nostalgia is mental and not from any former association
do not be surprised if some day you get a telegram saying that i am coming'

let us end the chapter

your biddy'
chapter    mrs gildea was too busy in the next two or three weeks to trouble herself unduly over lady bridget o'hara's tragic loveaffair
she had to report on the small holders of property in leichardt's land and made a trip for that purpose among the freeselectors in her own old district
the twenty years after letter she wrote about this expedition for the imperialist was one of her best and for that she was greatly indebted to colin mckeith's commentaries
old associations with him had been vividly reawakened by this visit to the home of her youth
she remembered as if it had been yesterday how mckeith a raw youth of eighteen with a horrible tragedy at the back of his young life had been picked up by her father and brought to bungroopim to learn the work of a cattlestation hitherto his experience such as it was had been with sheep in the then unsettled north
joan was herself a girl in short frocks three or four years younger than colin mckeith and with no apparent prospect of ever crossing the 'big fella water' as the ubi blacks called it or of joining the band of bohemian scribblers in london
she remembered how quickly colin had learned his workremembered how the shy selfcontained lad with always that grim memory of his boyhood shaping a vengeful purpose in his mind and making him old for his years had developed the flair of the bush in his hardy scotch constitution
she was compelled to own that he had developed too some of the worst as well as the best of those scotch qualities inherited from his parents expatriated though they had been and from the staunch clansmen behind them
he had the scotch loyalty likewise the scotch tenacity of character which never forgot and very seldom forgave the scotch obstinacy of purpose and opinion the scotch acquisitiveness a tendency too to 'nearness' in matters of small expenditure which combined oddly with a generosity amounting almost to recklessness in large enterprise
it was on the whole not a bad outfit for a pioneer who meant to get on in his world
the beginnings were small but indicative of the trend of his career
he contrived even when he was earning no salary but working only for his 'tucker' to get together a horse or two a cow or two a specially good cattledog or two which last he made the nucleus of a profitable breed
the cows and bullocks he left at bungroopim when the time came for him to push out reclaiming them after they had increased and multiplied in those pleasant pastures like jacob's herds in the fields of laban
not that there was any seven years matrimonial question
there had been no leah
or if joan gildea had ever played the part of rachel in colin mckeith's sentimental dreams those boyish dreams had left no serious mark upon him
he had gone north to a newlyformed station and had there outbushed the bushman in his knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of cattle and sheep and his amazing faculty for spotting country suitable for either
here no doubt his descent from generations of herdsmen had stood him in good stead
he sold his knowledge to rich squatters in the settled districts who employed him to take up new country for them and to manage the hundreds of square miles and the thousands of stock from which they derived the best part of their wealth
but he only managed for other men until he had made enough money of his own to take up and stock new country for himself
in a few years he had acquired a moderatesized herd and established himself with it on the almost unexplored reaches of the upper leura
life on that river never lacked dangerous adventure
mckeith's father had owned a station on the lower leurathe bank took it in payment of their mortgage after the catastrophe occurred
that station had been the scene of one of the most horrible native outrages in the history of australia
the tragedy had set its mark on colin mckeith
left a penniless boy after having worked his way to independent manhood he had made it his purpose to pursue the wild black with relentless animosity
all along the upper leura to the fastnesses at the river's head where his new station stood on the boundaries of civilisation he had gone mercilessly punishing native depredations
he had been put on trial by a humanitarian government for socalled manslaughter of natives and had been acquitted under an administration immediately succeeding it
afterwards he had at the peril of his life made an exploring trip across the base of the northern peninsula of the colony with the intention as he phrased it of 'shaking round a bit'
he 'shook round' to some purpose penetrated to the big bight and got on the tracks of a famous lost explorer
colin mckeith solved the mystery of that explorer's fate and had his revenge on the government which had impeached him by pocketing the reward which it had offered any adventurous pioneer following on the lost explorer's steps
later mckeith was given a mission to explore and develop a certain tract of fertile country between the heads of the leura and the big bightthe particular premier instigating the mission being a farsighted politician who realised that a japanese invasion of the northern coast might eventually interfere very radically with the plan for a white australia
colin mckeith threw into his own scheme of life a trip to japan by way of india and china
he volunteered too for the boer war and did a short term of service with the australian contingent in south africa
he dreamed more and more of becoming an empiremakera sort of australian cecil rhodes
but he was wise enough to realise that all empiremaking cannot be on the rhodesian scale
he realised that his personal fortune must first be secured
without money one can do nothing
cecil rhodes had had the natural wealth of rhodesia at his back
mckeith had set himself the task of opening up the fine country out west which he knew only needed a system of irrigation by artesian bores to defy drought the squatters curse
that object once accomplishedhe gave himself with luck and good seasons five or six yearsthere would be nothing to stop his becoming a patriot and a millionaire
but colin went slowly and cannilyand that was why the leichardt's land government believed in him
he had the reputation of never spending a penny on his private or public ambitions where a halfpenny would serve his purpose and he was known to be a man of deep counsels and sparing of speech
thus no one knew exactly what was his business down south at this time
only the general remark was that colin mckeith had his head screwed on the right way and that some day he would come out on top
but that there was deep down a spring of romance beneath that hard bushman's exterior joan gildea herself a romance writer guessed easily
and her intuition told her that a little thin bore had been made in the direction of that vital spring of romance by his inadvertent reading of lady bridget o'hara's letter
chapter    joan saw that mckeith was extremely anxious to know more about the writer of that letter and the progress of that loveaffair though he had given his word of honour that he would not try to find out her identity
but he put subtle questions to joan about her friends in england and her acquaintance with the higher circles of society in london
once he asked her straight out whether she had heard again from her typewriting correspondent and if the soldier of fortune had proved himself a bounder as they had suspected
'yes' joan answered unguardedly
'i'm thankful to say that he is married to his heiress'
the eager light which suddenly shone in mckeith's eyes startled mrs gildea
'you don't mean to say that you're thinking of her like that'
she exclaimed
'it's no use colin'
'probably not' he answered composedly
'tell me how does she take it'
'deadly seriously
she's practising deepbreathing and concentration to try and drive the man from her thoughts'
'what
oh you mean theosophy and that kind of thing
i went to hear mrs annie besant lecture once and i couldn't make head or tail of it'
'no
you wouldn't
but it was a german professor who taught b no
i will not tell you her name'
'anyway i know that it begins with a b
and i know that she's got one relation called molly and another called chris and a friend whose name is rosamondlikewise that rosamond is the wife of luke by jove'
he stopped short and looked at mrs gildea with sharp enlightenment
they were in the veranda of her cottage and he was seated on the steps smoking his long legs stretched out against one veranda post his broad back against another
'seen the paper this morning'
he asked
'no
if you pass the chronicle office i wish you'd lodge a complaint for me against the vagaries of their distribution department
twice lately i haven't had the paper till the afternoon'
he pulled it from his pocket and leaning across handed it to her
'read the english telegrams' he said
joan stopped cleaning her typewriter and examined the column of latest intelligence
'good gracious
so they've appointed sir luke tallant new governor of leichardt's land'
'lukea coincidence you'll say
no good telling me that
she wrote that luke was hankering after a colonial governorship'
'well he's got it' replied mrs gildea noncommittally
'and if you read the leading article you'll see that the chronicle is justly outraged at so important a post as that of governor of leichardt's land being given to an unknown man who has never served outside the colonial office in london and who doesn't even belong to the noble army of peers'
'that's all nonsense
luke tallant's a friend of chamberlain's a thorough imperialist and a very good man for the post'
'you know him then'
'i know of him'
'from her'
'her
has it come to her
colin if anyone had told me that you would ever be fool enough to fall in love with a woman you've never seen i should have laughed outright
you don't even know what she's like'
'i can see her in my mind's eye as i used to see the women i read about by my camp fire
you'd never believe either what a queer idealistic chap i can be when i'm mooning about the bush
don't you know joan'and his voice got suddenly grave and deeptoned'you ought to for you were a bush girl and you've had menkind out in the back blocksdon't you know that when a man has got to go on day after day week after week year after year fighting devils of loneliness and worsewith nothing to look at except miles and miles of stark staring gum trees and black smelling gidgee and deadfinish scruband never the glimpse of a womannot counting black ginsto remind him he once had a mother and might have a wife
well can't you see that his only chance of not growing into a rotten hatter is to start picturing in his imagination all the beautiful things he's ever seen or read aboutthe sort of ladywife he hopes to have some day and in making such a companion of her that she seems to him as real as the stars and far more real than the gum trees
so as he'll keep saying to her always in his thoughts i'll keep myself sound and wholesome for your sake
i'll never forget that i'm a gentleman so as you won't shrink away from me in horror if ever i've the luck to come across you down here on this earth'
gidgeecolloquial pronunciation of gidia an australian tree
hattera white man who prefers the society of blacks
he stopped fitted another cigarette from the copper case into the holder and before beginning upon it said without looking at mrs gildea  'i wouldn't spout like that to anybody but you joan
my word
though i see by your writing that you've a fair notion of how this cursed grim glorious old bush can play the deuce with a chapbody and brain and soulif he doesn't wear the right kind of talisman to safeguard himself'
'yesi understand
and your talisman colin
what was your picture of the ladywife
describe your ideal and i'll tell you if she is the least bit like it'
mckeith smoked ruminatively for a few moments his eyes narrowed
the lines in his forehead and round his mouth showed plainly
he was gazing out into space far beyond the sunflecked leichardt river and the botanical gardens and the glaring city and the range of distant hills on the horizon
'well' he said at last slowly 'you can laugh at me if you like but i'll tell you how i see her
she is tallgot a presence so that if she's there you'd know it and everybody else would know it no matter how many other women there might be in the place
most big men take to their opposites
now though i'm a big man i've never fancied a snippet of a girl
five foot seven of height is my measure of a woman and a good ten stone in the saddlewhat are you laughing at joan
i'm out there i suppose'
mrs gildea controlled her muscles
'no no not in the least
in fact your description fits the ideal wife perfectly
go on colin
five foot seven and a good ten stone
how is the rest of her
fair or darkher hair nowand her eyes'
'her hairoh it isn't fairnot yellow or noticeable in colourlike those dyed beauties you see about
her hair is dark soft and cloudy looking
and she's got a small head set likelike a lily on its stemand her hair is parted in the middle and coiled smoothly each side and into a sort of greek knot'  'in short she's a cross between the venus of milo and the madonna'
mrs gildea was smiling amusedly
'perhaps something of that sort
dignity and sweetness you knowthose are what i admire in a woman
but not too much of the goddess or of the angel either
i shouldn't want always to have to load up with a pedestal when we shifted camp and the only shrine i'd keep going for her would be in my heart
it's a mate i'm wanting as well as an ideal now you're laughing again'
'no i'm not
i agree with you entirelyand so would she'
'there
you needn't tell me
i shouldn't wonder if i'd got the second sight where she's concerned'
again mrs gildea smiled enigmatically
'i shouldn't wonder colin
but you haven't finished your personal description
what about the colour of her eyes'
'now i don't believe i could say exactly the colour of her eyes any more than of her hair
they're the kind to me that have no colour
soft and melting and sort of mysteriousdeep and clear and with a light far down in them like starlight reflected in a still lagoon
i say joan you remember the old eight mile waterhole on dingo flatmiddle of the patch of flooded gum and sheoakthat the blacks used to say had no bottom to it
her eyes seemed to me a bit like that waterholeno bottom to her possibilities'
'that's true enough' assented mrs gildea
'there's no bottom to her possibilities'
'i could tell it from her letter
she seemed to write flippantly about thingsbut that was just because she hates insincerity and flummery and the world she lives in doesn't satisfy her
why it was as if i read slick through to her soul
that woman would go through anything for a man she really loved'
he had a way of lowering his voice when he spoke of loveas if he felt it a sacred subject and this in him surprised joan
she was discovering a new colin mckeith
she answered softly
'yes
i think she wouldif she really loved him'
'what i haven't been able to make out is whether she did caredoes carefor that chap
you see that would make a difference'
'a difference
how
what do you mean'
'i mean that i don't believe i should feel about her as i do if i wasn't going to meet her
look here joan you've as good as told meand if you hadn't i'd be pretty thickheaded not to have put two and two togetherthat the luke of her letters is sir luke tallant our new governor
well if she was staying with him in london and his wife is a friend of hers why shouldn't she come and stay with them out here'
the idea had already presented itself to mrs gildea but she tried not to show that it had or that there had ever been any question of the sort in bridget's mind
colin had not read the opening sheet of her letter
'i suppose more unlikely things than that have happened' joan said neutrally
'but really colin' she went on with strenuous emphasis 'i can't understand this phase of you
youa hardheaded bushman to be dreaming romantic dreams and falling all of a sudden over head and ears in love withwith a figment of your imaginationjust because you happen to have read by mistake some sentimental outpourings of a woman you know nothing about and who would never forgive me if she knew i'd let you see her letter'
'she won't knowyou have my word of honour that i'll never give you away over that letternot under any circumstances so you can set your mind at rest on that score joan
and as to my falling in love witha figment of my own imagination'he spat the words out savagely'we'll see how far your remark is justified when she does come out and i recognise heras i am convinced i shall do directly i set eyes on her'
mrs gildea burst into rather hysterical laughter which manifestly offended colin mckeith
'we'll drop the subject please' he said stiffly
'and now mrs gildea i'm quite at your service for any information you desire about the big bight country and the probability of a japanese invasion so soon as our future commonwealth comes to crucial loggerheads with the eastern powers on the question of a strictly white australia'
after that colin pointedly abstained from allusion to the ideal wife and to joan gildea's typewritingcorrespondent as he had called her
he was very busy himself at this time in connection with a threatened labour strike that was agitating sheep and cattle owners of the leura district
likewise with a report he had been asked to furnish of a projected telegraph line for the opening of his 'big bight country'
colin mckeith appeared to be deep in the confidence of the leichardt's land executive council and to have taken up his abode for the winter session in the seat of government though he seemed to regard his recent election for a northern constituency as an unimportant episode in a career ultimately consecrated to the elucidation of farreaching imperial problems
joan gildea found him excellent 'copy' and the great gibbs cablegrammed in code approval of her latelytapped source of information
she almost forgot bridget o'hara in her absorption in colonial topics
but three weeks before the expected arrival of the new governor of leichardt's land a cablegram was shot at her from colombo which made her feel that there was no use in setting oneself against destiny
this was the wire    expect me with tallants biddy
she said nothing to colin mckeith about the messagepartly because his movements were erratic and he was a good deal away from leichardt's town just then
thus mrs gildea did not know whether or not he had read the flowery description telegraphed by a melbourne correspondent who interviewed sir luke tallant and his party at that city and wired an ecstatic paragraph about the beautiful lady bridget o'hara who was accompanying her friend and distant relative the honourable lady tallant
anyway mckeith made no references to the newspaper correspondent's rhapsodies when he paid mrs gildea a short visit two or three days before the landing of the new governor
but his very reticence and something in his expression made joan suspect that he was puzzled and excited and would have been glad had she volunteered any information about lady tallant's companion
joan however kept perverse silence
in truth she felt considerably nervous over the prospect
what was going to happen when colin mckeith set eyes on bridget
joan gildea was a simple woman though circumstances had made her a shrewd one and she had all the elementary feminine instincts
she believed in love and in strange affinities and in hidden threads of destinyall of which ideas fitted beautifully on to bridget o'hara's personality but not at all on to that of colin mckeith
chapter    the first dinnerparty given by sir luke and lady tallant at government house included mrs gildea and colin mckeith
these two met in the vestibule as they emerged respectively from the ladies' and gentlemen's cloakroom
both held back to allow certain members of the ministry to enter the drawingroom before them which gave opportunity for an interchange of greetings
'well'
both said at once and the tones in which the monosyllable was uttered and the glances accompanying it held volumes of hidden meaning
'i haven't seen you since the governor arrived' joan went on
'where have you been all these three weeks'
'at alexandra city close on the desert where they bored for water and struck readymade gasthe whole place now is lighted with it
if you like i'll give you material for a firstrate article upon an uncommon phenomenon of nature'
'thank you
i shall be grateful
colin'hesitatingly 'i did think you'd have come and looked after an old friend at the big show in the botanical gardens when the governor made his state entry'
'state entry
good lord
sir luke tallant has got a bit too much red tape and too many airs about him to suit the leichardt'stonians'
'you were there then'
'started for alexandra city that afternoon'
'but you sawcolin did you seethe tallants andtheir party
his face changed it looked positively angry and his jaw under the neatly trimmed sandy beard protruded determinedly
but at that moment a footman came towards them and mrs gildea was handed on to an imposing butler and ushered through a wide palmscreened doorway into the large inner hall which had a gallery round it and the big staircase at one end
joan saw that the room formerly stiffly furnished and used chiefly as a ballroom had been transmogrified with comfortable lounge chairs and sofas beautiful embroideries screens a spinet and many flowers and books into a delightful general sittingroom
it seemed quite fullmostly of official leichardt'stonians
joan looked for the new governor and his wife or at least for lady biddy but none of them had yet put in an appearance
a handsome fairmoustachioed young aidedecamp looking very smart in his evening uniform with white lapels was fluttering round his dinner list in his hand and introducing people who already knew each other
he looked distinctly worried so did the private secretarysallowfaced of a clerkish type and obviously without social qualificationswho was also wandering round and trying ineffectively to do the right thing
the aidedecamp rushed forward to shake hands with joan exclaiming in a relieved undertone  'oh mrs gildea do help me
i believe i've made an awful hash of it all
people out here' he murmured 'ain't used to viceregal etiquette as she is interpreted in ceylonthat was my last post you know
they seem to think his excellency ought to have been standing at the door to receive them instead of their waiting to receive him'
clearly the aidedecamp had failed to please though he looked spruced and his manners were beautiful
the premier of leichardt's land a redfaced gentleman of blunt speech was grumbling audibly to the attorneygeneral
mrs gildea caught snatches of discontent as she passed from one to another
'damned impertinence i call it
a salaried official no better than any of us giving himself royal airs may do in india won't go down in a free country like this'
the aide finished pairing his couples
'mrs gildea you're to go in with the warden of the university
of course you know dr plumtree
literature and learning is an obvious combination but' in a confidential aside 'if you knew the job i've had to find out the right order of precedence
mr mckeith the governor will be so glad to meet you
will you take in lady bridget o'hara
she's not down yet
you see' he explained again to mrs gildea 'we're strictly official tonight and debrett's out of it'
'so am i' put in colin mckeith
'i guess that lady bridget would be better pleased if she wasn't handed over to a rough bushman'
'now there you are quite out of it' laughed the aidedecamp
'lady bridget asked specially to be sent in with you' and at mrs gildea's enquiring smile he explained once more 'sir luke was speaking about mr mckeith said his name had been mentioned at a meeting of the executive yesterday
oh
you're top hole mr mckeith i assure you'
the aide broke off suddenly
there was a rustle of silk on the grand staircasethe slam of a door above the sound of a laugh and the patter of little highheeled shoes on the parquet floor of the gallery
the aide darted to the foot of the staircase and all eyes turned upward
the new governor and his wife came down in slow and stately fashion arminarm sir luke looking very impressive with the ribbon and order of st michael and st george
he was a handsome man cleanshaven but for a heavy dark moustache and carried his dignities with perhaps a little too conscious an air'representative of the throne' seemed written all over him and no greater contrast could be imagined than the new governor presented to his predecessor an elderly impoverished marquis who had the brain of a diplomatist and the manners of a british farmer and who with his homely wife had been immensely popular in leichardt's land
nor a greater contrast than the new governor's wife to the fat kindly old marchioness
lady tallant was a london woman of about fortyfive
she had been excessively pretty but had rather lost her looks after a bad illness and her worst affliction was now a tendency to scragginess cleverly concealed where the chest was no longer visible
obviously artificial outside at any rate lady tallant was as mrs gildea had reason to believe a genuine sort underneath
she had a thin highnosed face of the conventional english aristocratic type a good deal rouged tonight but with natural shadows under the eyes and below the arch of the brows which were toned to correspond with the evidently dyed hair
her dress a paris creation of pale satin and glistening embroidery was draped to hide her thinness and her neck and throat were almost covered with strings of pearls and clusters of clearset diamonds
judging from the way in which the leichardt'stonians stared at her as she came down the stairs it seemed probable that none of them had ever before seen anyone quite like lady tallant
joan gildea's eyes passed quickly from sir luke and lady tallant to a third figure behind them on the halflanding but first she realised in a flashing glance that colin mckeith's gaze had been all the while riveted upon that figure
not in astonishmenta proof to joan that he had seen it beforebut in a kind of unwilling fascination most upsetting to mrs gildea's sense of responsibility in the matter
the visionary woman of the campfire
and she had let colin mckeith believe that bridget o'hara was the embodiment of his idealheight five foot seven at the least weight ten stone or more smoothparted greekcoiled hair a cross between a goddess and a madonnathat was colin's idealgood heavens
what did he now behold
a very little woman
one of the snippets he despised
not an ounce of the traditional dignity about her
lady bridget gave the impression of an oldfashioned precocious child dressed up in a picture frock of soft shining white stuff hanging on a straight slender form and gathered into a girdle at the waist with a wisp of old lace flung carelessly over the slight shoulders
she stood for a moment or two on the half landing then as the aidedecamp murmured in the governor's ear at the foot of the stairs she came close to the bannisters and looked down amusedly at the party in the hall
her face was a little poked forwarda small oval face pale except for the redness of a rather thinlipped mouththe upper lip like a scarlet bowand the brilliance of the eyes deepset under finelydrawn brows and with thick lashes goldenbrown and curling up at the tips
peculiar eyes mrs gildea who knew them well never could decide their exact colour
the nose was a delicate aquiline the chin pointed
an untidy mass of wavy chestnut hair stuck out in uneven puffs and insubordinate curls all round the small head
at this moment mrs gildea remembered a suggestive charm sent to lady bridget by her cousin chris gaverick one christmas of a miniature gold currycomb
it was a vivid brief impression for the girl moved on immediately but joan noticed that colin mckeith had arrested lady bridget's wandering gaze
that was not surprising for his great height and the distinctiveness of his appearance made him more likely than anyone else present to attract her attention
then as she caught sight of joan the interested startled look changed to one of bright recognition the red lips smiled showing dimples at their sensitive corners
'his excellency and lady tallant' said the aidedecamp and bridget seemed hardly able to keep herself in the background while sir luke and his wife advanced to greet the assembled guests
this lady tallant did with quite enchanting courtesy making an apt apology for having kept them waiting which almost mollified the irate premier
bridget came with a swift gliding movement to the side of her friend squeezed her hand and held it while she talked in a soft rapid monotone
'how cool you look
i've never been so hot in my life
and the mosquitoes
rosamond is in despair
she says she really can't afford to lose more flesh
do you see how she has had to make herself up to hide the mosquito bites
luckily i've got a skin that insects don't find palatable'  they had of course met since the landing
joan had paid her formal visit had lunched at government house and was now on intimate terms with the new people
also lady bridget had found her way to the cottage on emu point
she looked round at the different groups and gave a cynical little shrug
'why
it's like everything one had left behind
i might be at a party to the colonial delegates in london for all the difference there is
where's your barbarism joan

i'm pining for a savage existence that's an excessively goodlooking man'her eyebrows indicated colin mckeith'i do hope he is the man i asked for to take me in to dinneri told vereker wells that i wanted a new sensationthat man looks as if he might give it to meno don't tell me there's excitement in uncertainty'
she went on in eager monologue giving no time for replies
'it seems we've put the official backs up
vereker wells was determined to follow indian viceregal precedentsso ridiculousas i told him and as for luke he's got it on the brain that his mission is to uphold the dignity of the british throne
like a nouveau richeterribly afraid of doing the wrong thing and showing every moment that he's new to the great panjandrum part ah so'
 an ejaculatory trick of bridget's
'he is my fate'
captain vereker wells brought up colin who was holding himself stiffly limping just a little as he did when he was nervous and looking very big and strong and masterfullikewise extraordinarily wellgroomed and tailored
'lady bridget o'hara let me present mr colin mckeith'
lady biddy looked up at colin and he looked down at her
'do you think i can possibly reach your arm'
as he held his elbow crooked to about the level of her shoulder
'you know i asked to be sent in with youit was rather bold of me wasn't it
but if i had known how very tall you are'
mr mckeith lowered his arm stooping over her and mrs gildea heard him say in a voice that sounded different somehow from his ordinary deep drawl  'i wonder why i was chosen for this honour'
and bridget's reply  'i'd been told that you were an explorerthat you're a kind of bush cecil rhodesi don't know mr cecil rhodes but i have an adoration for himi wanted to talk to a real bushmani always felt that i should like australian bushmen from joan gildea's description of them and you'  the rest was lost as the groups converged and the long line of couples went forward
chapter    it was not an altogether successful party
the dinner had portentous suggestiveness the leidchardt'stonians were at first rather difficult
sir luke a little too conscious of his responsibilities towards the british throne lady tallant so brilliant as to be bewildering
but except as it concerns lady bridget and mckeith the tallant's first dinnerparty at government house is not of special importance in this story
mrs gildea very well occupied with dr plumtree only caught diagonal glimpses of her two friends a little lower down on the opposite side of the table and in occasional lulls of conversation the musical ring of lady bridget's rapid chatter
colin did not seem to be talking much but every time mrs gildea glanced at him he appeared absorbed in contemplation of the small pointed face and the farouche goldenbrown eyes turned up to him from under the top heavy mass of chestnut hair
lady bridget at any rate had a great deal to say for herself and mrs gildea wondered what was going to come of it all
conversation became more general as champagne flowed and the courses proceeded
sir luke discreetly on the prowl for information attacked antipodean questionsthe blacks for instance
he had observed the small company of natives theatrically got up in the warpaint of former times which grouped round the dais on which he had been received at the state landing had furnished an effective bit of local colour to the pageant
up to what degree of latitude might these semicivilised and he feared demoralised beings be taken as a survival of the indigenous population of leichardt's land
did wild and dangerous blacks still exist up north and in the interior of the colony
'you'd better ask mckeith about that your excellency' said the premier
'he knows more about the blacks up north than any of us'
the governor enquired as to the amenability of the australian native to missionary methods of civilisation and one of the other ministers broke in with a laugh
'bible in one hand and baccy in the other
no sir the exeter hall and general gordon principles aren't workable with our blacks
kindness doesn't do
the early pioneers soon found that out'
lady bridget had stopped suddenly in her talk with colin and was listening her eyes glowering at her companion
'why didn't kindness do'
she asked sharply
'yes mr mckeith tell us why the early pioneers abandoned the gentle method' said the governor
mckeith's face changed it became dark and a dangerous fire blazed in his blue eyes
'because they found that the blacks repaid kindness with ingratitudetreacheryfoul murder' he pulled himself up as though afraid of losing command of himself if he pursued the subject his voice thrilled with some deepseated feeling
mrs gildea who understood the personal application broke in across the table with an apposite remark about her own early experiences of the blacks
lady bridget impatiently addressed mckeith
'go on
what do the blacks do now to you people to make you treat them unkindly'
'what do they do nowto us squatters you mean'
colin had recovered himself
'why they begin by spearing our cattle and then they take to spearing ourselves'
'did they ever spear you'
she asked
colin smiled at her grimly
'well you wouldn't have noticed of course that i've got just a touch of a limpit's only if i'm not in my best form that it shows
i owe that to a spear through my thigh one night that the blacks rushed my camp when i was asleep
and i'd given their gins rations that very morning'
'and then'
lady bridget's voice was tense
'oh thenafter they'd murdered a white man or two the rest of us whitesthere wasn't more than a handful of us at that time up on the leurabanded together and drove them off into the back country
we had a dangerous job with those blacks until king mograbar was shot down'
'king mograbar
how cruelly unjust
it was his country you were stealing'
she accentuated the last word with bitter scorn
'well
if you come to that i suppose captain cook was stealing when he hoisted the british flag in botany bay' said mckeith
'and if he hadn't what about the glorious british record and the march of civilisation'
put in vereker wells
bridget shot a scathing glance at the aidedecamp
'i don't admire your glorious british record i think it's nothing but a record of robbery murder and cruelty beginning with ireland and ending with south africa'
'oh
my deari warn you' said lady tallant bending from her end of the table and addressing the leichardt'stonians generally
'lady bridget is a little englander a proboer a champion of the poor oppressed native
if she had been alive then she'd have wanted to hand india back to the indians after the mutiny and now when she has made cecil rhodes emperor of rhodesia she'll give over all the rest again to the dutch'
bridget responded calmly to the indictment
'yes i wouldif cecil rhodes were to decline the emperorship of all south africawhich i should make his job
but you'd better add on that i'm a socialist too rosamond because i've become one as you know
i think the working man is in a shamefully unjust position and that the capitalists are no better than slavedrivers'
'oh not out here my word'
exclaimed a leichardt'stonian who happened to be one of the old squattocracy
'the landowners and the capitalists are not slavedrivers they are slavedriven
we've got to pay what the trades' union organisers tell usor else go without stockmen or shearers
fact is our labour war is only just beginning and i can tell you sir that before a year is out the socalled bloated capitalist and the sheep and cattle station owner will sing either pretty big or very small'
'i don't think it will be very smallon my station' murmured mckeith
'but it's quite true about the labour war
they're organising as they call it already all along the leura'
the governor asked to have the labour situation explained from the squatters' point of view and for a few minutes mckeith forgot to look at lady bridget
he was on his own ground and knew what he was talking about
'it's this way' he began
'you see though i'm cattleand i'm the furthest squatter out my way
but there are a few sheep stations down the river and there isn't an unlimited supply of either cattlehands or shearers so we've got to look sharp about hiring them
now last year weof course i'm classing myself with the sheepowners for we all stand togetherhired our shearers for seventeen shillings and sixpence a day
then up come the union organisers form a union of the men and say to them you've got to pay ten shillings down to the union and sign a contract that you won't shear under twenty shillings a day
the organiser pockets the ten shillings and makes three pounds a week and his expenses besides so it pays him pretty well
well then the shearers go to the squatters
all right say they we'll shear your sheep but it's going to be twenty shillings instead of seventeen and six
the squatters grumble but they've got to have their sheep shorn and they pay the twenty shillings
next year i'm told the word is to go round that it's to be twentytwo and sixpence
well sir we're to see what's to happen then'
the labour talk lacked local picturesqueness
sir luke preferred the blacks and started the question of danger to white men in the outdistricts
how far had officialdom penetrated into the back blocks
he understood that mr mckeith had explored for the laying of a telegraphline to the big bight
could mr mckeith give him any information about all that
mckeith explained again
he had stopped a week he said at the last outpost of leichardt's land civilisation
the telegraph master there lived in a hut made of sheets of corrugated zinc raised on piles twenty feet high and fortified against the blacks
the entrance to it was masked spearproof and had two men always on guardthere were four men at the post
mckeith told a gruesome story of an assault by the natives and of rifles at work through gunholes in the zinc tower
lady bridget listened in silence
now and then she looked up at mckeith and though her eyes gave forth ominous redbrown sparks they had in them something of the same unwilling fascination joan gildea had noticed in the eyes of colin mckeith
chapter    in the drawing room before the men came in bridget talked to joan gildea
they hadn't yet had as biddy reminded her a regular outpouring
the outpouring it should be stated was always mostly on bridget's side
'when did you start socialism'
mrs gildea asked
'that's something new isn't it'
biddy gave one of her slow smiles in which lips eyes brows what could be seen of them under her towzle of hairall seemed to light up together
'why i've always been a socialistin theory you know
i've always rebelled against the established order of things'
'but latterly' said joan 'i haven't heard anything about your doingsnot since you wrote from castle gaverick afterafter mr willoughby maule's marriage'
the light died out of bridget's face
'ah i'll tell youdo you know rosamond saw themthe willoughby maules before we all left
she met them at shoolbred'sbuying furniture
rosamond said she was dragging after him lookinga bundleand cross and ill and that he seemed intensely bored
poor will'
there was silence bridget's thoughts seemed far away
'but about the socialism'
prompted mrs gildea
'oh well aunt eliza made up her mind suddenly to consult her new doctoraunt eliza's chief excitement is changing her doctors and she grows quite youthful in the process
they say that love and religion are the chief emotional interests of unattached women
i should add on doctors when a woman is growing old
don't you think joan that in that case all three come invariably to the same thing'
'love religion and doctors
as emotional interests do they come to the same thing for elderly women'
repeated mrs gildea as if she were propounding a syllogism
'no certainly not when the elderly woman happens to be a hardworking journalist'
'oh there you have the pulli suggested the idea to rosamond the other day and she gave a true rosamondian answer
they don't come at all to the same thing she said because usually you have to pay your doctor and sometimes your lover pays you
rather smart wasn't it'
'yes but i think you'd better warn lady tallant that the leichardt'stonian ladies are a bit puritanical in their ideas of repartee'
'oh rosamond is clever enough to have found that out already for herself' and the two glanced at lady tallant who seemed to be playing up quite satisfactorily to the female representatives of the ministerial circle
'i suppose you made friends with some socialists when you were in london'
went on mrs gildea
'my dear i would have made friends with beelzebub just them if he would have helped me to escape from myself'
bridget sighed and paused
'but you are getting over it biddythe disappointment about mr maule
you are growing not to care'
'i don't want to grow not to carethough of course now i should prefer to care about someone or something that isn't willoughby maule i feel inside me that my salvation lies in caringin caring intensely
but you wouldn't understand joan
you weren't built that way'
'no' assented mrs gildea doubtfully
'but' went on biddy brightly 'i think sometimes that if one could get to the pitch of feeling nothing matters it would be a way of reaching the letting go stage which one must arrive at before one can even begin to live in the eternal'
there seemed something a little comic in the notion of bridget o'hara living in the eternal and yet mrs gildea realised that there really was a certain stable quality underneath the flashing ever changing temperamental sheath which might perhaps form a base for the verities to rest upon
'beelzebub didn't teach you that' she said
'no quite the contrary
it all came out of my concentration studies and the higher thought centre where i met some most original dearschristian scientists and spiritualistsand then these socialistsnot a bit on the lines of the old fabians and bernard shavians and the rest who used to believe only in matterspecially landed property matterand in parcelling that out among themselves
my friends are for parcelling out what they call the divine intelligence which they say will bring them everything they need for the good of others and incidentally themselves
of course none of them have a penny
but they do contrive to get what they want for other peopleit was a soup kitchen this winter where they fed  starving poor
only when they begin they never have the smallest idea of how it's going to be done'
lady bridget was so absorbed in her subject matter that she did not notice the entrance of the men but mrs gildea saw that colin mckeith was making straight towards them
he halted behind bridget's chair
biddy went on in reply to a question from her friend
'you see they argue this way we don't know they say the how of the simplest things in life we don't know the how of our actual existencehow we move or thinknot even the how of the most ordinary fact in science
we only know that there must be an intelligence who does know and who has forces at command and the power to set them in motion'
'and how do we know that'
asked colin mckeith
bridget turned with a start and looked at him solemnly for a second or two
'you paralyse me you are too big
i can't speak to you when you are standing up
please sit down'
he went to fetch a chair
at the moment lady tallant came up
'biddy will you sing
do for heaven's sake make a sensation
help me out
you know how'
lady bridget had a funny inscrutable little smile and a gleam in her eyes which crinkled up when she was going to say or do something rather naughty
'i'll do my best rosamond
but you don't think it would be a dangerous experiment do you'
lady tallant laughed and told captain vereker wells to take her to the piano
'you know that biddy does a lot of mischief when she sings' said the governor's wife sitting down in lady bridget's vacant place beside mrs gildea
colin mckeith still on the outskirts with his chair stood leaning upon it watching the performer
the piano was in such a position that lady bridget faced him
a vain man might have fancied that she was singing at him and that the byplay of her songthe sudden eyebrightenings the little twists of her mouth the head gestures were for his particular benefit
she was singing one of the neapolitan folksongs which one hears along the shores of the mediterranean beyond marseillesa love song
most people know that particular lovesong
lady bridget gave it with all the tricks and all the verve and whimsical audacity of a born italian singer
well she was italianon one side at least and had inherited the tricks and a certain quality of voice irresistibly catching
and she looked captivating as she sangthe small pointed face within its frame of reddishbrown hair the strange eyes the expressive red lips alive with coquetry
the meneven the old politicians listened and stared quite fascinated
some of the leichardt's town ladiesgood homely wives and mothers who in their early married days of struggle had toiled and cooked and sewed with no time to imagine an aspect of the eternal feminine of which they had never had any experience were perhaps a little shocked perhaps a little regretful
one or two others younger with budding aspirations but provincial in their ideals were filled with wonder and vague envy
a few of them had made the usual trip 'home' landing at naples and journeying to london via monte carlo and paris and these felt they had missed something in that journey which lady bridget was now revealing to them
joan gildea whose profession it was to realise vividly such modes of life as came within her purview felt herself once more in the blue lands girdling the sea of storyit all came back upon hermoonlight nights in naples on the chiaja looking down from her windows on sunny gardens on the riviera and the strolling minstrels in front of the hotel  as for colin mckeith who had never been in the blue land and knew little even of the british isles except for londonchiefly around st paul's school hammersmithand the scotch manse where he had occasionally spent his holidayseven he was transported from the government house drawingroom
where
 not to the realm of visions such as he had seen in the smoke of his camp fire
oh no
he had never dreamed of this kind of enchantment
a fresh impulse seized the singer
she struck a few chords
a familiar lilt sounded
her face and manner changed
she burst into the famous song of carmen
she was carmen
one could almost see the swaying form the seductive flirt of fan
there could be no doubt that had the voice been more powerful lady bridget might have done well on the operatic stage
yet it had a timbre a peculiar devilmaycare passion which produced a very thrilling effect upon her audience
she got up when she had finished in a dead silence and was halfway across the room before the applause burst out
there was a little rush of men towards her
'beats zelie de lussan and runs calve hard' said the premier who had made more than one trip to england and considered himself an authority in the matter
bridget skimmed through the groups of admirers stopping to murmur something to lady tallant who had met her half way then stopped with hands before her like a meek schoolgirl in front of mrs gildea and colin mckeithhe almost the only man who had made no movement towards her
bridget sank into her former seat
'the last time i sang that was at a factory girls' entertainment at poplar' she said 'you should have seen them joan they stood up and tried to sing in chorus and some of them came on to the platform and danced mr mckeith you look at me as if i had been doing something desperately improper
don't you like the music of carmen'
colin was staring at her dazedly
'it seemed to me a kind of witchcraft' he said 'i should think you might go on the stage and make a fortune like melba'
she laughed
'why my voice is a very poor thing
and besides i could never depend upon it'
'everything just how you feel at the time eh'
he said
'you wouldn't care what you did if you had a mind to do it'
'no' she answered
'i shouldn't care in the least what i did if i had a mind to do it'
there was the faintest mimicry of his half scotch half australian accent in her voicea little husky with now and then unsuspected modulations
she looked at him and the gleam in her eyes and her strange smile made him stare at her in a sort of fascination
joan knew those tricks of hers and knew that they boded mischief
she got up at the moment saying that people were going and that she must bid lady tallant goodnight
then the premier's wife came up shyly she wanted to thank lady bridget for her singing
it had been as good as the operathey sometimes had good opera companies in leichardt's town etcetera etcetera
lady bridget made the prettiest curtsey which bewildered the premier's wife and gave her food for speculation as to the manners and customs of the british aristocracy
she had always understood you only curtsied to royalty
but she took it as a great compliment and never said anything but kind words about bridget ever after
colin mckeith escorted mrs gildea to her cab and as they waited in the vestibule obtained from her a few more particulars of lady bridget o'hara's parentage and conditions
but he said not a word implying that he had discovered her identity with the author of the typed letter
'i'll come along tomorrow morning if i can manage it and tell you about alexandra city and the gasbore' he said carelessly as she shut the fly door
joan wondered whether he had caught lady biddy's parting words in the drawing room
'if rosamond doesn't insist on my doing some stuffy exploration with her i'll bring my sketches some time in the morning joan and you can see whether any of them would do for the great god gibbs'
chapter    'and what are you going to do biddy
how long are you going to stay with the tallants'
'until rosamond gets tired of meor i feel no further need of the moral support of the british throne' answered lady bridget lightly
'i'm not sure whether i shall be able to stand luke's jingo attitude in regard to labour and the indigenous populationall the colonial problems in capitals observe
he does take his position so strenuously it's no good my reminding him that even the queen is obliged to respect a constitutional government'
bridget took a cigarette from a gold case with her initials in tiny precious stones across it and handed the case to mrs gildea who shook her head
'still too oldfashioned to smoke
i should have thought you'd have been driven to it here to keep the mosquitoes at a distance  'do you like my case joan
willoughby maule gave it to me' she asked
'you didn't return it then'
'why should i have hurt his feelings
we weren't engaged'
a meditative pause and then suddenly 'evelyn mary doesn't smoke
nice girls don't'
'biddy i shall be sorry for evelyn mary if the maules are to live in london and you go back there againwhich i suppose you will do'
'you needn't suppose for certain that i shall go back'
she savoured her cigarette slowly
'i can't go on with that old life the sort of life one has to lead with aunt eliza and the gavericks and their set
i can't go on pushing and striving and rushing here and there in order to be seen at the right houses and join the hunt after fleeing eligibles'
she gave a bitter little laugh and then her tone changed to that ripple of frivolity in which nevertheless mrs gildea discerned the underbeat of tragedy
'besides even so it's incongruousimpossible
i've come to the conclusion that the only things which make londonas i've known itendurable are unlimited credit at a good dressmakeroh and one of the beautiful new motorcars
you don't mind travelling from dan to beersheba if you can do it in five minutes
but when you've got to catch omnibuses or take the tube dressed in gardenparty finerywell it's all too disproportionate and tiresome'
mrs gildea laughed
'you must remember that i am out of all your fine social businessexcept when i go as a reporter or look on from the upper boxes'
'it's abominable it's stifling' exclaimed lady biddy 'it kills all the best part of one
you know i've tried time after time to strike out on my own individual self but i've always been brought back again by my hopeless hopeless lack of practical knowledge of how to earn a livelihood
the one gift i'd inherited wasn't good enough to be of any useif my mother had only left me the whole of her voice i'd have been an operasinger
but i don't think i could have stood the drudgeryand i should have hated the publicity of it all joan how did you ever manage to make yourself independent'
'by drudging' said mrs gildea dryly
'besides i was born differently
and i was brought up with practical people'
'mr mckeith for instance
he told me about his having been what he called a cattle newchum on your father's station'
'he wasn't exactly a newchum
his father had owned a sheepstation up in the unsettled districts
there was a tragedythe place was sold up when colin was a boy
he wanted to learn how we did things further southand besides he was left without a pennythat's how he came to be with us'
'oh
 anyway he's practical
but it isn't that side of him that appeals to me
he believes in missionsin a sort of way'
mrs gildea laughed uneasily
'so you have discovered the streak of idealism in colin
but'she veered off hastily 'i didn't want to talk about colin mckeith
what i want is to hear about your own state of mind'
'my state of mind
that's chaotic
the fact is i feel in a horrible sort of transition state
it's just as if one were trying to wind a skein backwardstaking up one end and finding a confusion of knots then taking up another and after forcing a few of the knots giving the thing up in despair
one knows the right end is there but how to find it through all that hopeless woolly tangle'
'still you must have learned something about how to wind your skein while you've been working through your various enterprises' said mrs gildea
she took up one of bridget's sketches which were on the table and looked at it thoughtfully
'this is quite charming biddyif only it wasn't too fine for reproduction
the block would cost more than the thing is worth'
biddy made a moue
'oh i know
like me isn't it
impracticable
but i could do you some illustrations
i drew rosamond entertaining the ministerial circle last night and showed it to vereker wells while we were waiting for breakfast
he nearly died with laughing
i couldn't have dared to let luke see it'
'that i can believe
and i should be murdered by the leichardt'stonians if i allowed it to be published
but if you'd come with me through the blue mountains and caricature yourself exploring the jenolan caveslike the lady of quality in the dolomite country i could do something with that'
mrs gildea alluded to their first and only collaboration as author and artist
'yes i might
we'll think about it
and if i did perhaps i could make money enough to keep me out here for a year or two travelling about'
joan gildea looked up in a startled way from the drawing she had been studying and asked with some eagerness  'biddy do you really mean that you are thinking of stopping out here for a year or two'
'i do
i want to shake myself free from the old clogs
i want to be honest with myself and withwith the people who are honest with themselves
i've always envied you joan
your life is real at least
you can put your finger on vital pulse beats
i should like to do as you are doing study and learn from a country that has no traditions but is making itself
i want to breathe nature unadulteratedif i could only reach the reality of her
joan i have the feeling that if one could go right up to the bushfar away from the government house atmosphere and luke tallant's redtapism and the stupid imitation of our english social shamswell i think one might touch a more vital set of heartbeats than the heartbeats of civilization'
'you are off civilization biddy'
'yes i am i've had a horrible time
i was quite reckless and spent far too much on clothes and thingsbut that's not what mattersit's the effect on one's inner self that matters
and now i'm going through the pangs of revulsion and just wondering where i can find anything that's true and satisfying
i believe it may be a kind of birth into a new lifecoming out here you know and all the rest'
she stopped her long golden brown eyes fixed sphinxlike on joan who returned the gaze but did not answer in words
biddy went on 'your work is practicalnot idealistic
i believe the truth of it all is that the idealists haven't built up on a practical basis
there's too much pose
joan i do think it's only the pinch of starvation that knocks down the ridiculous pose of people'
'true enough
your cranks don't get much beyond posethey think they do but they don't'
'even the ones who believe in themselvesand who are in their way truly sincere
joan do you know there were moments at the meetings i went to of those peoplechristian scientists and my spiritual socialists and all those philofactorygirls and tramps and philobeasts and philoblacks and the rest of itmoments when a ghastly wonder would come over me whether if we were all stranded on a desert island with a shortage of food and water it wouldn't be a case of fighting for bare existence and of nature red of tooth and claw'
'true for you lady bridget
i like the way that's put' broke in a voice from the other side of the veranda railing
lady bridget started and looked round a sudden flush rushing upon the ivory paleness of her face
if she had not had her back turned to the garden if she had not left the gate open behind her and if the wind in the bamboos had not then made a noisy rustling she would have seen the visitor or heard his steps on the gravel path
or if she had not been so absorbed in her subject and her cigarette she might have noticed that mrs gildea had looked up quickly a minute before and given a mute signal to the intruder not to interrupt the conversation untowardly
chapter    lady bridget recovered herself as colin mckeith mounted the steps and made the two ladies a rather selfconscious salute
'i suppose you know that's a quotation' she said
'weren't you a bit out'
he answered and repeated the phrase
'excuse my correcting you'
bridget shrugged
'thank you
but i always thought men of action weren't great readers
how did you do your reading'
'some dayif you care to heari'll tell you'
she looked at him interestedly
'yes i should care to hear'
'not now' put in mrs gildea
'you've come this morning to tell us about the gasbore at alexandra city and as it's got to go into my next letter i shall take some notes
do look for a comfortable chair colin and you may smoke if you want to'
'this is good enough' and he settled himself after his own fashion at lady bridget's feet with his back against the veranda post and his long legs sprawling over the steps
lady bridget leaned out of the depths of her deep canvas chair and offered him her cigarette case
he eyed it in amused criticismthe dull gold of the case and the initials in diamonds sapphires and rubies set diagonally across it
'your writing'
again the faint pink rose in her paleness
'no it's the writing of the person who gave it to me'
'was it a man'
he asked bluntly
bridget looked at him with slight haughtiness
'really mr mckeith i think you areinquisitive'
'yes i am
and i've bush mannersnot up to your form
please excuse my impertinence'
'i don't mind bush manners
they'rerather refreshing sometimes
but'again extending and then halfwithdrawing her offering hand
'you'd despise my cigarettes'
he made an eager movement
'no i shouldn't
choose me one won't youtwoif i may have one to keep'
'why to keep'
she selected two of the dainty goldtipped cigarettes and he received them almost as if they had been sacred symbols
one he placed carefully notwithstanding her laughing protest in a lettercase which he carried in an inner pocket
she tilted her face forward for him to light the other cigarette at hers and he did so always with that suggestion of reverence which sat so oddly upon him
mrs gildea watching the pair was immensely struck by it
he smoked in silence for a few moments his eyes still apparently fascinated by the glittering initials on the case which now bridget attached to her chatelaine chain
she threw away the end of her cigarette
'well so you've become the governor's unconstitutional adviser'
she said
'joan do you know that luke tallant kept mr mckeith talking and smoking in the loggia just below my bedroom for hours last night after every one had gonei know because i couldn't get to sleep'
mckeith had all compunction 'i'm downright sorry for that lady bridget
i'd have gone away if i'd only guessed your room was up above'
'oh it didn't matter
i'd lots to think aboutmy own shortcomings and luke's responsibilities'
'he takes themhard' hazarded mckeith
'i hope you gave him good advice' put in mrs gildea
mckeith's lips twisted into a humorous smile
'well i told sir luke that i didn't think he need bother himself just yet awhile over that northern tour of inspection he's talking about'
'he wants to make a kind of royal progress joan through the backblocks' said lady biddy
'it'll mean a bit of stiff riding' said mckeith 'but i've offered to show him round the upper leura anyway and to find him a quiet hack'
'rosamond flatly declines the royal progress' said bridget
'i'm coming instead of her'
'can you ride'
he asked
'can i ridecan any o'hara ride
you needn't find me a quiet hack'
'all right' said mckeith
'but i wouldn't make sure of that by putting you on a buckjumper
it's a bargain then lady bridget'
'a bargainwhat'
'you promise to pay me a visit when the governor makes his trip northwhen he carries out his notion of establishing military patrols and a maxim gun or two to put down tradesunionism and native outrages in the backblocks'
lady bridget looked at him thoughtfully
he had pulled out his tobacco pouch and was filling a wellworn pipe
'you won't mind my pipe will youas you're a smoker yourself
mrs gildea likes it bestand so do i'
lady bridget sniffed his raw tobacco and made a tiny moue
'well if you prefer thatno of course i don't mind
i see' she went on 'that you favour the maxim gun idea mr mckeith
i understand that you're one of the oppressors and you and i wouldn't agree on that point'
mr mckeith returned her look all the hardness in his face softening to an expression of almost tender indulgence
'we'd see about that
i might convert youbut in the backblocks'
'or i might convert you'
he shook his head and then laughed in a shy boyish way
'there's no knowing what might happenbut in the backblocks'
lady bridget leaned forward
'tell me about themtell me about your life in the bush and what makes you hate the blacks'
'what makes me hate the blacks'
he repeated slowly and the soft look on his face changed now to one very dour and grim
'you do hate them don't you
mr mckeith the premier told me something about you last night which simply filled me with horror
if i believed itor unless i knew that what you did had been in honourable warfare i don't think i could bear to speak to you again
now i'm going to ask you if it's true'
'if what is true
lady bridget i'll tell you the truth if you ask me for it about anything i've done
buti warn youugly things happenin the backblocks'
'the premier said that you were the terror of the natives
he told me about a gun you have with a great many notches on the barrel of it and he said that each notch represented a blackfellow that you had killed'
'i never killed a blackfellow except in fair fight or under lawful provocation
many a time one of them has sneaked a spear at me from behind a gum tree and i'd have been done for if i hadn't been keeping a sharp lookout'
'but you were taking their land' lady bridget exclaimed impetuously 'you had come an invader into their territory
what right had you to do that
you were the aggressor
and you can't judge them by the moral laws of civilised humanity
they fought in the only way they understood'
'lady bridget there are moral laws which all humanitycivilised or savage understands
i'm not saying that no white man in the bush has ever violated these laws i'm not saying that the blacks hadn't something on their side
i'm only saying that in my experienceit was the black man and not the white man who was the aggressor
and when you ask me what made me hate the blackswellit isn't a pretty storybut if you like i'll tell it to you some time'
'tell me now' she exclaimed 'oh joan  won't your notes keep'
mrs gildea had got up a sheaf of pencils and a reporter's note book in her hand
'yes for a few minutes
but i've just remembered something i've got to refer to in one of mr gibbs' letters
don't mind me i'll be back presently'
mckeith seemed to take no heed of her departure his eyes were fixed on lady bridget there was in them a light of inward excitement
'please go on' she said 'i want so much to hear'
he thought for a few moments shook the ashes from his pipe and then plunged into his story
'i've got to go back to when i was quite a youngstertaken from schooli went to st paul's in the hammersmith roadjust before i was seventeen
you see before that my father had scraped together his little bit of money and we'd been living in west kensington waiting while he made out what we were all going to do
he wasn't any great shakes my father in the way of birth and fortune
i daresay you guessed that lady bridget'
she tossed her head back impatiently
'oh what does that matter
go on please'
'he'd been a farmer glasgow way'mckeith still pronounced it 'glesca' 'and my mother was a minister's daughter as good a woman and as true a lady as ever breathed
but that's neither here nor there in what turned out a bad business
well we all emigrated out here and after a while my old dad bought a station on the lower leurataken in he was of course over the deal and not realising that it was unsettled country in those days
so the whole family of us started up from the coast to it
he drove my mother and my two sisters just grown up and a woman servantmartyin a double buggy and jerry the bullock driver and me in the dray with him and taught me to drive bullocks
there were stockboys two of them riding along side
'it took us three and a half weeks to reach the station averaging about thirty miles a day and camping out each night
'i'd like you to camp out in the bush sometime lady bridget right away from everythingit'ud be an experience that 'ud live with you all your lifemy word
it's like nothing elselying straight under the southern cross and watching its pointers and one by one the stars coming up above the gum treesand the queer wild smell of the gums and the loneliness of it allnot a sound until the birds begin at dawn but the hophop of the wallabies and the funny noises of opossums and the crying of the curlews and native dogsdingoes we call 'em well there
i won't bother you with all thatthough truly i tell you it's the nearest touch with the infinite i've ever known lord
i remember the first night i camped right in the bushme rolled in my blanket on one side of the fire and leurajim the blackboy on the other
and the wonder of it all coming over me as i lay broad awake thinking of the contrast between london and its teeming millionsand the awful solitude of the bush
i wonder if your blood would have run cold as mine did when the grass rustled under stealthy footsteps and me thinking it was the blacks sneaking usand the relief of hearing three dismal howls and knowing it was dingoes and not blacks'
'i'd have loved it' murmured bridget tensely
'go on please'
'well i've got to come to the tragedy
it began this way through an act of kindness on our journey up
we were going through the bunyabunya country not far from our station when out of the bush there came a black gin with two halfcaste girls she ran up and stopped the buggy and implored my mother's protection for her girls because the blacks wanted to kill and eat them'
'o 
oh'
biddy made a shuddering exclamation
'didn't i say the blacks hadn't everything on their sidei ought to explain though that in our district were large forests of a kind of pinethere's one in this garden' and he pointed to a pyramidal fir tree with spreading branches of small pointed leaves spiked at the ends and with a cone of nuts about the size of a big man's head hanging from one of the branches
'that's the bunyabunya and the nuts are splendid roasted in the ashesif ever that one gets properly ripeit has to be yellow you knowi'll ask joan gildea to let me roast it for you
only it wouldn't be the same thing at all as when it's done in a fire of gum logs the nuts covered with red ashes and then peeled and washed down with quartpot tea'  'quartpot tea
what a lot you'll have to show me ifif i ever come to your station in the backblocks'
'different from your london life eh

your balls and dinners and big shows and coaching meets in hyde park and all the rest of the flummery
different too from your kidglove foxhunts over grass fields and trimmed hedges and puddles of ditchesthe sort of thing you've been accustomed to lady bridget when you've gone out from your castle for a sporting spree'
'a sporting spree'
she laughed with a child's merriment and he joined in the laugh 'it's clear to me mr mckeith that you've never hunted in ireland
and how did you know by the way that i'd lived in a castle'
'i was led to believe that a good many of your kind owned historic castles which your forefathers had won and defended with the sword' he answered a little embarrassed
'that's true enough
but if you could see castle gaverick
my old aunt is always talking of restoring it but she never will and if my cousin chris gaverick ever does come into it he'd rather spend his money in doing something else
but never mind that
i want to hear about the black gin and the halfcaste girls and if your mother saved them from the cannibals  and why the blacks wanted to eat their own kind
dog doesn't eat dogat least so they tell one'
'it's this way
our blacks weren't regular cannibals but in the bunya season they'd all collect in the scrubs and feed on the nuts and nothing else for months
then after a bit they'd get meathungry and there not being many wild animals in australia and only a few cattle in those outlying districts they'd satisfy their cravings by killing and eating some of themselveslubrasyoung girlsby preference and naturally halfcastes as having no particular tribal status for choice'
'halfcastes'
she repeated a little puzzled
'these ones had chinky blood in themdaughters of a chinaman fossicker we're not partial to the chinese in australiaonly we don't eat them we expel themmethods just a bit dissimilar but the principle the same you see
anyway of course we took on the gin and her girls and for about a year didn't have any particular trouble at the station with the blacksthough there was a shepherd speared in one of the outhuts that was his fault however poor devilthe old storybut it don't matter
the trouble came to a head with a black boy called leurajimmy that jerry the bullockdriver brought up with him and left at the station where he went down to the township for store supplieshe took me with himi told you i was learning bullockdriving'  mckeith paused and the dark look came upon his face
'and leurajimmy'
put in bridget
'oh he was a fine big fellowplausible too and could speak pidgin englishhe was never weaned from his tribe and he was a treacherous scoundrel at heart as a precautionary measure my father forbade the blacks to come up to the headstation
but jimmy fell in love with the eldest of the halfcaste girls
she encouraged him at first then took up with one of the stockboys  'it was the bunya season again and the girls' old tribe under their king mograbara devil incarnate in a brutei sent him to hell afterwards with my own hand and never did a better deed'mckeith's brown fists clenched and the fury in his eyes blazed so that he himself looked almost devilish for a moment
his face remained very grim and dour as he proceeded
'jimmy had got to know through the halfcaste girl about our ways and doings and he made a diabolic plot with king mograbar to get the blacks into the house every living soul was murdered surprised in their sleep  my father  my mother  my sisters  god

i can't speak of it'  he got up abruptly jerking his long legs and went to the further end of the veranda where he stood with set features and brows like a red bar below which staring eyes were fixed vacantly upon the avenue of bunya trees in the long walk of the botanical gardens across the river
but they did not see those bunya trees
what they saw was a row of mutilated bodies lying stark along the veranda of that headstation on the leura
bridget was leaning forward in her squatter's chair her fingers grasping the arms of it her face very white and her eyes staring too as though they also beheld the scene of horror
presently mckeith came back pale too but quite composed
'i beg your pardon' he said stiffly
'perhaps i should not have told you'
'it'shorrible
but i'm glad to know
thank you for telling me'
he looked at her wistfully
there was silence for a moment or two
'and you  you  where were you'
she stammered
'me
i was with the drays you know
we got back about noon that day
if we'd been twelve hours sooner
well i suppose i should have been murdered with the rest
the blacks had gone off with their loot we  we buried our dead and then we ran up our best horses and never drew rein for forty miles till we'd got to where a band of the native police were camped and then  we took what vengeance we could
it wasn't complete till a long time afterwards'
he was standing behind bridget's chair his eyes still gazing beyond the river
he did not notice that she leaned back suddenly and her hands fell nervelessly to her lap
he felt a touch on his arm
it was mrs gildea who had come out to the veranda again
'colin' she said 'i want you to go and bring me my typewriter from the parlour
and then you've got to dictate copy about the alexandra city gasbore
please go at once'
he obeyed
mrs gildea bent over lady bridget
'biddy
 you're not faint are you'
lady bridget roused herself and looked up at her friend rather wildly 'no what do you take me for

i said i wanted real things joan  and i've got them'
she laughed a little hysterically
'all right
but we shall give you a taste of real australia that isn't quite so gruesome
that some of the tragedy belongs to the pioneer days
i could tell you things myself that my father has told me

but i won't
mind colin mckeith is no more of a hero than a dozen bush boys i knew when i first knew him
yes put it there colin please and now if biddy doesn't mind we'll proceed to business which is my imperialist letter
i suppose you haven't brought back any snapshots of alexandra city and your wonderful gasbore that mr gibbs could get worked up for his paper'
chapter    that was not the only time lady bridget and mckeith met on mrs gildea's veranda
in fact biddy reminiscent of wild seaexcursions along the shore by castle gaverick developed a passion for what she called tame boating on the leichardt river
she found a suitable skiff in the boathousethe government house grounds sloped to the water's edge and would row herself up and down the river reaches
it was easy to round the point skirt the botanical gardens and crossing above the ferry land below mrs gildea's cottage then climb up the bank and enter by a lower gate to the garden
thus she would often turn up unexpectedly of mornings for a chat with her friend in the veranda study
at this time colin mckeith contracted a similar habit
he showed a still greater interest in mrs gildea's journalistic work and professed a strong desire to enlighten british statesmen through the medium of mr gibbs' admirable paper on certain imperial questions affecting australiathe danger of a japanese invasion in the northern watersthe establishment of a naval base by germany in new guineathe yellow labour problem and so forth
he would intersperse his political dissertation with racy bits of description of life in the bush and would give the points of view of pearl fishers miners loafers officials in outoftheway townships labour reformers sheep and cattle ownersall of which vastly amused lady bridget and was valuable 'copy' typed unscrupulously by mrs gildea
in fact she owed to it much of the success which later attended her journalistic venture
mrs gildea thought at first that the 'copy' would be more easily obtainable in the intervals before and after lady bridget's arrival or on the days when she failed to come
but finding that colin was distinctly at his best as a narrator with biddy for an audience she artfully arranged to take her notes under those conditions
this lasted two or three weeks during which period sir luke and lady tallant conscientiously improved their acquaintance with the new sphere of their labours
they visited hospitals inspected public buildings inaugurated social schemes and to the strains of 'god save the queen' performed many other insignificant public functions from which as often as not their guest lady bridget basely cried off
on one such occasion joan arrayed in her best had patriotically gone forth on a steaming march day to support their excellencies fondly expecting that as arranged lady bridget and colin would meet her
but lady tallant looking distinctly cross accompanied the governor alone
bridget it appeared had come down just as the carriage drove up in her morning frock and garden hat saying that she had a bad headache and meant to spend the afternoon in a hammock by the river bank
as for colin there was no sign of him
but when mrs gildea got home very tired and hot she was made extremely angry by hearing the voices of lady bridget and mckeith in the veranda where they were drinking tea and it seemed holding a confidential conversation
mrs gildea's gorge rose higher
she had to stop a minute to try and recover her temper
here was biddy disburdening herself to colin of her family troubles and shortcomings showing herself and them in the worst light singing small to a man with whom it was highly desirable she should maintain her dignity
instead of that she was deliberately pulling down the barrier of rank and social position which should exist between lady bridget o'hara and the factor's son the outback squattercolin mckeith
biddy was saying 'oh but you're as bad as that sort of person who can't be made to realise that the oldest peerage in ireland counts for nothing in comparison with an oilking's millions and being able to entertain the right set and besides really mr mckeith there's no difference at all between us
you talk such a lot about your grandfather having been a scotch peasant
why
my mother's father was an italian beggarugh
haven't you seen them with their crutches and things on the steps of the churchesand my mother sang in the streets of naples until a kind musician heard her and had her trained to be a opera singer'
'your mother'
'my mother
that's where my carmen comes fromonly that my voice i'm told isn't to be compared with what hers was
but that's not the worst about my mother
not that i blame her
i think that a woman has a perfect right to leave her husband if she has ceased to care for him and that it's far more moral to live with a man you love and can't marry than with a husband you hate'
mrs gildea cut short lady bridget's exposition of her views on morality before mckeith had time to answer
her voice was sharp as she went up the steps and arraigned the pair
'really biddy i do call this too bad of you
may i ask how you and mr mckeith come to be drinking tea together in my veranda'
'sure and it's by accident intoirely' answered biddy with a whimsical look and the touch of the brogue she sometimes put on when a situation became embarrassing
'a prearranged accident'
'no it wasn't joan
as a matteroffact we were the last persons either of us expected to meet'
'honour bright' put in mckeith
'i'd forgotten all about the pineapple products exhibition and i just dropped in at government house to pay my respects after a pleasant dinner two nights agowhat you'd call a visit of digestion'
'and since when colin have you become an observer of social obligations'
jeered mrs gildea
he grinned 'ah
you have me there
anyway i asked for lady bridget and found her down by the boatshed'
'and we thought it would be cooler on the water so he rowed me round the point
it was the most natural thing in the world that we should discover we were thirsty and that we should come up the garden and ask your old woman to give us some tea
don't be a cat joan
you never used to be grudging of your hospitality'
mrs gildea quickly recovered her usual genial demeanour
she poured herself out a cup of tea and remarked that it was refreshing after the pineapple syrups and other concoctions she had as in duty bound sampled at the show
lady bridget rattled along with questions about the function and the behaviour of the government house party
had sir luke been too overpoweringly pompous
was lady tallant really cross
and had vereker wells made any more blunders
and so forth
but she did not enlighten mrs gildea much about her doings with colin mckeith and presently said she must go and make her peace with rosamond
mckeith accompanied hernaturally since he had to row her back to the government house landing
there was something in the manner of the pair that mrs gildea could not understand
of course colin was in lovethat she knew already
but was biddy merely playing with the big primitivesouled bushmanor was it possible that she too could be in love
chapter    the next time biddy came joan tackled matters boldly
'biddy i've had my marching orders
mr gibbs finds leichardt's land a bit stale
i take train to sydney next week and tour the riverina the blue mountains and the country along the railway line to melbourne
are you coming with me'
bridget gave a deprecatory laugh
'i don't know what rosamond would say'
'she'd recognise the necessities of the situation
besides you could come back again'
'i haven't been here a month
and i don't find leichardt's land stale
on the contrary i find it extremely stimulating
no i think the riverina and the blue mountains will keep as far as i'm concerned'
'but i won't keep
mr gibb and the drawings for the imperialist won't keep
the question is whether you want to make some money or not'
'it's the one thing i've wanted to do all my life and have never yet succeeded in doing except when we collaborated in the lady of quality
'here's your chance for a continuation series the lady of quality in the bush
how does that sound'
'rather clumsy and long don't you think
lady bridget in the bush would be more alliterative and catching
only i should be giving myself away'
'i think you're doing that already' said mrs gildea
'how do you mean joan
i don't see it'
'yes you do
look here biddy
colin mckeith isn't mr willoughby maule'
'he's a hundred times better man joan'
'that you needn't tell me and i'm glad you recognise the fact
but from the point of view of the lady of quality would he be a better husband'
'you forget my dear that i'm not the genuine article
i'm nothing but a pinchbeck imitation of the real lady of quality
if his grandfather was a peasant remember that my maternal grandparents were peasants too
i told him so yesterday'
'has it come to that
you go fast biddy
but i warn youcolin mckeith isn't the man to be trifled with
he knows his own mind
the question is whether you know yours'
biddy nodded her head like a chinese mandarin
'two months ago you were wildly in loveor at least from your letters one might have judged sowith another man' said mrs gildea
'nonodon't call that love'
'call it a violent attraction then
i suspect the man could have made you marry him if he had chosen
so far as i can understand you quarrelled because neither of you would face matrimony on what you considered an inadequate income'
'middleclass respectabilityliving in pimlico or further kensington' scoffed biddy
'ordering sprats and plaice for dinner and pretending they're soles and whitebait
perambulators stuffing up the hall paying your own books and having your gown made at home
no thank you
'possum skins and a black's gunyathat's australese for a wigwam isn't itappeal to me infinitely more'
mrs gildea threw up her hands
'biddy you haven't the faintest notion how dull and uncomfortablehow utterly unpoetichow sordid the life of a struggling bushman can be'
'no
you know joan i think that it might be perfectly fascinatingif one really cared for the bushman'
'really cared
have you ever really cared for any man
could you ever really care'
'that's what i've been asking myself
it would have to be someone quite different from all the other men i've likedsomething altogether above the ordinary man to make me really care'
'you said that mr willoughby maule was different from any man you'd ever met
each man you've ever fancied yourself in love with has been different from all the rest'
lady bridget laughed rather uneasily
'how tiresomely exact you are joan
of course they were different
everybody is different from everybody else
and i attract marked types
will was more marked and more attractiveas well as attractedthat's all'
'his attraction doesn't seem to have been as strong as selfinterest any way' said joan with deliberate terseness
the girl's small pale face flushed to deep crimson for a moment
'joan you are cruel
you know that was the sting
and it wouldn't have stung so if i hadn't cared
sometimes i feel the maddest desire to hurt himto pay him out
i never felt like that about any of the othersthe ones i really did almost want to marry
and thenat other times i'd give anything just to have him again as he used to be'
'i'm certain you weren't really in love with him' exclaimed mrs gildea
bridget seemed to be considering
'wasn't ii'm not so sure of that
no' she went on impetuously 'i was not really in love with him
he had a magnetic influence over me as i told you
perhaps i might get a little under it again if he were to appear suddenly without his wifeit turns me sick to think of a married man having a magnetic influence over me
even if there was no wifenow
so when you've idealised a person and can't idealise him any more c'est fini
there's nothing but a ghost to come and make you uncomfortable sometimesand that can't last
besides i've been breathing the strong clear air of your gum trees lately
it's a case of pull devilpull bushman
do you see'
'i see my dear that you're idealising colin mckeith and let me tell you that a bushman is very far removed from the superman
oh colin is a fine enough specimen of a pioneer in a rough country
but his rough life his bush surroundings and all the restwhy he'd jar upon you in a hundred ways if you were alone with him in them
thenhe's not of your orderthough i hate the phrase and i hate the kind of man
all the same biddy you may pretend to despise the men of your own class but i fancy that after a spell of roughing it with colin on the upper leura you'd hanker after something in them that colin hasn't and never will have and then' joan's swift imagination carried her on with a rush 'you don't know in the least the type of man he is
you'd have to give in to him he'd never give in to you
he's domineering jealous vindictive and reserved
before a month was out you'd quarrel and there would be no chance of your ever making it up again'
'i must say joan that for a friend of his you're not an enthusiastic advocate'
'it's because i'm so fond of colin that i hate the thought of your making him miserable
anyway however you're bound to do that'
'i don't see why'
'if you flirt with him and then drop him he'll suffer though he'll be too proud to show it
and as for the alternative it's out of the question
you must see that it would be sheer folly'
'i've committed a great many follies' said bridget wistfully
'but so far none that are quite irrevocable'
'well he hasn't asked me yet to commit this one'
'you're leading him on to it
biddy it is abominable of you to encourage him as you docoming here with him that day and you let him take you riding'  'yes he knows now that i can ride'
'and he's at government house nearly every dayi can't think what lady tallant is about to ask him so often to dinner'
'she likes him because he takes luke off her hands
you know we've nicknamed him the unconstitutional adviser'
'that's rubbish
you sing to him'
'what harm is there in my singing to colin mckeith'
'as if you didn't know well enough that you're perfectly irresistible when you look at a man while you're singing those neapolitan things
biddy it won't do
give it up'
'i can't do that joan'
she spoke with a strange earnestness
'don't you see that it's giving me a chance'
'of forgetting mr willoughby maule'
'yes
but it's more than that'
'more than that do you mean  can you mean that you could love colin mckeithfor himself'
'love is a big word joan
i've never said to any mani love you'
she spoke the words now as if she were uttering a sacred formula
her voice reminded mrs gildea of somethingthe same note in the voice of colin mckeith when he too had spoken of love
yet what she had said was true
bridget had talked often enough of falling 'in love'which she had always been at pains to define as a mere transitory conditionnot by any means the 'real thing' and she had freely confessed to violent attractions and even adorations
but as she had sometimes solemnly stated she had never 'loved'
'i can't explain' she went on
'i know you think me a heartless emotional flirt
yes i am
i admit it
but there's a locked door in the inner chambera shrine that no one has desecrated
the goddess is there waitingwaiting to reveal herself'
'and soall the rest have beenexperiments'
'no the quest of the ideal through the forest of illusion
i've often thought joan there was a lot in the motive of that novel of thomas hardy's the well beloved
but i seem to be mixing up my metaphor and it's time i went back to government house'
she got up and began putting on her gloves
mrs gildea laughed hysterically
somehow she could not imagine colin mckeith producing the golden key and masterfully taking possession of lady bridget's locked shrine
she could only think of him as tricked deceived and suffering hideously at the end
she stammered out her fear beseeching biddy to be merciful but biddy's mood had changed and she only smiled her sphinx smile
'i think he's quite able to look after himself' she said
'and if he isn't sure he must take the consequences'
chapter    mrs gildea could get nothing more out of lady bridget
she attacked mckeith in a more tentative manner but colin was doggedly reticent
he was taking the thing hardly
his way of facing a serious situation was by setting his teeth and saying nothing
after these unsuccessful attempts joan made opportunity before leaving for a private word on the subject with lady tallant
but rosamond tallant treated the matter at first very lightly
'dear mrs gildea you needn't worry it's only biddy's way
she must have some excitement to keep her going
if it isn't one thing it's another
in london i tried to interest her in society or politics and the operaand now luke is trying to interest her in colonial questionsbut she always drifts back tomen
she can't help it
and the funny thing is i don't believe that in her heart she is capable of a serious attachment'
'i'm not so sure of that' answered mrs gildea
'if so she has had plenty of opportunities of proving it
but i wasn't ever afraid even of willoughby maule
i was certain that would fizzle out before real harm could come of it
and mercifully it did
he's married a woman with a quarter of a million and the right to dispose of it absolutely as she pleases
i heard that she signed a will on her wedding day leaving it all to him in the event of her death
too great a temptation wasn't it
though i do think if biddy had chosen she might have kept him in spite of miss bagalay and her money
as it is colin mckeith or else the novelty of it all out herehas driven him out of her head
i felt sure of that when i asked her to come
you needn't worry about her'
'it's not so much about biddy that i'm worrying as about my old friend colin mckeith' said mrs gildea
'it isn't fair that he should be made a victim'
'oh well it isn't altogether biddy's fault that she attracts all types of men'
and then lady tallant made exactly the same remark as lady bridget
'i think mr mckeith is quite able to look after himself
i don't pity him in the least
didn't somebody say of lady something or other that to love her was a liberal education'
'steele said it of lady elizabeth hastings'
'i call it a liberal education for colin mckeith to love lady bridget o'hara' laughed lady tallant
mrs gildea changed her tactics and voiced her other feara more insistent fear
'has it ever occurred to you that lady bridget o'hara might fall in love with colin mckeith'
'why my dear she's wildly in love with him already' rejoined lady tallant to joan gildea's surprise
'you've seen it'
'i'm not blind and i know biddy
but i've seen that she's taking this affair differently from the others and that's what makes me think it has gone deeper
a very good thing for biddy'
'you can't mean that it would be a good thing for biddy to marry colin mckeith'
lady tallant's social manner was rather full of affectations
underneath it however lay commonsense and sympathy
she became suddenly simple and direct
'well now mrs gildea let us look at the matter without prejudice
you are fond of biddy and so am i but we know her drawbacks
naturally it wouldn't be a good thing under ordinary conditions but is she likely to do much better'
'she has had plenty of chances'
'and thrown them all away
and though she looks so young she is close on thirty
of course with her looks and her fascination she ought to have married well
i'm sure her friends have tried hard enough for her
but what can you do with a girl who throws herself at the heads of ineligibles and when one trots out an unexceptionable parti and does one's best to bring them together goes off at a tangent and lets the whole thing drop through
you know how it was with' lady tallant enumerted names
mrs gildea acquiesced mournfully
lady tallant continued  'the truth is biddy has tired out the patience of her relatives and friends
molly and chris gaverick got the hump over willoughby maulewho would have done well enough if he had only had more money
old eliza'so lady tallant irreverently styled the dowager countess of gaverick'told me herself that she was going to wash her hands of biddy
i shouldn't wonder if she didn't leave her a penny
and after all it was her own fortune and she has a horde of needy relatives
she will consider that she has done her duty to the gavericks if she lets chris have the castle
when all's said and done i don't see that it would be such a bad thing for biddy to marry a rich australian squatter'
'colin mckeith is not rich'
'oh he will be
sir luke has been hearing all about him'
'he's not her equal
his father was just a land bailiff and his grandfather a crofter'
'oh what does that matter
in these days any of us would marry the roughest of rough diamonds provided he was decently well off
biddy has always been mad after adventure and an openair life
she's an original and everything would be in keeping'
lady tallant went on briskly
'she would enjoy living among the blacks provided they did not murder her and i suppose one could trust mr mckeith for that'
'oh there's no danger from the blacks now' put in mrs gildea
'and then she needn't be buried for ever in the bush
luke tells me that colin mckeith is certain to come to the fore in politicsi daresay he will be premier of leichardt's land before long
biddy would like bossing the show and airing her philanthropic crazes'
mrs gildea shook her head doubtfully
'colin wouldn't agree with them
besides she would be expatriated'
'oh no
the big men over here are always taking trips to england being feted and made much of in downing streetimperialist policy and that sort of thingi can see biddy at it'
mrs gildea was silent
she scarcely knew lady tallant in this downright mood
'there's no use blinking matters' said that lady
'at home biddy has been a failure
that was why i persuaded her to come out with us
i knew she wanted a fresh start badly'
it was quite true
mrs gildea remembered bridget's confidences to herself
she could not help feeling that lady tallant was right in the main and put forward no more objections
but she explained her own plans and the necessity for her immediate departure from leichardt's landhow she had hoped too to take biddy with her and interest her once more in literary and artistic work
'biddy won't go she told me so and i don't mean to let her' said lady tallant decidedly
'we're shorthanded till the new private secretary gets here and she helps me with my notes and things generally
and if it wasn't for biddy's singing our dinners would be too deadly dull for words'
joan gave up in despair
she suspected that lady tallant's affectionate candour was not unadulterated with selfishness
finally rosamond promised that she would interest and amuse lady bridget to such an extent as would deter her from rash lovemaking for want of counter excitement
then joan reflected colin was preeminently a prudent business man and as he had told her some time before would have to go back to the upper leura before the strenuous work of the session came on
this was always supposing that the present ministry kept in without going to the country upon certain labour measures unacceptable to the large landowners in which case it was just possible mckeith might be thrown out of his seat
events lay in the lap of the gods
mrs gildea wound up matters at the cottage and took train south where she was soon wholly occupied in describing the wonder of the jenolan caves and the wild gorges and primaeval gum forests in the blue mountains
she was really too busy in the interests of the imperialist to worry over her friend's love affairs
in fact she gleaned most of her information as to the leichardt's town government house party from the newspapers she happened upon at bush hotels
for lady bridget was evidently in a reactionary mood as regards letterwriting and colin mckeith never put pen to paper if he could avoid doing so except on business
it was at mossvale that she read a florid paragraph in the ladies' page of a sydney journal telling of the engagement of 'that intrepid pioneer and future empirebuilder mr colin mckeith to the lady bridget o'hara niece of the late and cousin of the present earl of gaverick'
next post brought her three brief and characteristic letters
she opened lady tallant's first   'government house   leichardt's town
'dear mrs gildea  i do hope this may catch you before the newspapers which i find announced the engagement rather prematurely last week
i am still of opinion that biddy might do much worse than marry colin mckeith though entre nous the settlementsor rather want of themfor mr mckeith tells us that he needs all his capital for making wells and buying cattle and he won't injure his prospects and biddy's by tying it updoes not at all please sir luke who before he would countenance the marriage insisted upon a cablegram being sent to the dowager lady gaverick
her answer not my business must do as she pleases only confirms what i said to you and i am afraid biddy's chances are worth nothing in that quarter
the wedding is to be early in may from government house of course and i need scarcely say how much we all hope you will come back for it
always sincerely  rosamond tallant
psno doubt biddy is giving you full details'
but biddy did not indulge either in details or rhapsodies
she began   'they say hanging and wiving go by destiny and clearly my destiny is to become the wife of collin mckeith
i've always felt that the only thing which could reconcile me to marriage would be marrying a man and at last i've found one
i want to tell you joan that we've made an agreement to ask each other no questions about respective pasts
the blackfellows he has slainthe one jarring note between usare never to be resuscitated
the men whose hearts i have broken and vice versa are dead and buried on the other side of the equator under a monument of inviolable silence
such are the terms of the marriage contract and you in especial must respect them
i need say no more except this have no fears for the happiness of  your biddy'
from colin in telegraphic conciseness  'tremendously happy
she's absolutely my idealin everything but size'
all very satisfactory and conclusive
butmrs gildea could not escape from a vague misgiving
she was not afraid of the ghost of mr willoughby maule indeed she argued favourably from the baldness of bridget's letter in comparison with the reams of sentiment she had written upon the previous occasion
nor did she feel uneasy on the score of any others of lady bridget's bygone passions
but had this complex fastidious physicallyrefined creature the least comprehension of what life on the upper leura might mean
and how about an ideal dethroned from her pedestal and plumped down amid the crude realities of the nethermost bush
mrs gildea did not get to the wedding
she was ordered to report on the mines of western australia and was on the other side of the continent when the marriage took place
in fact it seemed doubtful whether she would again meet lady bridget before her mission as special correspondent ended
but the mckeiths were to spend their honeymoon in travelling to his station on the upper leura a distance of some hundreds of miles from the nearest port and quite out of the imperialist programme
she read however circumstantial accounts of the wedding and there were portraits of the pairin which colin looked grumpy and lady bridget whimsically amusedsnap shots too of the wedding cortege in which sir luke tallant fathering the bride appeared a pompous figure in full uniform and lady tallant in splendid panoply most stately and gracious
a long account followed of the bride's family connections in which the biographer touched upon the accident of sex that had deprived her of the hereditary honours the ancient descent of the gavericks with a picture of the old irish castle where lady bridget had been brought upand so forth and so forth
mrs gildea sighed as she read and pictured in her imagination the wild wastes of the nevernever land and the rough headstation which was to be lady bridget's home
book ii  from the point of view of lady bridget o'hara     chapter    it was the way of the o'haras to do things first and to consider afterwards whether it were well or ill that they should be done
many a ruined o'hara might have fared differently in life's battle had he thought before he acted
lady bridget was no exception to the rule of her family
she had accepted colin mckeith in a blind impulse of escape from the old hedgedin existence of her order of which she was quite tired and wherein she had proved herself a failure
she had been attracted by the idea that he represented of wide spaces and primitive adventures
she had always longed to travel in untrodden ways and had loved stories of romantic barbarism
and then too some queer glamour of the man had got hold of her
she was intensely susceptible to personal influencehis bigness his simplicity his strength and daring and the feeling that he was quite capable of mastering her not only by brute forcewhich always appeals to a certain type of womanbut by power of will by a tenacity of passion which she recognised even through the shy reserve with which mckeith tried to cloak his adoration
for she was goddess to him as well as ladyloveand that she realised plainly
a look from her would make him go white and his large hands tremble an unexpected grace from her would fill him with reverent ecstasy
the thing happened one soft moonlit evening after dinner at government house when she had strolled out alone to a secluded part of the terrace and he had followed her after the men left the diningroom
she was in a mood of tempestuous raging against her ordained lot
letters had come from england that day which had irritated her and made her wonder how she could endure any longer her galling state of dependence
eliza countess of gaverick had sent her a meagre cheque accompanied by a scathing rebuke of her extravagance
some cutting little sarcasms of molly gaverick's had likewise annoyed her and she fretted under the miserable sense of her inadequacy to the demands of a world she despised and yet hankered after
then sir luke had been tiresomely pertinacious over some small dereliction on bridget's part from the canons of government house etiquette which he had requested should not be repeated
rosamond tallant had been tiresome also and had made her feel that even here she was no more than a dependent who must conform to the wills of her official superiors
joan gildea might have served as a safetyvalve but joan was away in or near the jenolan caves and could not be got at unless bridget chose to throw up other things and go to her which bridget was not inclined to do
the whole thing was a tangle
if only it were possible to find a way out that would not prove still more painfully complicated
at the moment the tingtang of a steamer bell bound outward to the northern coast borne to her on the riverbreeze intensified her desire for escape from conventional limitations
oh
to find herself under totally new conditions
the heavy fragrance of magnolia and gardenia blossoms seemed freighted with exotic suggestion
the tropical odours blended with the perfume of autumn roses which made a trellis over her head and overran the balustrades
the subtle mingling of perfumes that float in the clear air of an australian garden when the fierce heats of summer are gone gave her a sense of almost intoxication
in fact bridget was in the mood for any desperate leap into the unknown
such was her unconscious thought as she crunched a spray of verbena in her fingers and inhaled the scent which had always a faintly heady effect upon her imagination
she was leaning on the stone kerb of the balustrade vague emotions stirring her when she heard mckeith's step on the gravel
presently he stood beside her his tall form in the wellcut evening suit which always became him best towering head and shoulders above her small stature
it was always a satisfaction to lady bridget fastidious in such masculine details that he was particular about his tailoring and tonight he exhaled the scent of one of sir luke tallant's excellent cigars
there used to be a good deal of chaff between them about one of his personal predilections which jarred a little upon bridgethis pipe and particularly the quality of his tobacco
but he did not change it in spite of her chaff
she was beginning to find a certain mulelike obstinacy about him in unimportant details
'if you object to this what would you say to the store tobacco smoke when i'm in the bush'
he said
and then he had explained that when camping out with the stockmen on their expeditions after cattle he always smoked the same tobacco that he supplied to his hands
that was according to his rule of social equality by the camp fire he said and where was all lady bridget's vaunted socialism if she jibbed at such a simple illustration of the first principles of socialism
of course bridget had taken his banter in good part and with a pretty grimace had told him she would get out a consignment of the stuff her aunt eliza gave at christmas to the old men in their irish village and present him with it
he threw away the butt end of sir luke's cigar when he joined her
for several moments he stood watching herthe picturesque little figure in its dainty frock the grace of the small head with its crop of untidy hair the pale pointed facechin resting in the cup of one flowerlike hand red lipsthe upper one like cupid's bowslightly parted strange deep eyes gazing across the dark expanse of river to the scattered lights on the high land opposite
above the southern cross set diagonally in the dark clear sky gemmed with its myriad stars
there could be no doubt that colin mckeith was in the grip of an infatuation such as he had never known before in his life
it staggered him
his breath caught in his throat and ended in an uncertain laugh
he stuttered in sheer awkwardness
'ii say  you seem to be up in the clouds
you've been awfully down in the mouthall through dinner
won't you tell me
is anything the matter'
bridget turned and looked at him
her eyes were softly glistening her lips trembled
he thought of her as of a child seeking sympathy in a strange land where nobody understood her and somebody had been unkind
he was intensely stirred by her impulsive appeal
'oh
i'm worried
i'm so alone in the world
nobody wants mehere or in england either
i was just wondering if i couldn't go off and join joan gildea
but she wouldn't want me either perhaps'
he went closer stooping over the balustrade
magnetic threads seemed to be drawing them to each other
he wanted to say 'i want you' but dared not
he blurted forth instead
'what is it
i'd cut off my right hand if that would be of any use to you
good lord
that does sound cheek
onlyyou knowi'm big enough to bully the whole of leichardt's land from the governor downand i'd do it if you wanted me to
just tell me what's worrying you'
'it's everythingthe whole set of conditions from the day i was born into them'
'conditions are easy enough things to break if you're determined to do it
look heretalk it out you can trust me'
then she recklessly set the flood gates openlaughed with tears in the laughter drew a tragically amusing picture of her lifeher anomalous position her dependence her hatred of the pretences the shifts the sordid bravado by means of which her impoverished gaverick relatives clung on to their social birthright the toadying of the dowager the worldly admonitions of rosamond tallant and her setshe used some of the phrases he had himself read in that letter
had he been in any doubt as to its authorship that doubt must now be at rest
but he would never tell her of that episode
for one thing his promise to joan bound him
like a stab came the remembrance of that man of whom biddy had writtenthe man towards whom she had confessed a violent attractionand who had behaved as a cad and a fortunehunter would naturally behave
that he could have weighed money in the balance with this
she could not have cared for the fellow or he must have thrown over everything else for her
was it possible that she had caredthat she still cared
'tell me' he asked hoarsely
'is it that you are fretting after somebody over there whosomeone you can't marry
there must have been a lot of men in your life
perhaps there was one whowhom youloved'
his voice dropped as it had a way of doing when he touched the sacred subject
'there have been a lot of men' she admitted frankly
'but there has never been one true man among them
i've never really in my heart wanted to marry any of them if that's what you meani don't like marriageour system of marriagea bargain in the sale shop
so much at such a pricebirth position suitability good looksto be paid for at the market value
or else it's just because the man happens to have taken a fancy to one and while the fancy lasts doesn't think whether or not it's a fair bargainon either side
i've seen people fall madly in love and marry like that
then before very long the love turns to hate and it's a case for the divorce court'
'nothing of that islovenot as iand youunderstand it'
she gave him one of her inscrutable looks and then turned again to the stars
there was silence colin thought she must hear his heart thumping but she seemed lost in her dreams
he put out his big hand and timidly reverently took hers crushed verbena and all as it lay on the balustrade
it rested like a prisoned bird within his he could feel the nervous twitch of the little fingers
'there's another system of marriagea better one i thinkwhere the man doesn't ask for anything but the right to love untiluntil he has compelled the woman's love in return'
'compelled
i like that word
i could yield to my master
but he would have to prove himself my master'
'will you let me try'
mckeith said boldly
he grasped her hand tightly as he spoke she gave a little cry for he had hurt her
he was all compunction and gentleness in a moment
'oh you are strong'
she said
'i almost think you could make me do anything you chose'
'nothat isn't what i meant'
he seemed trying to steady himself
'i'm damned if i'd ever give up my freewill to anybody and i wouldn't like even the woman who was my mate to do it either
but lovethat's a different thing'  'your mate'
she repeated
'you don't know the bush idea of a real mateshoulder to shoulder back to backno getting behind one or the othergiving up your life for your mate if it came to a pinch'
'and that's your idea oflove'
'something like it only closer dearera thing you couldn't talk about even to your mateunless your mate was your wifea flower that blooms once in your life and that would neverif it were cut offcome to bloom again
look here' he said fiercely 'have you ever felt for any one of the lot of men you spoke about just like that'
'nno' she answered slowly
'if you told me you had i'd walk away now down those steps' he pointed to the flight of stone steps leading from the terrace to the drive'and you wouldn't see me any more
but i'm not going to leave you now i mean to stick on for all i'm worth so long as i see the faintest chance of your giving me what i've set my heart on'
'yeswell'
she stared at him in a fascinated manner
'wellbridgeti can't milady you
we're man and woman and nothing else tonight'  she interrupted
'i like you to say that
i feel now that we at least are realnot social shams'
'bridgetyou said you'd never found yet a real man to love you
here's one'
he patted his broad chest with his open palm
'i'm a rough bushy and there's not a frill about me but i'm bedrock if you come to reality
i'm a lode you've never struck in your life before
there's payable gold here if you choose to work me'
she laughed nervously considering him
'mr mckeith i'm sure that you're a perfect mount morgan and you certainly have a most original way of putting things
do you happen to own a gold mine by the way'
he drew in his breath slowly as if he were considering the check then he took her cue
'oh well
i have pegged out a good many claims in my time and never got much more than my tucker out of any of themthough there was a show i came on once up the gulf way that i've always been a bit sorry i didn't stop and look into
but rations were short and the blacks bad
however that's neither here nor there now
gold mine or not i'm positive that i shall be a rich man before many years have passedall the richer for a true mate to stand by me'
'yes of course' she said hastily'i wasn't thinking of thatwhether you were rich or not i mean'
'i know you weren't
all the same i suppose your grand relations would consider me a presumptuous boor for daring to lift my eyes to you
and yet if i could make you love me it wouldn't count for a blade of grass that your father was born in a castle and mine in a crofter's cabin onlyyou know too' he became timid and hesitant again'you know it isn't that i don't feel you as far above me almost as those stars in the sky'  'oh don't don't mr mckeith
it isn't true you know
i've told you how i despise all thatall the life i've led'
'yes i know
there's not such a difference between us when we stand as we are now right on the bed rock
you're like me in having a strain of workingfolk's blood in you
it's nature you're hankering aftergod's sweet air and the breath of the gum trees and freedom for your soul'
'freedom for my soul
how strange that you should understand'
'i understand better than you might think
you want more than freedom to make you content
you want a kind of bondage that is the truest freedomlovea strong man's love a strong man's worship
and that's what i'd give you bridget
are you angry with me for saying it'
'no'
she turned her face straight to him without any shadow of embarrassment
'mr mckeith i'm too honest to pretend that i didn't half expect this
i felt you were beginning to care for me and i was wondering whether i ought to let you go on'
'whether you ought to let me
as if you would be able to hinder it
why you couldn't stop me loving you
you might as well try to dam up the river leichardt with this little hand i'm holding'
she would have withdrawal it but could not
'no no
it isn't strong enoughthis tiny trembling hand which i could break to bits in mine if i wanted to
and could you prevent me from taking you in my armsyou wee great ladyand carrying you right awayaway out into the bush where i'm on my own ground and where not one of your swell men folk would have a chance to find you'
'i don't think any one of them would want to'
she laughed again tremulously
'if it comes to that though i fancy you'd have some trouble in disposing of me against my will'
'do you think i'd ever want you against your will
no
i'd sooner cut the whole show and let you scorn me at a distance as much as you pleased'
'iscorn you

i wouldn't scorn you'
'and even your scorn wouldn't kill my love' he said in that moved voice that was so unlike his ordinary utterance'because there's nothing in the universe so far as i know it that would be able to do that
why it seems to me that my feeling for you is as much a part of myself as the very blood in my heart
i knew you were the only woman in the world for me the moment i saw youso slim and small and strange the very contrary of what i'd always thought would be the kind of woman i'd be in love withthat day when you came walking along that gangway behind lady tallant
it was just a revelation and then i bolted straight off to alexandra city'
'which seems rather odd doesn't it in the circumstances'
'no it's this way
i had to take a few days for getting over the shockfor rubbing in the fact that what i wanted more than anything on god's earth now i'd seen it was utterly beyond my reach'
'one might think i was an enchanted princessa sort of brunhilda guarded by a fiery dragon'
'that's a good bit of how i looked on youthough i've never made much out of wagnerhe isn't human enough for me and how could i have dreamed then that you'd ever let me come as near you as i am this evening'
'i must say mr mckeith you haven't shown such extreme diffidence in approaching me'
'ah
because you soon showed that brunhilda's dragon was only pasteboard and blue fire after allone of the shams you despise
i'm not afraid of him now oh it's wonderful
it's beautiful'  he took her other hand and held the two covered over by his own as he said with an odd solemnity  'lady bridget o'hara will you come away with me to the bush leaving everything else behind you'
she stood very slender and erect her eyes shining in the moonlight out of her small pale face and fixed upon him thoughtfully as if she were weighing his proposition
after a few minutes she answered deliberately
'yes mr colin mckeith i will go away with you into the bush leaving everything else behind methe old lady bridget o'hara included'
he gave an indescribable ejaculationjoy surprise triumphall were in the utterance
dropping her hands he stooped to her and his arm went round her
'oh
biddy 
darling'
she knew he wanted to kiss her and that he scarcely dared so greatly as his beard brushed her cheek she shrank and moved a step from him
he too shrank hurt by her rebuff
'you mustn't beardent' she said
'you must give me time to get accustomed tothe fate i've chosen
you know the dragon isn't altogether a sham
he's got a few kicks in himyet'
chapter    on other occasions also lady bridget made mckeith feel that she preferred good fellowship to lovemaking
she was perfectly charming always excellent company and she had a sense of humour which delighted him but she did not encourage effusiveness
she seemed to want to hear about the bush a great deal more than she wanted to hear about his feelings towards herself and appeared anxious to show him that she meant to be a thoroughgoing 'mate'
the phrase had taken her fancy
there was not much opportunity however for exchanging sentimental confidences
everything was rush and hurry during the few weeks between the engagement and the marriage
it was plain that lady tallant wished to get the wedding over before she and the governor started upon a tour of the important stations in the settled districts round leichardt's town officially contemplated
bridget had a shrewd suspicion which she confided to colin that lady tallant was getting tired of her
perhaps bridget did not keep herself sufficiently in the background to please the lady of government house
her unpunctuality too often annoyed sir luke
another reason for not delaying the marriage was that the leichardt's land government was expected to go out of office on a labour bill and that an appeal to the country would certainly follow its defeat
in that case mckeith's reelection would have to be considered and an electioneering honeymoon in one of the outback districts was an inspiring prospect to lady bridget
then the preparation of a bush trousseau needed thought and discussion
she had not much money either to buy her trousseau with
bridget would have none of sir luke's suggestions of conciliatory letters and cablegrams to eliza lady gaverick on the subject of settlements
she said she did not intend to cadge any longer upon her rich relative and that she preferred to marry without settlements
sir luke was not satisfied with mckeith's views upon the financial question and had some difficulty in getting him to tie up even the insignificant sum of three thousand pounds in settlement upon his wife
colin pointed out that his capital was all invested in cattle and that though things would be all right as long as there were good seasons a bad one would cripple him and he would need money to recoup his losses and buy fresh stock
bridget took his view and sir luke frowned but did what he considered his duty so far as the paltry settlement went
at all events it was a satisfaction to colin mckeith's shrewd scotch mind that nobody insisted upon getting the better of him in the matter
he knew that bridget never gave it a second thought
she was much more interested in the social and racial problems of this new country of her adoption and especially in the blacks
what time she could spare from her trousseau she spent in reading books about them which some of her official friends got her from the parliamentary library and had already learned to think of herself as a 'bujeri white mary' whose mission it might be to compose the racial feud between blackman and white
bujeriblack's term of commendation
to colin knowing now the tragedy of his youth she did not speak much on this subject
the time went with startling rapidity
the two were borne on the tide of colin's wild elation and bridget's more impersonal enthusiasms
they were like travellers steaming through strange seas not knowing what they were going to find at the end of the voyage and too excited to care
that was the way of bridget o'hara but it was not the way of colin mckeith
yet his closest intimates would scarcely have known him at this period
he was as a man bewitched with intervals only of his ordinary commonsense
in these intervals the consciousness of glamour made him vaguely uneasy
had joan gildea been there she would have seen all this and would have observed signs of overstrain in bridgetsomething faintly apprehensive yet obstinately determined
and joan would have understood that when an o'hara woman gets the bit between her teeth she will not stop to look back or to consider whither she is galloping
bridget kept herself continually on the go
latterly even colin was warned by her nervous restlessness
when they were alone together which was not long nor often her body seemed never still her tongue rarely at rest
sometimes her talk was brilliantly allusive at others it was frothy chatter
one day it really irritated him
she had been fluttering about the sittingroom opening on to the terrace which lady tallant had made over to her guest
an english mail had come in
she read him bits of a letter from molly gaverick and made explanatory satiric comments upon those impecunious aristocratic relatives who were on the fringe of the london smart set of which bridget herself had lately formed a yet more outside part
'chris gaverick has gone into the wine business and they've taken a tiny house in davies street berkeley square and the eaton place house pays its rent  you don't understand
 no molly and i talked it out when they were married
of course it seemed madness with their means to take a house in eaton place
they ought to have had one in bayswater
but it has answered splendidly
you see they put their wedding presents into it and let it for the season and managed to live rent free and have the use of other people's motors and all the going about they wanted without paying even for their food  and no expense of entertaining outside a dinner or two at hurlingham
cadging
in london society everybody cadges except the millionairesand they're cadged upon you see as molly said you can't entertain in bayswater or know the right people and go about to the right houses which is the most important thing for a poor couple who want to keep their heads up
now the result is that chris is able to bring in quantities of clients and gets a commission on all the wine he sells what's the matter colin
you look quite fierce'
'and that' commented mckeith 'is an english belted earl'
'irishthere's a difference
and are they beltedreally
isn't it a figure of speech'
'i don't know and i don't care'
'but wouldn't you care to hear molly's account of their visit to the duke and duchess of brockenhurst to meet the king and queen of hartenburg
molly is very sorry i wasn't there
she says that it would have made everything so much nicer for her and chris and that the king might have ordered some wine from his firm'
she was teasing
he knew it and it infuriated him
'oh no doubt you're sorry too that you weren't there with the duke and duchess and the king and queen and your cousins the earl and countess' he flung at her
'they'll be your cousins tooby marriage
and if you ever become a very rich man and take me back to england you'll have to chris and molly them and to give him a big order for wine'  that mollified mckeith
'and if i wasn't a rich man and didn't give a big order they wouldn't care a twopenny damn for me'
'molly mightn'tunless by chance you were taken up in high quarters and made the fashionlike cecil rhodes and doctor jim or some new edition of buffalo bill
then she'd call you one of nature's uncrowned kings
but chris gaverick isn't a bad sort if his wife would let him be natural
they hadn't got my cablegram about you colin when this was written' she went on
'i wish i could have told the queen myself
i'm sure she would have been sympathetic
and now i don't suppose i shall ever meet her again'
he rejoined with clumsy sarcasm
'i see
the queen of hartenburg was an intimate friend of yoursthe sort of chum who'd have been likely to drop in any day for a yarn and a cup of tea'
'she often did when she hunted with our hounds in ireland and it is true that the queen of hartenburg was quite an intimate friend of minefor two winters anyhow
but i assure you it hasn't made me proud and if the queen of hartenburg bores you let us talk of something else'
she gave another glance at the last sheet of lady gaverick's letter and thrust it into a pigeonhole of the writingtable then came back to the long settee on which he sat
all the time his gaze had never left her
she saw that he was disturbed
'what is the matter'
she asked again and sat down a little way from him on the settee
he turned sideways to her bending forward one large hand twisting his fair beard
there was a hungry look in his eyes but his passing illhumour had melted into a deep adoring tendeness
'biddymy matewill you answer me a questiontruthfully'
'i believe i can say honestly that truth is one of my strong points' she parried lightly
'i want you to be serious
i mean it seriously
i want you to tell me what determined you on marrying a rough chap like me
that letterthinking of you among those grandees you talking a language that's worse than greek to me brings the wonder of it home
as i look at you the thing seems just incredible'
'i can't understand why it should seem so surprising'
'why
you know what i mean
it's not only that your birth and bringing up are so superior to mine and that you had a right to look for a husband in a very different sort of positioni can see plainly that is what sir luke thinks'  'i don't carea twopenny damnas you saidfor what sir luke thinks
i've got my own ideas as to the kind of husband most likely to suit me'
'there's the marvel of it
for you must have had dozens of men wanting you
you are so beautiful'
'oh colin i've told you what i feel about the english marriage system
and par parenthese i'm not beautiful
i don't come up in the least to the artist's standard
my measurements are wrong
i'm too small'
'that's rot
there's a fascination about you no man can resistor woman either
i see it in the people who come here'
'if i happen to have drawn them into what rosamond used to call my mysterious sphere of influencewhich i seem to do without knowing it
i'm not sure though that either rosamond or luke approve of my drawing the leichardt's town people into my mysterious sphere of influence'
'i think if you ask me that lady tallant is a bit of a cat and sir luke more than a bit of a prig'
'no
you mustn't say a word against them'
it was not in bridget to be disloyal
'they've given me the time of my life'
'when you smile like that you remind me of a photograph of a picture i've seena woman i don't remember her name'
'mona lisala gioconda
i knowi've been told that before'
'yes that's it
mona lisa
people have written about her'
'reams
some day i'll read you what pater says of her unless you've read him alreadyby your camp fire'
for he had talked to her as he had talked to joan gildea about his readings and his dreamings under the stars in the bush
'eh
you shall teach me about these new writing chaps
i don't understand your uptodate theories
i've always gone in for plain factsstandard readinghistorygreat thoughts of great mindsold books brought out in people's editions
i'm up a treedownright bushed when you begin upon your queer ideasall those newfangled religions and notionstheosophy spooksabout the earth being alive and thoughts making a sort of wireless telegraph systemi do believe in that thoughto a certain extent
and your brotherhood of man
bosh
we're all like a lot of potatoes thrown into a sack and shaken about by circumstance
and the big ones come to the top and the little onesbecause they're littlesink to the bottom
i've always wanted to be one of the big potatoes and mean to be'
bridget laughed
she had a ringing laugh when she was amused
'oh
go on colin
i grant that you're a very big potato and i'm a very little one'
'you know i didn't mean it that way
you're the biggest potato in the whole bag as far as mind goes and you make me feel the smallest
you're so wonderful that the marvel of your being contented to marry me is a bit staggering
and that brings me back to my question which you haven't answered'
'how have i brought myself to the incredible enterprise of marrying an australian bushman
do you know'
she became suddenly serious'i have asked myself that question once or twice and i haven't been able to answer it'
the light of adoration in his eyes faded a little
'i've been afraid of that' he said slowly
i've been afraid that you might be rushing into the business without reasoning it outweighing all the sides of it'
'if i were it would only be the way of the o'haras'
his blue eyes became more troubled
'i've been afraid of that' he repeated
'bridgetsupposemy dear suppose it was to turn out a mistake'
'well i've made so many mistakes in my life and lived through them that one more wouldn't matter' she rejoined lightly
'this one would matterbecause it would be irretrievable
suppose that you were to find that you couldn't put up with the bush lifei've told you that you are letting your imagination and your enthusiasm run a bit away with you and that there may be hardships you don't reckon on
for though it all looks to me plain sailing now and i hope it will only be a year or two before i can put on a manager and give you the home and the climate that are more suited to you one can't tell in australia that there may not be a drought or that a cattle boom may not turn to a slumpdo you see'
'i shan't mind in the least colinthat is i shall mind immensely but if there comes a drought it will be quite exciting helping you to drag out the poor thirsty beasts when they get bogged into the waterholes as you were describing the other day'
he laughed
'youhelping to drag out bogged beasts
why
they'd drag you in'
'well there are other things
riding
i could help you to break in horses
all the o'haras are good on horseback'at which he laughed immoderately and told her that when she had seen one zack duppo on a buckjumper she would not be keen to try that game
but it might amuse her to help cut out a few tame bullocks on a drafting camp if she had a good old station mount that knew its work
she shuddered
'i love horses but i should run away from the first bullock that looked at me
i'm frightened of beasts and on second thoughts i should not want to pull out bogged ones
and i loathe cookingdomestic workin a house
it would be different out of doors
you've promised to teach me the first time we camp out how to makewhat do you call themjohnnycakes'
'ah
the first time we camp out together
if you knew how i've dreamed of that
biddy i've got plans in my mind for that' he caught her two hands in a fierce grasp and as he looked at her his eyes full of love he wouldgreatly daringhave held her close to his breast and kissed the provocative lips as yet almost virgin to his
but she made a shrinking movement and he acutely sensitive dropped her hands and the love that had flamed in his eyes gave place to the dour look she did not know so well
'why do you always keep me at a distance'
he said and drew abruptly away from her
'dear man you mustn't be importunate
itit's constitutional with me
i've always hated lovemaking at close quarters'
'always
does that mean that you've been in the habit of letting men kiss you'
'colin you are rudebrutal'
'd'ye think so
it seems to me that i'm only as nature made me
biddyif you feel like that nowhow will it be when you're my wife'
she flushed a little but as her way was evaded him
'perhaps i shall have grown more used to it all by that time'
'the time is not so longonly a fortnight from now
and when you hold me off from the touch of your handthe feel of your lipswell it makes me wonder'  she gave a little alarmed shiver
'don't wonder colin
don't worry and oh
before everything don't drive meit isn't safe with an o'hara woman
i can see that you don't understand womenof a certain type'
'oh
i grant you women haven't stood for a great deal in my life and the few i've known well have been of the humble human sort
but i do know this bridget'his face softened'i do know that a proud sensitive womanwhich is what you are and what i love you for beingis like a thoroughbred mare out the first time in harness
you must keep your hands tight on her and let her go her own pace
i can tell you too the carthorse kind that has to be driven with a whip and a geeup all the time wouldn't be the type for me'
she laughed gain but shakily
there was an appeal in her voice
'colin you've told me a lot about breaking in young horses and how patient one has to be with them
be patient with me now i'll try and answer your questiontruthfully
i only know in a very confused sort of way why i want to marry you
i think you must understand what a lonely sort of life i've led reallyand what a dreadful muddle i've made of itwell i've told you how i hated everything
and though i can laugh and be interested too in molly gaverick's way of looking at things and in her determination not to be out of the swimi was just as determined myself when i had the mood to be in itand though one side of me hankers after the push and the struggle and the worldlinessyet the other side of me revolts against it and longs to be washed clean of all the sordid social grime
there
i've felt about marrying you that it would be a new baptism into a bigger fresher purer lifedo you see'
'yesi see'
his tone was doubtful
'you've tried it beforethat idea of bigger interestsa different kind of lifein other ways biddy haven't you'
'oh
in ever so many ways
of course that wasn't only in the sense of lovehero worship you know
it was the schemes ideas plans for living in the higher part of one
tolstoy prentice mulfordthat kind of thing colin you blame me for not giving yet all my life i've been blamed for giving too freely'
'for giving too freely'
he repeated sharply
'you mustn't misunderstand me
i said it hadn't only to do with men making love to memy ideas about a different life
it was my general attitudeexpecting to meet something great and being disappointed of course i've sufferedsuffered horriblyin my heartin my pride
and i've often found that my attitude towards things brought me into difficulties
the average person if it's a mansupposes that because one has such ideas one must be a kind of abandoned creature
and if it's a woman that one has some mean ulterior motive
i've always seemed to be looking for largeness and finding only what was small
you attracted me because you're like naturebig simple elemental'
'now what the deuce do you mean by elemental'
'primal unadulteratedcloser to the heart of life and nature
it's a sort of cosmic quality
you are largeyour surroundings are large'
he laughed only half comprehending gauche in the expression of his deephearted satisfaction
'one thousand square miles two thirds of it fair grazing country in good seasons and will be firstrate when i've worked out my artesian bore system
plenty of space there for a woman to swing her petticoats inyour riding skirt it'll have to be'
'there
you see'
she cried
'could one be mean or small in such conditions
it's glorious the thought of riding over one thousand square milesand tapping mother earth for your water supply
it will be just what i saida new baptisma washing in jordan
but you will be patient colin promise me that you will be good to me and not ask too muchat first'
there came a note into her voice which intoxicated the man with hope and joy
but he restrained himself
he would not frighten her again
'good to you
biddyyou know you're sacred to mei'll do everythingi'll be as patient as you could wish until you get so used to me that everything comes naturally
you understand
so long as you'll trust me and open your heart to me i'm not afraid that you won't love me my dear in the end'
'i want to love you colin'
she moved a little closer to him and put her hand up timidly to his shoulder
his breath came quickly but he did not lose his selfcontrol
he knew that he must go gently with her
she drew her hand down his coat sleeve and let it rest like a snowflake on hisa contrast in its smallness and whiteness to the great brown hand beneath
she looked at that smiling whimsically and he saw her smile and reddened
but he did not know that she found a pleasure in the sight of his handscrupulously kept the nails as well trimmed as a bushman's nails can be while showing the traces of manual labour
'how ridiculous they are together'
she said softly 'but i like your hand colin
it's different from the other men's hands'
he was glad she said 'the other men's' and not 'the other man's'
through all the gusts of passionate tenderness that went out to her there was always rankling the thought of 'that other man'
chapter    they had only one more talk in the real sense before their marriage and that was an unpremeditated but natural outrush of the vague jealousy which slumbered at the core of mckeith's love
it was on the last evening and it made an ineffaceable impression upon him
they were standing after dinner close together by the balustrade of the terrace
it was a clear night with a young moon and the stars set deep in blue so dark that the sky gave an impression of solidity
the air was full of scents and of a soft balminess with the faint nip of an early may in the southern hemisphere
he had folded her light scarf round the childlike shoulders
the touch of his big hand stirred herit had not often done so in that peculiar way
it roused something in her that she had thought dead or drugged to sleep and took her back for an emotional moment to a certain late summer evening at hurlingham when she and willoughby maule had stood in the garden together under the stars
there came to her an almost fierce reaction against that moment
she felt a distinct emotion now but it was differentless tumultuous and bringing her a soft sense of enfoldment
she slipped her hand gently into mckeith's and they remained thus for nearly a minute without speaking
he was the first to break the silence
'bridget' he said impetuously 'we're going to be husband and wife tomorrow
it makes me tremble darlingwith happiness and hope and with fear too
what have i done a rough bushy like meto win a woman like you
well you know how i think about that
and i don't believe in a man belittling himself to the woman he loves though it's just because he loves her so that he feels unworthy of her
and then it comes over me againbadly sometimeshow little i really know of you and of your life and of your feelings towards the other men you must have had to do withone other man in especial may be that you've loved or may have thought you loved
that's what i want to know about my dear'
her face was turned from his as she answered  'what's the good of your knowing colin
whatever there was is past'
'but is it past
over and over again i've started to ask you and have pulled back
now it's got like a festering sore in my heart and i'm afraid it will go on festering unless i'm satisfied
there was somebody in especiala man you cared for and might have married if he had been a finer sort of chap than he turned out to be'
she looked at him sharply
'how do you know
has rosamond tallant been telling you'
'no' he said with complete candour
'there wasn't a word of that sort passed between usand i wouldn't have heeded it if there had'
'joan then
no i'm sure joan gildea wouldn't have talked behind my back'
'you may bet your life on that
joan hasn't said anything about whatever loveaffairs you may have had'
'every girl has had loveaffairs
i'm no exception to the rule
there's been no real harm in them
let them lieburied in oblivion
they're not worth resurrecting'
'no but'he persistedthinking all the while of that letter'bridget i must ask you this one thing
is there any man in the world you care for more than you care for me
i know' he added sadly 'that you don't love in the way i love youin the way i'd like to be loved by you
i know that's too much to expectyet'
the melancholy note in his speech touched her
'i told you that i do want to love you colinonly i can't help being what i am' she said softly
she looked up at him in the pale brightness of the thin moon and myriad stars
he stood with the faint illumination from the open windows of government house upon his fine head and his neat fair beard
it intensified the gleam in his earnest blue eyes while it softened his angularities and bush roughness and as she looked up at him she could not help feeling what a splendid fellow he was
what a man
so much finer than that other man to whom she had nearly given herself
ah she had had an escape
under all his show of romantic adventure his ardent protestations his magnetic charm that other man had been utterly sophisticated worldly selfinterested
he had shown this in his moneygrabbing in his disloyalty both to the woman he had professed to love and to the woman he had married for her fortune
thinking of him in this way lady bridget felt that in time she might come to care a great deal more for colin mckeith
he caught up her last words
'yes i know that you want to love me biddy and i hope with all my heart and soul that you willor else' he broke off his face darkening
'or elsewhat'
'i don't know
it would be hell
i can't think such a thing at this moment
if it comeswell i'll face it as i've had to face other ugly things
don't let us speak of the possibility'
she sensed some quality in him that she had not realised before
'you frighten me a little colin
it's as if i may any day come up before something i wasn't prepared for and yeti rather like it'
he smiled at her
'i'm glad you like it anyway
you seem to me such a child biddy though you are always telling me you are such an old soul
i can't for the life of me make out what you mean by that'
'oh
a soul that has come back and back and has lived a great manyperhaps naughtylives'
'h'm
yes
well one life is good enough for me and as we can't prove the other thing what does it matter anyhow
i wouldn't want you in another life if you were going to be quite a different person
i want you as you are in this one
and so i reckon would any man who has ever been in love with you
let us go back now to what i was asking you
biddy there was a manone man that you did care for
you've admitted as much'
'yesi suppose there was'
'and not so long before you came out here'
'i suppose that's true too'
'bridgetdo you know what's been festering in my mindthe thought that you might be marrying me in a fit of piquea sort of reaction
biddytell me honestly my dear if it's anything of that sort'
she seemed to be considering
'i don't quite know how to answer you colinif i'm to be absolutely honest
and i'd always rather tell you the truth'
'thank god for that
let there be truth between ustruth at any cost'
'you see' she said slowly
'my whole coming out hereeverything i've done lately has been done in reaction against all i've done and felt before'
'would you have married that manif everything had been on the square'
'what do you mean by on the square
i've done nothing to be properly ashamed of'
'nonoi was thinking only of him biddy did you love that manreally love him'
'i'm not sure yet whether i'm capable of what you'd call loving really
i had a violent attraction to him'he remembered the phrase'i confess i did feel it dreadfully when he married someone else
now it doesn't hurt me
and of course he has gone out of my life altogether
i'm glad he has and i hope he will keep on the other side of the world'
'well let it stop at that'
he drew a breath of relief
'i don't believe you really cared for him
if you had you couldn't take it as you do
i'll never bother you again about that man
and oh my dearmy dearit doesn't seem to me possible that you shouldn't come to love me when i love you as i dowith my whole heart and souli worship you biddy
and i'll not say again that i'm unworthy of youa man who loves a woman like that can't be unworthy'
he took her in his arms and kissed her
and this time she did not resist the caress
they were married with much flourish of trumpets and local paraphernalia
never before in the annals of leichardt's land had a wedding taken place from government house
this one was regarded as quite an official event
the executive councilat that moment about to undergo the pangs of dissolutionattended in a body
there were a great many members of parliament present also
it became even a question whether the official uniforms worn at sir luke's 'swearing in' should not lend eclat to the occasion
but colin mckeith vetoed that proposition
the bridal party drove straight from the church to that same extemporized wharf by the botanical gardens which had been put up for the governor's state landing
it had been reconstructed and redecorated for today's event
thus the embarcation of the bride and bridegroom of the viceregal party and the wedding guests in the government yacht which was to take the newmade pair to the big mailboat in the bay was almost as imposing a ceremony as the governor's entry into his new kingdom
the day was gloriousan early australian winter's day when the camellia trees are in bud and the autumn bulbs shedding perfumes and garlands of late roses honeysuckle and jasmine are still hanging on trellis and tree
as the bridal party came down the avenue of bunyas and the band played the wedding chorus from lohengrin a feeling of dreamlike incongruity came over bridget
she laughed hysterically
'what a pity joan gildea isn't here'
she said
'think of the copy she might have made out of this'
lady tallant had conceived the original idea of having the wedding breakfast on the deck of the government yacht while it steamed down the forty miles between leichardt's town and the river bar beyond which in those days large vessels could not pass
there the repast was laid on tables decorated with white blossoms and maidenhair fern under an awning festooned with flowers and exotic creepers and supported apparently by palm trees and tree ferns which had been taken from the government gardens
the bride looked small pale and quaint in her white satin dress and lace veil now thrown back and partly confining the untidily curling hair
some of the reports described her as being like an old picture others as a vision from fairyland
she came barely up to her husband's shoulder as they stood together and the adoring pride of his downward gaze at her stirred all the women's hearts and roused a sympathetic thrill in the men's breasts
colin made a good show in the regulation bridegroom's frock coat and with a sprig of orange blossom in his buttonhole
there was no doubt that he was extremely happy
he gave a short manly speech in response to sir luke's rather academic oration proposing the health of the wedded pair
the premier too made a speech and so did the attorneygeneral who was best man
bridget's bridesmaids had been selected from the daughters of the executive with as much attention to precedence as though she had been a royal princess
all this had delighted the leichardstonians and when sir luke read out the congratulatory cablegrams received that morning from the earl and countess of gaverick eliza countess of gaverick and one or two other members of the british aristocracy the enthusiasm was great
the speeches were over the wedding cake had been cut the riverbar and the liner were in sight when lady bridget went below and changed into seagoing blue serge
the mailboat beflagged in honor of the occasion dipped a salute
the governor led the bride along the gangway introduced the captain of the mailboat and there were more congratulatory speeches and still more of official ceremony as the bride passed by a line of inquisitive and admiring passengersfortunately there were not manyand down to the stateroom prepared for her
then the curtain seemed to fall that divided her from her past and when the governor stepped again on to the leichardt's land yacht and the last farewell had been waved lady bridget felt thankfully that she had become a private individual at last
only just bridget wife of colin mckeith bushman now starting upon her voyage towards the wild
she could not get away from the bewildering sense of unreality
it dominated every other feeling
she did not even reflect that there was no going back that her fate was sealed and that the bush was henceforth to be her prison or her paradise
all the way up the river rosemary tallant congratulated herself upon having done the best that was possible for poor biddy the failure
it was all entirely satisfactory
she wove a halo of romance round colin mckeith and after reading her laudation of him and her description of bridget's send off old lady gaverick and the impecunious chris and his wife declared to each other that biddy had done as well for herself as the family had any reason to expect
eliza lady gaverick was highly pleased though she would not for the world have let her niece by marriage know it
being scotch herself she approved of the scotch bridegroom and began now to think seriously of the alteration she subsequently made in her will
it was a four days' passage to leuraville the port at which the mckeith's were to be dropped
not being a good sailor lady bridget retired to her berth when the steamer got into a choppy sea
of course she had no maid
colin unpacked the cabin trunk and dressing bag and arranged things so far as he could understand his wife's dainty toilet equipments and his mistakes made them laugh and got them over the first awkwardness of close quarter
then he said  'now i'm going to stow away my own traps
my cabin is just facing this and you've only got to call out if you want anything
eh but my word
biddy it's a fine thing to be marrying from government house
the company has done us both proud'
chapter    they were landed at leuraville on the evening of the fourth day
a tender took them off with the mailsas it happened they were the only passengers for that small seatownship
ordinary business folk going north preferred the smaller coasting steamers which put in at every port
the postmaster the portmaster the police magistrate and a few local notables were waiting to receive them at the wharf
mckeith greeted them all heartily and rather shyly introduced them to his bride
the local men were shy also
they mostly addressed her as mrs mckeith
the police magistratecaptain halliwell lean dark sallow with a rather weak mouth but more carefully dressed than the others and with an english voice called her lady bridget
he was a retired officer of the royal engineers
she had been told and now remembered that men in the royal engineers were popularly said either to be religious or cranks
this man was a christian scientist which he announced when apologising for not offering the hospitality of his house a new baby having arrived the day previously ushered into the world he explained by prayer and faith and without benefit of medical skill
bridget knew something about christian scientists
she plunged at once into faithhealing ethics with the policemagistrate while colin saw about getting the trunks off the tender
how odd it seemed to be talking about london and christian science in a place like this
leuraville too seemed part of a dream
but her face soon lost its bewildered look
she became interested in her surroundings although there was no suggestion here of savage freedom or romantic adventure
leuraville showed low and hot and ugly
a red sun near its dropping drew up the miasmic vapours from the mangrovefringed reaches stretching on either side of the wharf
some light crafts were moored about
a schooner was loading up with cattlewretched diseased beasts
bridget watched them with shuddering repulsionbeing hoisted up and slung aboard with ropes
the men at their task swore so abominably that the policemagistrate stepped up to them and remonstrated on the plea of a lady's presence
bridget had never heard such swearwords
she was used to the ordinary 'damn' but these oaths were so horribly coarse
colin who was asking local questions of the other men appeared to take it all as a matter of course
the men stopped their work to stare at lady bridget
they wore dirty corduroys hitched up with a strap over flannel shirts that were open at the neck and left their brawny breasts exposed
there were other loafers in flannel shirts hitched up trousers and greasy felt or cabbagetree hats and there were two or three blacks of the demoralised type seen in coast townships
now one of the bullocks got loose and rushed blindly down the wharf and bridget shrieked and clung wildly to her husband's arm until it was headed back again
colin laughed at her terror
'it's all right biddy
but how's that for a bushman's wife
you'll see lots of cattle up at moongarr'
moongarr was the name off his station which was to be her future home
'i hate cows
once i was charged by a wild cow and i've been afraid of them ever since'
'that isn't a cow
it's mickey field's poleytailed bullock being shunted off to the boilingdown works on shark island' said a local man
the policemagistrate found his opportunity
'you wouldn't be afraid lady bridget if you realised that cow as an expression of the divine mind'
bridget laughed
her sense of the queerness of it all was almost hysterical
she had the irish wit to make the men grin at her prompt answer which when it became bruited up and down the leura earned her the reputation of being sharp at repartee
'but do you think' said she confidingly 'that the cow would be after realising me as an expression of the divine mind'
'eh you needn't think you're going to knock spots off my wife any of you' cried colin delighted at the sally
and now he walked and talked like a man on his own soil again as more of the townsfolk came aboutextraordinary people bridget thought
looselimbed bushriders really trim some of them in clean breeches and with a scarlet handkerchief doing duty as a belt unkempt old men a unionist labour organiser addressing a knot of stationhands out of workeven a chinamana chinky mckeith called him who it appeared kept a nondescript store
that was in the days before the commonwealth and the battle cry of 'white australia'
all of them showed the deepest interest in the small pale picturesque woman walking by colin's side
it seemed incredible to biddy that she should be walking like that beside the big bushman in this sort of town and that he should be her lawful protector
the street they walked up began from the wharf with twostoried respectable buildingsthe bank the postoffice the policemagistrate's residence some dwelling houses within palings enclosing gardensclumps of bananas pawpaw apple trees a few flower beds bushes of flaunting red poinsettia and so forth
there were stores public houses meaner shanties straggling along a dusty road that lost itself in vistas of lank gum trees
the postmaster hoped that mr mckeith's lady would not find the hotel too rowdy
it was one of the twostoried buildings and had a bar giving onto the street and a veranda round both upper and lower storey
a number of bushmen and loafers were drinking in the bar and others were on the edge of the veranda dangling their legs over it into the street
all of them stopped their talk and their drink to stare at lady bridget
the landladya big florid irishwoman in black silk with a gold chain round her neck came out onto the veranda and greeted mckeith as an old friend holding out her hand to lady bridget
she took the husband and wife up to their rooms a parlour opening on the balcony a bedroom over the bar and a little room at the back of it
'it's a rough sort of shop biddy' said colin when the woman had departed
'but it will do for a shakedown for tonight
if the steamer had come in earlier i'd have taken you straight up to fig tree mount where the buggy will be waiting for us and after that we'll begin our camping out and you'll be in the real bush
but we've lost the train and must wait till daylight tomorrow
you'll be tired my dearand you must be feeling strange' he added kindly
'i'll go and have your traps brought up and leave you to fix yourself
i want to see one or two chaps and find out whether my drays are down as far as fig tree for stores and what's going on up along the leura'
bridget noticed that the change in mckeith seemed yet more accentuated
his manner was more curt and decidedrougher than before
he appeared to have taken on the tone of the backblocks
yet she admired him
she did not dislike the roughness
but she felt a womanish aggrievement at his having left her to undo her own things
and the rooms were horriblethe meagre appliancesthe course cotton sheets the awful reckitt'sblue colouring of the painted walls
and then the dreadful noise of the men drinking below in the bar
if this was the bush
but colin had said it was not the bush
he left her again after dinner which was horrible likewiseburned up steak messy fried potatoes and cabbage an uneatable rice pudding
he did not seem to mind
the result of his enquiries had left him grim and preoccupied
yes he had taken on the bushman and had more or less dropped the lover
the practical scotch side of him was uppermost and he appeared more disturbed over station affairs than at her want of appetite
she resented this unreasonably
she had not wanted him to play the lover in these surroundings they would have been fatal to romance but she had not bargained for his glumness
he was angry at the nonarrival of his draymen and the probability that they were drinking at a grogshanty on the road
he would certainly sack them he said if that were the case
and he had disquieting news from moongarr
pleuro had broken out among the cattle
what was pleuro
lady bridget wondered but she was not sufficiently interested in cattle to ask the question
and the unionist labour men were making themselves a nuisancegoing round the stations burning the grass of squatters who employed nonunion stockmen and shearersin one instance threatening to burn a woolshed
and there hadn't been any rain on the leura for a month past and weather prophets were predicting a drought
it was dreadfully prosaic and boring
after he had gone out again to transact further business lady bridget went to bed and squirmed between the cotton sheets remembering ruefully the luxuries of government house
never in all her life had she slept between cotton sheets or washed herself in an enamelled tin basin
the noise in the bar became intolerable
she could hear the swearwords quite distinctly
they were disgusting
she tried to stop her ears  oh what a dreadful life this was into which she had plunged so recklessly
her thoughts went back to the oldworldto the luxurious veneer covering the younger gavericks' petty economiesstealing the notepaper at countryhouses for the sake of the addresscadging for motors and dinners'keeping in' with the people likely to be of use pulling strings in a manner which bridget knew would have been too utterly galling to colin mckeith's selfrespect
and she thought of her father and his financial unscrupulousness
but none of these could have conceived of life without certain appurtenances of that position to which they and she had been born
the only one who was selfrespecting among the lot was old 'eliza countess' as they designated her
it struck bridget that eliza countess and colin mckeith had points of character in commonit was true they both came from glasgow
she thought of the parsimonious rectitudewhich had of course included linen sheets and fine porcelain and shining silverof old lady gaverick's establishment of its stuffy conventionalitythough that had been soothing sometimes after a dose of upper bohemia and bridget wept feeling rather like a wilful child who had strayed out of the nursery among a horde of savages
at last she could bear it no longer
they were singing nowa terrible thing with a refrain of oaths and geeups and whistling noises like the cracking of whipsa bullock drivers' camp ditty
bridget shudderingly decided that a row in whitechapel could be nothing to this in the matter of bad language
she got up and paced the sittingroom in her dressinggown wondering when her husband would come and rescue her from these beasts
watching for him she could see through the uncurtained french windows the starry brilliance of the night and the moon now in its middle quarter
and down below the houses and shanties along the opposite side of the street the fantastic tufts of the pawpaws the long white road stretching away into the ragged blur of gumforest
presently a firm step sounded on the veranda and came up the stairs
when colin opened the door he saw standing by the table which had a kerosene lamp on the red cloth and even at this time of the year winged insects buzzing around and sticking to its greasy bowla small white figure like an apparition from another world in its wonderful draperies of lace and filmy white the little pale face framed in a cloud of shining hair and the strange eyes wide scared and with tears glistening on the reddened lids
she cried out at him
'how could you have left me alone here with those horrible drunken men down there making such a noise that i thought every minute they would break in on me
and swearing
i've never dreamed of such dreadful language and i can't stand iti won't stand it a moment longer'
'you shan't
it's abominable i've been a thoughtless beast'
he swooped out through the open door down the wooden stairs which creaked under his wrathful steps
bridget heard him call the landlady 'mrs maloney
come here'
in a voice of sharp command
presently she heard him speaking to the men in the bar not abusively indeed almost good humoured tone but imperatively
'look here mates'
the uproar stopped suddenly
'you're decent blokes i know and you've all had mothers if you haven't had wives
well there's a lady up thereshe's my wife and she's never heard bullockdrivers swear before and you've scared her a bit
just you stop it
shut up and be off like good chaps'
some dissentient voices arose an attempt at drunken ribaldry strident hisses 'sh
sh'
cries of 'shame'
'chuck it'
then again mckeith's voice this time like thunder
'stop that i sayone more word and out you go whether you like it or not'
on that came the noise of a scuffle and the fall of a heavy body across the veranda
and of mckeith once more breathing satisfaction  'all right
i haven't killed himonly given him a lesson 
but just you understand i'm not taking any of your bluff
you've got to go
if you don't it'll be a case of the lockup for some of you
and if you doquietly mind there'll be a shout all round for the lot of you tomorrow
drink my health and my wife's d'ye see
here mrs maloney chalk it down'
in five minutes he was back in the sitting room looking rather dishevelled and with his coat awry
but there was silence below except for the putting up of shutters the sound of shuffling feet along the road and snatches of the bullock drivers' chorus which gradually died away in the night
mckeith went up to his wife who was still standing by the corner of the table and put his arm round the little trembling form
'oh
biddymy darling
i've been a brute
i'm not fit to take care of you
i ought to have thought of all that
but one gets used to such goingson in the bush and they aren't bad chapsthe bullockys and you've got to discount their lurid language a bit
i don't know whether it is that bullocks are more profane than most animals but it's certain sure that you can't get them to move without swearing at them'
then as she said half crying half laughing 'i see
so this is my baptism into the bush
you should have taught me the vocabulary colin first'
'don't be too hard on me
you won't have this kind of thing at moongarr
that's the worst of these cursed coast townships
i shouldn't have left you alone but if i hadn't we couldn't have got off properly tomorrow and i'd set my heart on having things shipshape for our first camping out
everything's fixed up nowi've been wiring like mad up the line 
the buggy's at the terminus all right and i've got the blackboys there and the tent and all that
it's going to be an experience you'll never forget
that's to be your baptism into the bush my dear 
if only there's water enough left in the creek yet 
but if there isn't we can dig for it
oh biddy think of ita night like thismoonlight and starlightmy starlightmy star that i used to look up at and wonder about come down to earth
no no i won't maunder i won't be a romantic zanynot till tomorrow nighti know the very spot for our camp '  he began to describe ita pocket by the river bedpasturage for the horsesthen pulled himself short
no
he wanted it all to be a surprise  she was to have just the very thing she had often said to him she would like best  and now it was getting late and they must be up in good time tomorrow
would she go to bed and try to sleep
he took her to the door of her room  was she as comfortable as she could be here anyhow

he knew it must seem cruelly rough to her but it wouldn't be his fault in the future if she didn't have things as she liked themso far as conditions would permit  and after all there women who enjoyed a wild life with their husbands
there was lady burtonand scores of other womenbiddy had asked him to have patienceand he meant to be patienthe worshipped her too much not to be patient
well she must be patient too with him and with this queer old bush which she would get to feel as much at home in as he did himselfin time
he left her at her bedroom door kissing her hand with the native chivalry that sat well upon him and went back to his pipe and the waking dreams of an ardent but selfrestrained lover who had practical as well as romantic considerations to weigh
bridget went to sleep with the smell of his tobaccoand yet did not seem to mind it in the leastcoming in whiffs through the door cracks and filling her nostrils
she too dreameda vivid dream but by some law of contrariety not of any idyllic camping ground in the nevernever land
she dreamed that she was seeing the carnival at nicea medley of dancing waves azure sky palms goldladen orange trees and white greenshuttered housesflowers confetti masks grotesque pageantry the merry music of the south
and though he had never been with her at nice willoughby maule came into her dream
they were doing impossible thingsdancing together in the carnival crowd flinging confetti bobbing and grimacing before the comic masks
then the carnival scene seemed to turn flat and to become a painted picture on the drop curtain of a stage and she started up at the sound of knocks such as one hears before the curtain rises in a french theatre
chapter    her husband was at her door calling her in the grey of dawn
he had everything ready he said
she dressed fumblingly as if she were still in her dream and they walked to the stationshed whither the baggage had already gone
the sun was only a little way above the horizon when they took their places in the bush train that was to bear her on the second stage of her journey into the unknown
such a wheezy shaky little train and such funny ugly country
sandy flats sparsely grown mostly with gum trees where there were no houses and gardens
near the township there were a good many of these wooden dwellings with corrugated iron roofssome of the more aged ones of slaband with a huge chimney at one end
they were set in fenced patches of millet and indian corn or gardens that wanted watering and with children perched on the top rail of the fences who cheered the train as it passed
sometimes the train puffed between lines of grey slab fencing in which were armies of white skeleton trees that had been 'rung' for extermination or with bleached stumps sticking up in a chaos of felled trunks while in some there had sprung up sickly ironbark saplings
now and then they would stop at a desertedlooking station round which stood a few shanties and the inevitable public house
maybe it had formerly been a sheepfold abandoned when the scab had destroyed the flocks and there were enormous rusty iron boilingpots to which a fetid odour still clung and where the dust that blew up had the grittiness and faint smell of sundried sheeps' droppings
at one of the more important stopping places they had early lunch of more fried steak with sweet potatoes and heavy bread and butter and peach jam
most of the other passengers got out for lunch also
there was a fifthrate theatrical company cracking jokes among themselves drinking brandy and soda at extortionate prices and staring hard at lady bridget
colin pointed out to her a lucky digger and his familytwo daughters in blue serge trimmed with gold braid and a fat redfaced mamma very fine in a feathered hat black brocade a diamond brooch and with many rings and jangling bangles
there were some battered bearded bushmen who seemed to be friends of colin's though he did not introduce them to his wife and who talked on topical subjects in a vernacular which lady bridget thought to herself she would never be able to master
there was a professional horsebreaker whom mckeith hailed as zack duppo and to whom he had a good deal to say also
there were some gangs of shearers or stockmen or what not who appeared to be the following of two or three rakish aggressive looking males upon whom the bushmen scowled
union delegates strike organisers mckeith explained
after that station marks of civilisation diminished
the noah's ark humpeys in their clearings became few and far between and the long lines of grey tworailed fences melted into gum forest
now and then they saw herds of cattle and horses
once a company of kangaroos sitting up with fore paws drooping and a baby marsupial poking its head out of the pouch of one of the does
then taking fright in a second all leaped up long back legs stretched tails in air and in a few ungainly bounds they were lost to sight among the gum trees
early in the afternoon the train reached the temporary terminus for the line was being carried on by degrees through the leura district
this was a mining town called fig tree mountwhy nobody could tell for there were no fig trees and not a sign of a hill as far as the level horizonexcept for the heaps of refuse mullock that showed where shafts had been sunk
a good many years ago bridget was told there had been a rush to the place but the gold field turned out not so good as had been expected and it was only lately that the discovery of a payable reef had brought the digging population back again
from one direction came the whirr of machinery and there was in the same quarter a collection of white tents and roughly put up humpeys
otherwise the township consisted of a long dusty street cutting the sandy plain and out of the two score or so of zincroofed buildings twenty were public houses
lady bridget had been very silent all day
to colin's anxious enquiries she answered that it was enough to take in so many new impressions without talking about them
through the crude blur of these impressions her husband stood out definitely a dominant influence
she seemed to be only now beginning to feel his dominance
yet all the time she could not get away from the sense of living in some fantastic dreaman edward lear nonsense dream
the sight of the kangaroos in the bush brought a particular rhyme of her childhood to her mind
she half said half sang it to an improvised tune    'said the duck to the kangaroo   good gracious
how you hop
over the fields and water too   as if you never would stop'
she caught her husband looking at her in a fascinated puzzled way and paused and gave him her funny little smile
'that's a very pretty song' he said
'but i can't make out what it means
what is it about a duck or a kangaroo
they're nonsense words aren't they'
'nonsenseoh yes frightful nonsense
only it struck me that there's sometimes a lot of truth in nonsense
listen now' and she went on    'my life is a bore in this nasty pond   and i long to go out in the world beyond
i wish i could hop like you
said the duck to the kangaroo'
he still looked puzzledbut adoring
'you've got no sense of humour' she said 'don't you see that you and i are as incongruous as the duck and the kangaroo'
'that is so' he answered gravely
'but i'll be a kangaroo with pleasure if it makes the bush more attractive to you'
she fell suddenly silent again and sat gloomy and staring at the endless procession of gum trees as the train lumbered on through that fantastic forest which made her think of all kinds of ridiculous things
and she was conscious all the time of his furtive watching from the corner opposite and of his readiness to spring forward at the least indication of her wanting anything
it bewildered herthe strangeness of being alone with entirely dependent upon this big man of the bush who had the right to look after her and yet of whom she knew so little
he did look after her with sedulous care
he had natty bush dodges for minimising the discomfort of the hot dusty train journey
he manufactured a windsail outside the carriage window which brought in a little breeze during the airless heat of midday
he contrived to get cool drinks and improvised for her head a cushion out of his rolled up poncho a silk handkerchief and a large cold cabbage leaf against which she leaned her hot forehead
in all his actions she watched him with a curious blend of feelings
there was a satisfaction in his largeness his commonsense his breeziness
she liked hearing his quaint bush colloquialisms when he leaned out of the window at the small stations and exchanged greetings with whomsoever happened to be thereofficials navvies miners even chinamenmost of whom saluted him with a 'glad to see you back sir'
 or a 'goodday boss
good luck to you' as if they all knew the significance of this wedding journeywhich no doubt they all did
bridget kept in the background and smiled enigmatically at it all
she was interested in her husband both in the personal and abstract sense and was a little surprised at herself for being pleased when he paid her any attention or sat down beside her
at moments she even hankered after the touch of his fingers and had a perverse desire to break down the restraint he was so manifestly putting upon himself
once when he had been sitting very still in the further corner thinking she was asleep she had looked at him suddenly and had found his eyes fixed on her in a gaze so concentrated so full of intense longing that she felt as if he were trying to hypnotise her into loving him
she knew that if he were it must be unconscious hypnotism on his part
there were no subtleties of that kind in colin mckeith
no it was the primal element in him that appealed to her dominated her
for she was startled by a sudden realization of that dominant quality in him as applied to herself
in their courtship it had been she who dominated him
he reddened guiltily when he caught her eyes
his long upper lip went down in obstinate resistance to impulse
but if he had kissed her then she would not have rebelled
'colin what are you thinking of'
she said and he answered in a tone husky with pent emotion
'i was thinking of our camp tonightof how we should be alone together in the starlight and of how i want to make you happy and of how wonderful it all islike some impossible dream'
'yes
i've been feeling too that it is like a dream' she replied gravely
'a bit of nightmare so far i'm afraid for you biddy' he said shaking himself free from sentiment
'but this part of it will soon be over'
he got up pulled the blind down behind her and readjusted the cabbage leaf under her head
just then the train pulled up at a station where there were selectors' holdings and a german woman was lugging along a crate of garden produce
he jumped out and bought another cabbage from which he shredded a fresh cool leaf for her pillow
and at that they laughed and he relapsed into normal commonplace
when she got out at fig tree mount he took her across the sandy street to the nearest and largest of the public houses which had 'station hotel' printed on it in big blue lettersa glaring crude zincroofed box with a dirty veranda that seemed a receptacle for rubbish and a lounge for kangaroo dogs to say nothing of drunken men
the dogs took no notice of the male loungers but started a vigorous barking at the sight of a lady
there was the usual bar at one end the usual noise going on inside and the usual groups of bush loafers outside
several riding horses were hitched up to the palings at a right angle with the bar and a bullock dray loaded with woolbaleson the top of which a whole family appeared to reside under a canvas tiltwas drawn up in the road
the beasts were a repulsive sight with whipweals on their panting sides their great heads bowed under the yoke and their slavering tongues protruding
bridget looked at everything with a wide detached gaze as she followed her husband along the hotel veranda
mckeith motioning to his wife to proceed stopped to peer at the faces of two men lying in a drunken sleep on the boards
'not my men anyway' he said rejoining her
'but that will keep'
the place seemed deserted and in disorder
there were glimpses through the open windows of unmade beds within and on the veranda lay some red blankets bundled together
colin took his wife into a parlour where flies buzzed round the remains of a meal and some empty whisky bottles and glasses
after considerable shouting and knocking at doors along the passage he succeeded in arousing the landlady who came in buttoning her blouse
her obviously dyed yellow hair was in a dishevelled state her eyes were heavy and her face sodden
she had evidently been sleeping off the effects of drink
'had a night of it i suppose mrs hurst'
observed mckeith glumly
'this is a nice sort of place to show a lady into'
the woman burst out on the defensive but mckeith silenced her
'that'll do
clear away all that mess and let us have a clean cloth and some tea
and i say if you have got a decent room for my wife to wash the dust off and take a bit of a rest in i'll be obliged'
the landlady blinked her puffed eyelids muttered an uncourteous rejoinder and went off with some of the debris from the table
bridget laughed blankly
she looked so small and flower like so absolutely incongruous with her surroundings that the humour of it all struck mckeith tragically
'good lord
i wonder what your opinion is of this show
here is the beginning of what is called the nevernever country my dear
do you want to go back again to government house'
'no i don't' and she touched him to the heart's core by putting her little hand in his
'that's my mate' said he his blue eyes glistening
'but i'll tell you what i think of your splendid pluck when we're quit of these beastly townships and have gone straight into nature
now i've got to go and see after the buggy and find my boys and i shall have all my work cut out to be ready in an hour
you just make the best of things and if the bedroom is impossible spread out my poncho and take a rest on that sofa there and don't be frightened if you hear any rowdiness going on'
the bedroom was impossible and the sofa seemed equally so
bridget drank the coarse bush tea which the landlady brought in and was glad that the woman seemed too sulky to want to talk
then she sat down at the window and watched the life of the townshipthe diggers slouching in for drinks the riders from the bush who hung up their horses and went into the bar the teams of bullocks coming slowly down the road and drawing up here or at some other of the nineteen public houses 'to wet the wool' in bush vernacular
she counted as many as twentyfour bullocks in one of the teams and watched with interest the family life that went on in the narrow space between the wool bales and the canvas roof above
there were women up there and little children
she saw bedding spread and a baby's clothes fluttering out to dry and tin pannikins and chunks of salt beef slung to the ropes that bound the wool bales together
then when the wool was wetted or when some other teams behind disputed the right of way in lurid terms which lady bridget was now beginning to accept as inevitably concomitant with bullocks the first dray would proceed all the cattle bells jingling and making in the distance not unpleasant music
it was the horses that interested lady bridget most for like all the o'haras she was a born horsewoman
though she was moved almost to tears by the spur scars on the lean sides of some of themspirited creatures in which she recognised the marks of breedingand by the unkempt condition of some that were just from grass she decided within herself that there could never be a lack of interest and excitement in a land where such horseflesh abounded
presently she had her first sight of the typical stockman got up in 'township rig'
spotless moleskins new crimean shirt regulation silk handkerchief red of course and brand new tied in a sailor's knot at the neck leather belt with pouches of every shape and size slung from it tobacco pouch watch pouch knife pouch and what not
cabbage tree hat of intricate plait pushed back to the back of the head and held firm by a thin strap coming down to the upper lip and caught in two gaps on either side of the prominent front teeththere are very few stockmen who have kept all their front teeth
stockwhip out of commission for the present with an elaborately carved and beautifully polished sandalwood handle hanging down behind a long snakelike lash coiled in three loops over the left shoulder
lady bridget knew most of the types of men who have to do with horseshuntsmen trainers jockeys riding masters and the rest but the australian bushrider is a product by itself
she liked this son of the gum foresttanned face taut nerves alert eyes piercing long distancesa man vital shrewd simple as a child cunning as an animal
and the way he sat in his saddle the poise of the lean lanky muscular frame
no wonder the first stockman seemed to the wild blacks a new sort of beast with four legs and two bodies
and the cleanlimbed mettlesome creature under him
man and beast seemed truly a part of each other
lady bridget o'hara's soul warmed to that stockman and to his steed
he was looking at the windows of the barparlour
as soon as he saw the lady the cabbage tree hat was raised in a flourish the horse was reined in the man off his saddle and the bridle hitched to a post
now the stockman stepped on to the veranda
'mrs mckeithor is it lady mckeith i should sayi haven't got the hang of the name if you'll pardon memr mckeith sent me on to say that he'll be here with the buggy in a minute or two
i'm moongarr bill glad to welcome you up the leura ma'am though i expect things seem a bit rough to you straight out from england and not knowing the bush'
lady bridget won moongarr bill's good favour instantly by the look in her eyes and the smile with which she answered him
'i'm from ireland moongarr bill and if we irish know anything we know a good horse and that's a beauty you're riding'
'out of a pitsford mare by a royallieu colt and there's not a finer breed in the nevernever
my word
you've struck it there ma'am and no mistake' responded the stockman enthusiastically
'i bought 'im out of the yard at breeza downsthat's windeatt's run about sixty miles from moongarr and i will say that though it's a sheeprun they've beat us in the breed of their 'osses got 'im cheap because he'd bucked young windeatt off and nearly kicked his brains out and there wasn't a man along the leura that he'd let stop on his back except me and zack duppothe horsebreaker who first put the tackling on 'im'
after the interchange of one or two remarks lady bridget had no doubt of being friends with moongarr bill and moongarr bill decided that for a dashed newchum woman lady bridget had a remarkable knowledge of horseflesh
the quick clopclop of a four horse team and a clatter of tin billys and pannikinsas lady bridget presently discovered slung upon the back rail of an american buggysounded up the street
'there's the boss' said moongarr bill
'look alive with that packhorse wombo'
lady bridget now perceived behind the stockman a black boy on a young colt leading a sturdy fleabitten grey laden with a pack bag on either side
he jumped off as lightly as moongarr bill and hitched his horses also to the veranda posts
except that he was black as a coal save for the whites of his eyes and his gleaming teeth he seemed a grotesque understudy of the stockmanmoleskins not too clean and rubbed and frayed in places fastened up with a strap faded crimean shirt exposing a wealed and tattooed breast old felt hatnot a cabbage treewith a pipe stuck in its greasy band an ancient red silk handkerchief with ragged edges where whip crackers had been torn off round his neck and a short axe slipped among a few old pouches into the strap at his waist
he jumped on to the veranda clicked his teeth in an admiring ejaculation as he gazed at lady bridget
'my word
bujeri feller white mary you
 new feller mithsis belonging to boss
my word'
then as mckeith drew up his horses in front of the hotel wombo and moongarr bill sprang to the heads of wheelers and leaders
it seemed to bridget that there was a change in her husband even since he had left her
he looked more determined more practical wholly absorbed in the unsentimental business of the moment
he had changed into looser more workmanlike rigwas belted pouched carried his whip grandly handled his reins with a royal air of command as if he were now thoroughly at home in his own dominions had already asserted his authoritywhich she found presently to be the caseand intended the rest of the world to knock under to him
there flashed on lady bridget an absurd idea of having been married by proxylike the little princesses of historyand of being now received into her lord's country by the monarch in person
her face was rippling all over with laughter when he joined her in the veranda
'what
another delicious black boy
he looks like a christy minstrel
i thought you hated blacks colin'
'so i do
you've got to have 'em though for stock boys and i keep my heel on the lot at moongarr
wombo and cudgee aren't bad chaps so long as they are kept clear of their tribe
how do you like the new buggy my lady
a dandy gocart eh'
he looked as pleased as a child with a new toy carriage
the buggy was quite a smart bush turnoutcomfortable seats in fronta varnished cover now lying back a well behind filled with luggage a narrow back seat whence cudgeea smaller edition of wombosprang down
cudgee too stared at lady bridget and clicked his teeth in admiration exclaiming  'hullo
new feller mithsis'
afterwards lady bridget remembered the greetings and wondered why the black boys had said 'new feller mithsis'
who had been the old feller mithsis
she asked herself
mckeith sternly quashed the black boys' ebullition and told them to mind their own business
bridget agreed that the buggy was first rate and became enthusiastic over the horses four fairly matched and powerful roans
'oh
what beauties
i'd like to go and make friends with them'
he was delighted
'good 'uns ain't they
but wait and make friends when you're behind 'em
we've twentyfive miles to do before sundown
got your traps fixed up
that's right
here bill take her ladyship's bag and stow it safely at the back of the buggy
handle it gingerlyit's full of silver and glass fallalsnot what we're much used to on the leura'
the stockman grinned and carried the dressingbagone of sir luke's and lady tallant's wedding presentsas if it were dynamite
colin seemed anxious to impress his wife's dignity upon her new subjects
she felt still more like a queen of comic opera
he helped her into her dust cloak paid the bill cut short the landlady's sulky apologiesshe had done her hair and recovered herself a little
then he settled lady bridget into the buggy after the manner of a bush courtierher feet on a footstool the rug over her knees a cushion at her back
his whole air seemed to say  'this is the queen and i the king expect that proper homage be paid her'
chapter    the loafers at the bar all came out to see the start
the family on the top of the bullockdray peered forth from under the tilt
the barkeeper shouted 'good luck to you and your lady mr mckeith'
the drunken reprobates awakened from their slumber on the boards called out too 'gooluksh'
there was an attempt at a cheer but before mckeith had got out his answering 'thank yegood day mates' a shower of opprobrious epithets rained upon him from a little band of discontented bush rowdiesthe advance guard of that same union delegate who had come up with them in the train from leuraville
three of these men lurched on to the bar veranda and so to speak took the stage
in front was a stumpilybuilt bullock driver with a red truculent face a ragged carrotty beard and inflamed narrowridded eyes
a little to the rear stood a lanky muscular bushman in very dirty moleskins with a smooth looselipped face no eyelashes and a scowling forehead who was evidently the worse for drink next to him a shorter man of the drover type older eaglebeaked and with sinister foxy eyes
this one hailed mckeith
'yah
look at him and his spanking team
what price honest labour you blamed scab of a squatter
just you wait a bit
it'll be our turn soon to burn all you blanked capitalists off the leura'
the lanky bushman took up the jeering note
'pretty flash turnout ain't it
my word you think yourself a bloated fine gentleman now you've married into the british hairystocracy don't you mister colin mckeith
you can take it from us boys he's the meanest cuss that ever downed a harmless nigger
ask him what the twentyfive notches on his gun stand for'
'and i tell you what it is steve baines
there'll be another notch on my gun and it won't be for a nigger if you give me any more of your insolence' said mckeith coolly
'get out of the way men
let the horses go cudgee
ready biddy'
but cudgee out of malice or stupidity did not let the roans go or else someone else put a restraining hand on the reins
the man with the ragged beard roared out
'ho you think you're going to ride over usyou and your fine ladyship
wot do we care about the british hairystocracy
what we're asking for is the rights of labour and we mean to have 'em
do you want to know what he's done to us boys
fired us out straight away cos we was 'avin' a bit of a spell and a drink to keep the life in us after we'd close up killed ourselves lifting that there ladyship's blanked hundredton weight of pianner on to the dray'  moongarr bill's chivalrous instinct flamed to a counter attack
he had just mounted but swung down from his saddle and made a rush at the speaker
mckeith's stern voice stopped him
'don't be a fool bill
let the brutes alone and push on with the pack
this is not the time for a row
as for you jim steadboltyou know me and you know that if this was any other sort of occasion you'd pay on the nail for your infernal cheek leave go of those reins
d'ye hear' for the man of the ragged beard was jerking the near leader's bit and putting the mettlesome animal on its haunches
'damn you
let go'
he leaned forward to strike at steadbolt with his riding whip but the lash had caught round the polebar of the buggy and he could not extricate it
bridget tried to help him
he turned to her for an instant a soft gleam of tenderness shining through the steely anger on his face
'no
keep still my dear
don't be frightened'
'i frightened'
she gave a little laugh
her form stiffened
the small pale face poked forward between the folds of her motor veil and all the o'hara spirit flashed as she spoke to the group of malcontents
'how dare you
stand back
i thought australian men were men and that they didn't insult women'
there was an uproar in the veranda and more cries of 'shame steadbolt you
 you just git gumsucker steve
we ain't got no use for you micky phayle can't you see a lady as is a lady'
sounded from the bar and parlour
it was the landlady who asked the last question
the two reprobates who had been asleep lunged off the veranda and made a feeble assault on steadbolt who still clung to the reins
the man lashed to fury by the scorn ringing in lady bridget's voice made a last envenomed attack
'it ain't us genuine australians that insults you takes a mongrel scotchy for that say ladyship just you ask your husband what a sort of an insult he's got ready for you up at his bachelor's quarters at moongarr'
the words had not left his mouth when mckeith's driving whip whizzed in the air and raised blood on the speaker's cheek
steadbolt dropped his hold of the roan leader's bridle and fell back screaming imprecations
at a touch the buggyhorses bounded forward
'sit tight biddy' said her husband
'up you get cudgee' he shouted
the black boy leaped to the backseat and in a moment the buggy swerved by the bullockdray that was drawn up a little further down the road and the excited horses galloped past the nineteen public houses and the zincroofed shanties past the new quarter of tents and whirring machinery past the deserted shafts and desolate mullock heaps then way out along the sandy wheeltrack into the unpopulated bush
for the first mile scarcely a word was exchanged between husband and wife
the horses were fresh and mckeith had enough to do to keep them from bolting
moreover even in emotional phases he was always silent while chewing the cud of his reflections
bridget was thinking too
she had an uneasy sense of startlement without exactly knowing why she felt startled in that inward way
it was as though some great obscene bird of flight had brushed her with its wings and brought vaguely to her consciousness unpleasant possibilities
but presently she became interested in watching colin's handling of the team
she had often sat behind such a team but never beside such a splendid whip
impulsively she made some such remark and he looked down at her the hard face breaking into a smile
'that's good
wait a bit my dear until they've steadied down again y'see they take a lot of driving and i don't want to lay an accident on top of that unholy shindy' he spoke in jerks
the roans were inclined to 'show nasty' as moongarr bill came abreast of them and wombo's pack jingled behind
mckeith gave moongarr bill directions about the camp in bush lingo which again turned bridget's thoughts
the black boy and the stockman spurred on as the roans slackened pace
mckeith was able to relax the strain
'my word
we scooted pretty quick out of that piece of scenery' he said
'i felt downright mad at your being let in for such a disgraceful bit of business
i hadn't time to tell you that i'd sacked those men half an hour before
found them in the lowest of the grog shanties their horses not looked after dray only half loaded and the three of themgumsucker steve was to have come and taken off our leaders when we got into broken countrythick with the union delegates and sticking for higher wages
i paid them off and filled their places on the spot with two chaps off a wooldrive
so i left the brutes vowing vengeance and i suppose they thought they'd lose no time in giving me a taste of it well they're no loss'
he had been explaining things in jerks while he brought the team to an harmonious jogtrot along a piece of uneven road
'that fellow steadbolt is a wrong 'unnot good even at his own job of wood and water joeywhich means my dear the odd cartdriving on a placeand not to be trusted within ten miles of a public house'
lady bridget asked suddenly  'i want to know colinwhat did that man mean by saying you had an insult ready for me at your bachelor's quarters
what insult'
it seemed as though blue fire leaped from mckeith's eyes
'insult
good god
biddy you can't hold me responsible for the foul insinuations of a beast like that
insult you
my wife'
the passionate tenderness thrilling his voice the honest wrath and bewilderment in his face must have silenced any doubt had doubt existed in lady bridget's mind
'i don't know colin
i don't even know what bachelors' quarters mean
have you an army of bachelors at moongarr and what do they do when they're at home'
he laughed
'it's a shanty i put up for the newchums when i've got anyand for the gentlemensundowners that come along and visitors that i don't want to be bothered with at the house
there's a woman up there' he stopped suddenly and his face grew grim again
'that's it i supposei'm sorry i didn't sling the whip harder and cut the fellow's cheek open
i would if i'd thought'
he stopped again
'what woman
have i a rival
this is becoming dramatic'
lady bridget's voice was amusedly ironic but she carried her head erect
'tell me about the woman at the bachelors' quarters colin'
'there's nothing to tell except that's she's the widow of a man who went up with me on my last big bight expedition and was killedpartly through his own and partly through my fault
that's why i've made a point of looking after her and i built my bachelor's quarters chiefly to give her a job
i thought she was too young and too good looking to be drawing grog for diggers at fig tree mountwhich was what she set out doing'
'i see
so she's youngand handsome'
'oh in a coarse sort of way no i wouldn't say that she's rather refined for her upbringing
anyway steadbolt as well as a lot of other men fell in love with hersteadbolt was pretty well off his head over it
she wouldn't have him at any pricenaturallyand i had to give the fellow work outside the headstation to keep him away from her
that was before i went south
very likely he's been trying it on again and knew i should have to get rid of him as soon as i came back'
'why doesn't the woman marry again'
mckeith shrugged
'too jolly comfortable perhapsor perhaps the right man hasn't turned up
florrie hensor is several cuts above a malingering lout like steadbolt
well there poor devil
maybe it's not unnatural that i should feel a sneaking sympathy for an unsuccessful lover
that abominable lie was a bit too strong thoughand before you
the man must have been downright mad from drink and fury and bitterness
itit's all funnyisn't it
one of the queer sides of the bush
good old bush
i am glad to be back in it again biddy'
he lifted his head and seemed to draw in the strong odour of the gum trees and the pure vitality of the weltering sun
his anger appeared to have left only compunction behind it
and again he begged her to forgive him for having subjected her to an experience so disagreeable
they were on a stretch of clear road now and the roans trotted pleasantly along
lady bridget took up his words
'yes it's all funnythat kind of thingin this setting
i never supposed that i should be howled at by a revolutionary mob in the australian bush a bas les aristocrats
it's quite exciting
i think i should have enjoyed the reign of terror'
'eh
you're only frightened of fourfooted beasts
if you'd lived then you'd have gone up to the block with that smile on your lips and the proud turn of your little headjust as i used to dream of you'  'of me'
'you don't knowi'll tell you some day
i remember talking to joan gildea once
it's queer
but never mind now
d'ye like this biddy'
'i love it
i wish we could drive on through the forest all day and all nighta dream drive
i think i might be able to place myself at the end of it'
'to place yourself'
'i've never been able to find my true pivot inside
all my life i've been howling in my soul and haven't known what i was howling for
i thought today that you might teach me'
'is it only today that you have thought that'
he said wistfully
'well anyway i'm glad of it'
'colin' she said abruptly 'wasn't it funking a little bit don't you thinkrunning away'
'nonot with you beside me
you'll have other opportunities for seeing whether i've got much of the funker in me
no doubt those brutes will give trouble some time'
'what can they do'
'fire my runspoil my cattle salesget hold of my stockmenbut i'm not so badly off as my sheep neighbours at breeza downs
they've got to have their shearing done
though i've had a lot of bother today' his face became gloomy 'and i foresee more ahead'
she asked what other sort of trouble
'why
there's been no rain at moongarr since i left it five months ago
and pleuro means innoculation and short sales ah well
'  he flicked the wheelers gently
'shake it up alexander
look alive roxalana
i named 'em when i was reading rollin's ancient history my dear  my dear'
he looked down at the little woman by his side with deep tenderness in his blue eyes and a smile that banished the shade from his face
'oh my dear there ain't going to be any bush worries for us this blessed afternoon and evening
it's the poetry and romance'he pronounced it romance'of the bush that's got hold of me now
i'm just longing for us to strike the camping placeand thenjust you and me togetherjust man and womanalone with nature'
he put his hand on hers and she pressed it in return
the woman in her thrilled to the man in him
cudgee on the hind seat with his back to them broke the spell
'my word massa
you look out mithsisbig feller goanner sit down along a tree'
and for the first time in her existence lady bridget beheld a monster iguana dragging its huge lizard tail and turning its stately brown crocodile head round at her from the safe vantage place of a thick gum branch
after that the way led off the main road on by a less used track through wilder country
here wombo the black boy was waitingmoongarr bill having gone on with the pack horse to the camping placeand helped to unharness the two leaders which he drove before him ahead
the trees thickened the buggy wheels caught on stumps
cudgee had to get down at intervals and with his axe lop and clear fallen timber
every mile the progress grew slower and the forest more lonely
no sign now of a selector's clearing or of any human occupation
but there was a pack of emus hustling and shaking their big bunches of feathers like startled ballet girls
'i feel as if part of the zoo had been let loose' said lady bridget when again there bounded along in the near distance a pair of kangaroos with a little joey kangaroo taking a lesson in locomotion behind its parents
they were still in the gum forest but now and then came a belt of gidia scrubmournful trees with stiff black trunks and grey green foliage and a pale sort of wattle flower smelling like dead cattle when rain is about as mckeith explained
but there was no rain about now and in truth he would have welcomed the unpleasant odour
perhaps it was that which made the ground so stark and bare beneath these trees where no grass will grow
the sun was lowering when they left the gidia
out in the gum forest again the birds were chattering before retiring to rest
all life is still in the bush at midday but now there were curious scutterings among the grass tussocks and the whirr of its insect population sounded all round
the country got prettierswelling pastures and stony pinches and a distant outline of hills
they could see the green line of a water course
'plenty water sit down along a creek'
mckeith asked the black boy
but cudgee shook his woolly head
'ba'al mine think it massa
no rain plenty long time'
ba'althe aboriginal negative
mckeith sighed
the dark shadow of coming drought is a fearsome spectre on the nevernever land
chapter    a cooee sounded long clear vibrant
moongarr bill and wombo who had gone on ahead were fixing camp
lady bridget's musical voice caught up the note
she answered it with another cooee to cudgee's delight
'my word
ba'al newchum that feller white mary' said he
they had rounded a knoll abutting on the green line of titrees and swamp oak
it was a barren hump upon its crest and alone in barbaric majesty stood a row of grass trees silhouetted against the sunset sky
weird sentinels of the bridal camp they seemedtall thick black trunks like palmstems from each of which spread an enormous tuft of gigantic grass blades green and upright in the middle grey and jaggled and drooping where they hung over at the bottom
out of each green heart sprang a great black spear many feet in height
the stony knoll dropped sheer like a wall
on the other side of it was a space the size of an amphitheatre a large part of it spread with soft green grass like a carpet and the rest of the floor scattered with low shrubs and big tussocks
amongst them was a herb giving out a fragrance when the feet crushed it like that of wild thyme
the whole air seemed filled with a blend of aromatic perfumes
here was a roofless room open on one side where a break in the titrees showed the sandy bed of the creek which at first to lady bridget's fancy had the appearance of a broad shallow stream
on this side low rocks with ferns growing in their crannies edged the stream
on the opposite shore one giant eucalyptus stood by itself and cast its shadow across
beyond lay the gumpeopled immensity of the bush
the stony walls of the knoll curving inward and sheltering a thick growth of ferns and scrubby vegetation closed in the bridal chamber
creepers festooned the rocky ledges and crevices
here and there a young sapling slanted forward to greet the morning sun when it should rise behind the hummock
moongarr bill had undone the packbags and was building a fire between two large stones
the flames leaped up the dead twigs crackled
long years after lady bridget could recall vividly the smell of the dry burning gum leavesher first experience of a bush campfire
close to the fire under the flank of the rocky knoll the tent was pitched a roll of blankets and oilskin thrown just within it
presently from the hummock above came the sound of cudgee's axe
he had felled the youngest of the grasstrees and was now chopping off its green tuft
soon he appeared carrying a huge bunch of the coarse blades of foliage which he brought to the tent
with an odd mixture of emotions lady bridget watched her husband take the grass tops from the black boy and spread them carefully on the floor of the tent heaping up and smoothing the mass into a bed upon which he laid the oilskin and then one of the blanketsthey were new white blankets fresh from the store
after that he set the cushions from the buggy covering them with the rug at the head of the couch making a bolster and over that the one she had had at her back
'no down pillows or linen sheets allowed in a bush campout my lady biddy' he said with a laugh a half timorous glance at his wife but her answering smile reassured him
'you'll never sleep on a sweeter bed' he said sniffing the resinous fragrance of the grasstree tops
he would not let her help him with the upper blankets when she wished to lend a hand
'no this camp is my own show
go and look at the scenery until i've got our wigwam in order'
and she submissively obeyed
against the other side of the rock wall the black boys had built a second fire
the horses were hobbled and grazing along the green border of the creek
the buggy propped up was covered with a tarpaulin
the packbags had disgorged their contents
a miscellaneous heap of camp properties lay on the ground
and now cudgee's axe was at work again stripping a section of bark from a gum tree for what purpose lady bridget did not divine
she walked down to the creek and stood among the rocks at its edge
she had expected a rippling stream and to her disappointment saw only a broad strip of dry sand along which moongarr bill was mooching a spade in his hand
'what are we going to do for water'
she exclaimed
'dig for it my ladyship' answered moongarr bill
'that's one of the upsidedown things in 'stralia
here's two of themmighty queer come to think of itthe rivers that run underground and the cherries that grow with their stones outside'
lady bridget observed that she was already acquainted with that oftquoted botanical phenomenon
in her rides around leichardt's town she had been shown and had tasted the disagreeable little orange berry which has a hard green knob at the end of it and is for some ironical reason called a cherry
she also told moongarr bill that in england she had seen a dowser searching for hidden springs by means of a forked hazel twig carried in front of him which pointed downwards where there was water and asked why australians didn't adopt a similar method
at which moongarr bill laughed derisively and said he did not hold with any such hankypanky
'bad luck biddy' mckeith said behind her
'if there had been the proper amount of rain in these last three or four months we'd have had the one thing that's wanting now to make this the ideal camp i've had on the top of my fancya running creek of pure water
but never mindthe water's there though you can't see it that's got it bill'
for already the sand was darkening and moisture was oozing in the hole moongarr bill had been digging and which he widened gradually into a respectable pool of water
when it had settled down all the billies were filled and the horses driven to it whinnying for a drink
lady bridget watched the evening meal being prepared between the two firesonly watched for she was sternly forbidden to set hand to it
'no canned goods nor cooked food' mckeith said were allowed at this layout
moongarr bill was firstclass at frying steak
he himself was going to boil the quartpot tea and would give biddy a demonstration in johnnycakes made bush fashion at their own camp fire
the sheet of bark had been cut into sectionsone subdivided into small squares to serve as plates
the inside looked clean as paint and smelled of mother nature's stillroom
colin mixed the flour and water upon the larger sheet and worked up a stiff dough
he kneaded it slapped it between his broad palms cut it and baked the cakes in the ashes then butter being the only luxury permitted he split them and buttered them and lady bridget found in due time that not even the lightest scotch scones taste better than bush johnnycakes
quart pot tea likewisemade also in true bush fashion
first the boiling of the billycolin's own particular billy battered and blackened from much usagehalf the battle he explained in brewing bush tea
then regulation handfuls of tea and brown store sugar thrown in at the precise boiling moment
now the stirring of the frothing liquid with a fresh gumtwig
then the blending and the cooling of itpouring the beverage from one quart pot into another and finally into the pannikins ready for the drinking
proudly round the rockflank of the hummock moongarr bill brought fried steak and potatoes steaming in a clean tin dish and done to a turn then went to cook more for himself at his own camp
they ate off the bark plates
salt sugar and mustard came out of small ration bags
mckeith produced blackhandled knives and forksthe last a concession
and good to taste were the fizzling johnnycakes and the strong sweet milkless tea
such was lady bridget's real marriage feast
they were hungry yet they dallied over the repast
it was the most delicious food she had ever tasted bridget said
they made little jokes
he was entranced by her happiness
joyously she compared this banquet with others she had eaten in great houses and european restaurants which were the last word in luxury
oh
how she loved the dramatic contrast of it
nature was supreme glorious oh no no
never could she hanker after that which she had left behindfor ever
because if ever she were to go back again to the old life she would be an ugly driedup old woman for whom the smart world would have no further use  then suddenly she became quiet and busied herself in the tent while mckeith took out his pipe and smoked in ruminative bliss
when she came back she had no more talk of contrasts or of her old life no more fantastic outbursts
indeed there seemed to have come over her a mood of sweet sobriety of blushing womanly shyness
'mayn't i be your squaw and help you to wash up'
she said when he collected the tin pots and pannikins and proceeded to get the camp shipshape
no she was not to stir a finger towards the dirty work
it was his job tonight
another campingout time she might play the squaw if she liked
she was not on in this act
he amused her greatly by his tidy bush methods
the billies were refilled the rationbags laid ready for the morning
now darkness had fallen
he put more logs on the fire and the flames blazed up
then he made up a little pile of johnnycakes that he had not buttered and covered it with the bark plates
'we shall have to make an early start and there'll be no time to bake fresh onesand no more use for these things' he said
the square of bark on which he had mixed the dough was in his hands and he was about the fling it among the bushes but she stopped him
'nodon't throw it away
ii want it for a keepsake colin'
he stared at her in surprise
the red flames threw a strange glow on her face and made her eyes look very bright
'my dearest
a sheet of bark'
then a great light broke on him
the strip of bark dropped from his hands
his arms went out and enfolded the small woman lifting her almost from the ground as he crushed her against his breast and kissed her lips with the first passionate lover's kisses he had ever given her 'oh my dearmy sweetheart'
he gave a big tremulous laugh 'there was never any woman in the world like you to think of your caring about just a sheet of bark'
'you made me my first johnnycakes upon it and tonight is the beginning of our married lifeand oh colin it is the first time i have felt really married to you and i want a bit of the bush to remember it by'
he kissed her again
the miracle was accomplished
he seemed to have no words in which to say all that filled his heart
the night sounds of the bush stirred the vast silence
for the first time lady bridget heard the wail of the curlewa long note weirdly melancholy
it startled her out of her husband's arms
there were uncanny swishings of wings in the great gum tree on the other side of the creek
and now the clanking of the horses' hobbles which had been dilatory intermittent became sharply recurrent
a shout from moongarr bill cut short the monotonous corroboree tune which the two black boys had been singing at their camp some little distance away
'my word i believe yarraman break him hobble'
yarramanhorse
at which the boys scampered off through the grass and presently came the cracking of a stock whip among the trees
'it's all right moongarr bill's after them' said mckeith as his bride released herself from his arms
'but if you don't mind darling
i'd better just see if anything has started the beasts'
lady bridget watched him disappear round the knoll
the curlews went on wailing and as if in answer a night owl sent forth his portentous hoothoot
apparently nothing was much amiss with the horses they had quieted down again
lady bridget picked up the strip of bark and carried it in her arms into the tent laughing to herself as she did so
'only a sheet of bark
what a fool i ambut it's quite appropriate anyway'
she put it beside her dressingbag and then went out once more into the night
through the interlacing gum branches she saw a great coppery disk and the moon rose slowly to be a lamp in her bridal chamber
how wonderful the stars were
there was the southern cross with its pointers and the pleiades
and that bright star above the tops of the trees which seemed to throw a distinct ray of light must be venus
the moon was high enough to cast shadowsblackdistorted
the low clumps of shrubs beyond the carpet of grass looked like strange couched beasts  as she stood by the rocks at the creek edge she heard her husband speaking to moongarr bill who seemed to be walking down along the sandy bed
'horses all right bill'
'oh ayjust a possum up a tree gev julius caesar a start been digging a decent bathhole for the ladyship in the morning boss
there's plenty there'
'i wish it was as near the surface at moongarr bill
we shall have our work cut out making new bores if the dry weather lasts'
'my word it's no joke going down three thousand feet
amazing queer the amount of water running underground on this driedup old earth'
'but we can always strike it bill no matter how dried up the outside looks there's the living spring waiting to be tapped
and how's that in human nature too bill
same idea eh'
moongarr bill emitted a harsh grunt
'my best girl chucked me a month back boss and as for your darned sentiment and poetry and sechlikewell i ain't takin' any just at present'
'bad luck bill
struck a deadhead that time eh
well goodnight'
'goodnight bossand good luck to you
i reckon your spring ain't a deadhead anyway say mr mckeith me and the boys are shifting our fire over to the other side of the creek keep the 'osses from hevin' any more of their blessed starts handier for gettin' them up in the morning'

chapter    lady bridget mckeith had been married about a year and a quarter
winter was now merging into spring
but it was not a bounteous spring
that drear spectre of drought hung over the nevernever land
lady bridget stood by the railing of the veranda at moongarr looking out for two expected arrivals at the headstationthat of her husband who had been camping out after cattleand of the mailmancolloquially harry the blowerwho this week was to bring an english mail
perhaps the last arrival seemed to her at the moment most important of the two
the bush wife had long since begun to feel a sort of home sickness for english news
yet had you asked her she would have told you that barbarism still had a greater hold than civilisation
there did not however appear to be much of the barbarian about lady bridget
she still looked like an old picture in the highwaisted teagown of limp yellow silk that she had put on early for dinner and she still trailed wisps of old lace round her slender shoulders
there was the same touzle of curly hair like yellowbrown spun glass or filaments of burnished copper which was shining now in the westering sun
the finelymodelled brows and shadowy eyes were as beautiful as when colin mckeith had first beheld his goddess stepping on to australian earth
but for all that a change had taken place in hera different one from the indefinable yet significant change which is felt in almost every woman after marriage
there is usually in the young wife's face an expression of fulfilment of deepened experiencea certain settled satisfied look
and this was what was lacking in lady bridget's face
the restless soul within seemed to be peering out through hungry eyes
she could see nothing human from the veranda except the bluesmocked figure of fo wung the chinaman at work in his vegetable garden by the lagoon
there was one large waterhole and a succession of small ones connected by watercourses now dry and meandering from a gully which on the eastern side broke the hill against which moongarr headstation was built
the straggling gum forest interspersed with patches of sandalwood and mulga that backed the headstation stopped short at the gully and beyond stretched wolds of melancholy gidia scrub
looking up from the end of the veranda lady bridget could see an irregular line of greybrown boulders jagged and evidently of volcanic origin marking the line of gully
these gave a touch of romantic wildness to the otherwise peaceful scene
lady bridget's gaze went along a track skirting the gidia scrub and crossing the lower end of the gully near the lagoon to the great plain which spread in front of the headstation
except for some green trees by the lagoon a few ragged belts of gum and sandalwood or single isolated trees dotted about the plain was unwooded to the horizon
there were also silhouetted upon the sky the grotesquelooking sails of one or two windmillpumps
in the foreground the plain was intersected by lines of grey fencing within which browsed straggling herds of lean cattle mostly along the curve of the lagoon
neither plain nor lagoon formed altogether pleasing objects of contemplation just now for they spoke eloquently of the threatened drought
when lady bridget had come up a bride the plain had been fairly green
the sandalwood blossoms were out and wild flowers plentiful
the lagoon was then flush with the grass and its water on which white pink and blue lilies floated had reflected the vegetation at its edge
now the lagoon had shrunk and the water in the gully was in places a mere trickle
of course the trees were theretitree flooded gum and so forthbut they looked brown and ragged
one standing by itself a giant white cedar which in spring was a mass of white and mauve bloom and in winter of scarlet berries had a wide strip of brown mud between it and the water that had formerly laved its roots
lady bridget had thought that the rocky gully the lagoon and the vast plain made as pretty a landscape as she had ever seen when she had first looked upon it in the early morn after her homecoming
now as she paced up and down the verandafor she was in a restless moodher mind went back to that bridal homecoming
they had not arrived at the headstation till after dusk but it had been visible from the plain a long way off and she had examined it with ardent curiosity through her fieldglasses in the clear light of sunset
she had seen a collection of rough buildings backed by the forest and from different points of view as they drew nearer had made out that the three principal ones formed three sides of a square
two of thesethe side wingswere old and of primitive constructionslab walls bark roofs and low verandas overgrown with creepers
colin explained that these were the old humpeyas he called the original dwelling houseand the kitchen and store building opposite
lately the new house had been put up at right angles with the old buildings and fronting the plain
it had been begun before his trip south and practically finished during his absence
colin was very proud of the new house
it was made of sawn wood and had a highpitched roof of corrugated zinc turned to gold by the sunset rays upon it
there was a deep veranda all round the new house and it was much taller than the wings being raised on bloodwood piles that had been tarred to keep off white ants and with a flight of wooden steps leading up to the veranda
the details of moongarr headstation became familiar enough later to its new mistress
besides the dwelling houses were various huts and outbuildings
the stockyards lay on a piece of level ground behind at the side of the gully and between the yards and the house stood a small slab and bark cottagethe bachelors' quarters
even though glorified by the sunset it had given lady bridget a little shock to see how crude andarchitecturally speakingunlovely was her new home
but her celtic imagination was stirred by the weirdness of the greygreen gum forest and of the mournful gidia scrub framing the picture
then as dusk crept closer and the great plain along which the tired horses plodded became one illimitable shadow out of which rose strange sounds of beasts and eerie night cries of birds the spell of the wilderness renewed itself and she felt herself enveloped in worldold mystery
she remembered how the lights of the headstation against the forest blackness had looked like welcoming torches and how she had roused herself out of her weariness at the last spurt of the equally weary buggy horses
then the jolt in the dark over the sliprails the slow strain of the wheels up the hill the cracking of moongarr bill's stockwhip and the sound of long drawn cooees
also of dogs barking of men running forward
then how colin had lifted her down and half carried her into the parlour
she remembered her dazed glance round and the rushing thought of how she could soften its ugliness
yet it had looked welcoming
a log fire blazing the table spread a chinese cook in baggy blue garmentspigtail flowing a malay boy her bewildered questionwas there no woman in the establishment
then colin's strident call from the veranda'mrs hensor
where's mrs hensor'
and the appearance presently of florrie hensoryoungish tall a full figure black hair frizzed and puffed a showy face red cheeks redder lips rather sullen flashing dark eyeswho had received lady bridget almost as if she had been her equal and of whom the bride had at once made an enemy by her frigidly haughty response
from the first moment lady bridget had disliked mrs hensor
but she had felt a vague attraction towards the little yellowheaded blueeyed boy clinging to mrs hensor's skirts
as for any uneasiness on the score of steadbolt's insolent insinuations she had absolutely dismissed that from her mind
yesthat bridal homecominghow strange it had seemed
how rough everything was
how impossible the whole thing would have appeared to her had any fortuneteller in bond street prophesied the end of her marriage journey
and how in the first moment of settling down she had laughed with colin at the thought of what chris and molly gaverick and 'eliza countess' would have said
but with what dauntless energy she had worked in transforming her new abode and in making it reflect her own personality
she had felt really grateful she said to the union delegates for having enticed away the builders before the inside furnishings were complete
soon they got hold of a bush carpenter and she was provided with occupation for a good many months
lady bridget had been very happy in those early days
colin had seemed so thoroughly in the picturestrong chivalrous adoringlike a viking worshipping his conquered bride
the romance of it all appealed tremendously to the celtic blood in bridget
it was her nature when she gave to give generously
she had become genuinely in love with her bush husband during that wonderful honeymoon journey
ah that journey
what an experience
if she could have written it down as a new adventure of 'the lady of quality' how the great gibbs would have jumped at her 'copy'
well she had practically done so in her letters to joan gildeanow back in her london flat
but the true inwardness of the adventure was a thing never to be put into words
no sign yet of the men
lady bridget ceased her restless pacing and swung herself slowly to and fro in a hammock at the end of the veranda
as she swung she traversed over again in her imagination the stages of that honeymoon journey
two hundred and twentyfive miles of it after the first camp out
many more nights under the stars
then out of the gum forests they had gone through the great western plains covering ground fairly easily for mckeith had arranged to have fresh horses on the road and they always drove a spare pair ahead of the buggy
occasionally they stopped at a headstation
once at night they pulled up at a bush house and a strange old man had put his head out of a window and shouted to them in the darkness
'if ye've come to see me i'm drunk' he had said 'and if you've come to drink the rumkeg's empty but ye'll find a pint pot outside and a little water in the tank'
and then he had shut the window again and refused further parley
they had camped hungry in the paddockfor provisions had run out and on that account and because the horses had strayed in the night they had to go again to the house
the old man sober and ashamed captivated likewise by lady bridget's beauty and charm apologised almost on his kneeshe made biddy think of thackeray's picture of sir pitt crawley proposing to becky sharp
old mr duppo it wasthe father of zack duppo the horsebreaker who had recently been breaking in colts at moongarr
they stayed till the horses were found
mr duppo had a housekeepernow if mrs hensor had been like that housekeeper there could have been no cause for jealous scandal
an aged dame long bonydressed in a short green petticoat and tartan jacket with a little checked shawl over her head and pinned under a bearded chin
she poured tea out of a tin teapot and leaned over her master's chair at meal times to carve the salt beef
lady bridget sketched the pair
the old man roared over the sketch but the housekeeper bore her a grudge for it and afterwards had not a good word for the 'ladyship' who had slipped out of her proper sphere into the nevernever country
there were plenty of other small adventures which would have made the hair of lady gaverick and her friends stand on end
a dreamdrive indeed full of sort of 'alice in wonderland' episodes
bush life out backa jumble of odd characters and situations
fencers' camps cattledrivers' camps bullockdray camps
there had been a baby born unexpectedly under the tilt of a bullockdray on one occasion the night before mckeith's party appeared on the scene and lady bridget had a trunk down from the buggy and there in the road tore up some of her finelaced smocks and petticoats to provide swaddling clothes for the poor little scrap of mortality
and there were tramps 'humping bluey' on the track likewise and diggers carrying their picks
bridget liked seeing colin hailfellowwellmet with them allsharing tucker and quartpot tea
she wished that her socialistic friends of the old playedout civilisation could see this shrewd practical humanitarian of the bush
they came very close to each other in those long days of the dreamdrive
he talked to her as he had never talked before and as he talked rarely afterwards
he drew aside curtains from recesses of his real nature the existence of which she had not suspected and in truth at a later time doubted
then if in broad sunlight the shy rough exterior of the man would close suddenly over those secret chambers when evening came it would seem as though the camp fire illuminated them once more
after the first time or two he allowed her to boss the camp 'layout'
it was she who spread the blankets on wombo's beds of grass tree tops and dry herbage
wombo and the 'big feller white mary' the adjective used metaphorically as expressive of distinction made great friends in those daysout of which friendship sprang alas
in due time certain tragic happenings
it was lady bridget who would set the billy boiling and who after one or two failures succeeded in making excellent johnnycakes
she remembered her first performance in that line under the eyes of a small group of admiring spectatorsher husband 'just waiting to see how the newchum cook shaped' and as he said the words she glancing up from the sheet of bark and the dough she was kneading caught a look in his face which was something she could never in all her life forget
and moongarr bill with the horses' reins over his arm and the two blackboys agape beady eyes twinkling white teeth glistening emitting their queer guttural clicks of approbation and an occasional 'my word
bujeri you lathychap' the nearest they could get to moongarr bill's accepted form of address
there was joy glory to lady bridget in this playing of the squaw and fending for her man ceasing to be the goddess and becoming the primal woman
and the sports and songs and stories by the camp fire
moongarr bill's yarns colin's exploring tales wombo's and cudgee's dances and corroboreetunesstrange weird music that had a fascination for lady bridget
she too would get up and sing carmen's famous air and the neapolitan peasant songs of her mother's youth
never for sure had the gaunt gum trees echoed back such strains as these
but time came when all the romance of barbarism seemed to have fizzled out and only cruel realities remainedwhen work and worry turned mckeith from the worshipping lover into the roughtongued irritable bushmanwhen his 'hands' deserted him his cattle died and things generally went wrong and when he showed himself something of the hardheaded parsimonious illconditioned scotch mongrel that steadbolt had called him
when indeed he seemed to have forgotten that lady bridget o'hara had graciously permitted him to worship her but had not bargained for being treatedwell as many another outback squattertreats his helpmate
then bridget would tell herself bitterly that it might have been better had she married a civilised gentleman
there would sometimes be scenes and sometimes sulks and those times no doubt accounted for the hungry look in lady bridget's eyes and the slight hardening of her mouth
she was loyal though in spite of her many faults and 'game' in her own wayand when colin came out of his dour moods she was generally ready to meet him half way
for through all the memory of the dreamdrive honeymoon lingered
and the bit of bark sapless brown curled up by the heat into almost a tube and partially eaten by white antsbefore the desecrating assault had been discovered and the termites' nest destroyed with boiling waterwas still cherished as a sacred symbol
while she swung in the hammock the memory pictures came and went like a cinematograph showthe dreamdrive presently merging into an electioneering trip through mckeith's constituency a few weeks after her bridal homecoming
the 'lady of quality' might had she been so minded have also made spicy capital out of the humours of that political contestin which unhappily the labour party had triumphed
steadbolt had had his say on the occasion and there had been a free fightlady bridget was not present and only heard darkly of the occurrencewhen steadbolt had got the worst of it in an encounter with his late employer
but all that was but a small sideshow and not likely to affect in any great measure lady bridget's life
except that the loss of mckeith's seat in the legislative assembly made it no longer necessary for him to spend at least part of the winter session in leichardt's town
nor would lady bridget have the opportunity to resume her old intimacy at government house
in any case however she was not destined to see more of her old friend in australia
a few months previously lady tallant had developed symptoms of grave diseaseit was said that the leichardt's land climate did not agree with her and she had gone back to england leaving sir luke to perform his duties without her help
chapter    at last lady bridget heard the unmistakable sound of cattle in the distancethe low multitudinous roar of lowing beasts and tramping hoofs and the reverberating crack of stockwhips
it came from the gidia scrub
she knew that they had been mustering scrubbersotherwise wild cattle from the broken country at the foot of moongarr range
she left the hammock and went again to the veranda railing
looking along a side path from the chinaman's garden she saw that mrs hensor and her boythe yellowheaded urchin of about sixwere hastening towards the bachelors' quarters
the woman carried a basket of vegetables the boy hugged a big pawpaw fruit which he held up proudly as his mother responded in her freeandeasy rather sulky fashion to lady bridget's stiff nod
'it's for the house' cried the child
'fo wung said i was to bring it up'
lady bridget made a wry faceshe did not like pawpaws
'very well tommy and if you're good you can have what's left tomorrow'
'that's all right' responded tommy in bush formula
'have you seen anything of your masteror the postman'
asked lady bridget of mrs hensor
'i believe mr mckeith is coming on ahead with harry the blower' said mrs hensor
'look sharp tommy the cattle will be at the yard directly and i've got my dinner to cook for the whole lot of them seeing that some visitors aren't good enough for the house'
the woman pointed her last sentence by a malicious glance at the mistress of moongarr
'i suppose that is what your master keeps you here forto cook for the visitors at the quarters mrs hensor' said lady bridget with incisive sweetness
mrs hensor flushed scarlet but she checked an impudent reply
pulling tommy angrily along she hurried up to the fourroomed zincroofed humpey and its leanto kitchen protected by a bough shade which lay between the headstation and the gully with the stockyard close to it and which constituted her domain
it annoyed mrs hensor to hear mckeith called her master
she always spoke of her late husband as having been the bossmate on thatto him fatalexploring expedition
also she resented having all the bachelors 'dumped down'as she phrased iton her while the 'ladyship's swell staff' was spared the trouble
at present the bachelors' quarters was fairly full
mr ninnis storekeeper and overseer in the owner's absence abode there permanently and just now there were zack duppo the horsebreaker and a young man from breeza downsa combined cattle and sheep station about fifty miles distantwho had come to help in the mustering and to collect any beasts strayed from the breeza downs' herd
the gully crossing lay below the boulders of rock at the head of the lagoon
presently two horsemen appeared on the rise
one was mckeith the other harry the mailmanotherwise the blowera foxy brownyred little man on a rawboned chestnut carrying his mailbags strapped in front and at the side of his saddle
lady bridget supposed they had met at the turnoff track just above the crossing
mckeith was carrying a leather mailbag from which he appeared to have extracted a bundle of letters with one hand
he held his bridle and coiled stockwhip in the other
he was listening to the mailman who seemed to be talking animatedly
as they neared the house he gave the usual cooee that set all the dogs barking and put the chinamancook and blackboys on the alert
the riders passed by the end of the veranda where lady bridget stood
mckeith looked up at her
he seemed preoccupied and angry and merely nodded to his wife but did not take off his hat as he had done in earlier daysand somehow today she noticed the omission
'all right eh biddy'
he called out casually
'here's your maili've taken out mine' and he pitched the leather bag with the string cut and the official red seal broken on to the veranda at her feet
'i sayyou might bring the whisky out to the back veranda
i daresay you could do with a nip eh harry'
'that i can mr mckeith
riding along these plains is dry work
good day ladyship
i'm a bit behind time but i lost an hour looking for a hole to fill my water bag atand then i could not drink out of itfor a demed old pleuro bullock had got there first and died in it
my word boss you'll be in a fix if it don't rain before long'
mckeith made an angry gesture
he spoke sharply to the horses
the two men rode round the kitchenwing and dismounted at the paling fence which made the fourth side of the little square
the back veranda of the new house with steps ascending to it in the middle the old humpey with its veranda along one side the kitchen and store building along the other and a rough slab and bark outhouse beyond it
nativecucumber vines and other creepers partially closed in the older verandas
in the centre of the square was a small flower bed with a flowering shrub in the middle
lady bridget brought the whisky decanter from the dining room to the back veranda and mckeith mounted the steps the mailman remaining beside them
a canvas waterbag oozing moisture hung from the rafters and there were tumblers on a table beneath it
mckeith took the decanter from his wife's hand too preoccupied it seemed even to notice the little satirical smile on her lips
she was thinking how funny it seemed that she should be playing hebe to harry the blower
she soon realised however that serious things had happened
as mckeith mixed a liberal allowance of whisky with water from the waterbag and handed it to the mailman he asked curtly  'this isn't one of your blowing yarns harry
you're positive about the fact'
'saw the thing with my own eyes boss
as fine a team as ever i'd wish to own lying with their throats cut and the trees black with crows all round
there was the drayload all turned over and two cases prized open
i bet that the rumkegs and spirits that couldn't be carried off are buried in some handy dry waterhole close by
i saw two or three empty brandy bottles with the heads of 'em smashed to show that the rascals had wet the wool before starting off'
mckeith cursed in his throat
'no sign of my men'
'scooted clean out of the scenerythe whole lot
i reckon that's what they shook hands on with the union chaps and that the natural consequences of absorbing your grog will be another woolshed or two burned down before long
here's your health boss and the ladyship's'
and the mailman gulped down his 'nobbler' and turned to remount the lean chestnut which was standing hitched to the palings observing cheerfully  'well so long sir
go'day ma'am
this sort of argufying ain't going to carry my mailbags along the river'
'go up to the quarters and ask mrs hensor for a feed' called mckeith
'and look here harry you can tell them at the myall creek outstation as you go by to have two good horses ready in the yard for me
i'm off to tunumburra to put the police on to those devils straight away'
'all right boss
you'll find it will take some tall calculatin' though
them unionists are getting too strong for the police to tackle
windeatt up at breeza downs is in a mortal funk and sending word everywhere for a squad of specials to protect his woolshed'
'it seems' said lady biddy to her husband when the mailman had gone 'that there might be some use after all for luke tallant's maxims'
'it seems that jim steadbolt has been taking his revenge' he answered 'and that i must be in the saddle in an hour's time
mix me a drink biddy and order in some grub while i go and have a bath'
he looked as if he needed one
the dust of the drafting camp was caked upon his face and clothes
his was the appearance of a man who had been riding hard after stock and sleeping between his blankets only under the stars
lady bridget mixed him his drink and went to see chen sing in the kitchen
when she came back colin was in the front veranda
he had tumbled the rest of the letters and papers out of the mailbag and was hastily and eagerly scanning the last leichardt's town chronicle
'any news colin'
'i don't know i was looking to see if the government were going to act against the strikersi see they are sending troops'
'and is luke tallant coming at the head of them in official uniform to read the riot actif there is a riot act in australia
i'd like to see luke maintaining the supremacy of the british crown on the leura'
he looked up at her in vague rebuke of her levity and there was suppressed tenderness in his eyes notwithstanding his preoccupation with his own troubles
'no no
but there's something in the paper about lady tallant being ill and having an operation
poor chap
he wouldn't have been bothering much about strikes in the nevernever and the supremacy of the british crown any more than i should in similar circumstances well there
i must go and bogey'
bogeyin black's language 'bathe out of doors'  sudden compunction overswept bridget
'oh colin
you would care really even though they had cut the throats of your four best drayhorses'
but he had disappeared into a little veranda room against which a corrugated iron tank backed conveniently and in a minute she heard the splash of water
she picked up the paper and looked at the english intelligence before examining her own letters
it was quite true
there was a paragraph stating that lady tallant's health had not improved since her arrival in england and hinting at the likelihood of an operation being advisable
bridget reflected however that sir luke would probably have received a cablegram by this time one way or otherwhich would have put him out of suspense and presumably there had been no later bad news
a letter from molly gaverick confirmed that item of the english intelligence
rosamond tallant's condition was certainly far from satisfactory
molly however seemed much more taken up with a recent illness of eliza countess of gaverick than with that of lady tallant
being a tactless and absolutely frank young person she had no scruple in proclaiming her hope that 'old eliza' would make lord gaverick her heir
this was the more likely wrote young lady gaverick because the old lady had lately quarrelled with her own relatives and never now asked any of her stuffy provincial cousins to share the dulness of castle gaverick and of the house in brook street
if she did not leave her money to chris gaverick there was not conceivably anyone else to whom she would leave it
'by the way' molly continued as if it had been an afterthought 'old eliza is immensely interested in you and your cowboy husbandranchowner is what i suppose i ought to call him
she asked mrs gildea so many questions about you both that joan read her your account of your honeymoon journey through the bush and all the rest of it
how you can endure such a life is incomprehensible to mebut aunt eliza says it shows you've got some grit in you and that evidently your husband has cured you of a lot of ridiculous nonsensei am quoting her so don't be offended and you needn't show this to nature's gentleman which is what aunt eliza calls him
i can't help feeling though that it's rather a pity you didn't wait a bit before taking the irrevocable step
i don't know whether you ever heard about mrs willougby maule's deatheleven months after their marriage'
no bridget had not heard
molly gaverick was an uncertain correspondent and no doubt joan gildea and rosamond tallant if they had known of the event had thought it wiser in writing to her to suppress the news
for a moment lady bridget sat meditating and all the blood seemed to rush from her brain to her heartshe could almost hear her heart pounding
then she went on again with lady gaverick's letter
'it was a motor accidentnothing serious at the time but the baby was born prematurely and she lingered a week or two and then died
i must do him the justice to say that he seemed to feel her death very much
it looked as though after all the marriage had been quite a success
her money gave him a lift and they were going out a good deal in the political set
she left her quarter of a million to him absolutely
i heard that some remote bagallys were going to contest the will but they found that they hadn't a leg to stand upon
i wish now that we hadn't been so sniffy about wm
as chris observed with unconscious cynicism there's a good deal of difference between a penniless adventurer and the possessor of quarter of a million
unattached men with money can be so useful
as soon as rosamond tallant gets betterif she doesi'll make her ask him to meet us
i know he used to be a great friend of luke's'     chapter    lady bridget had read so far when the door of the bathroom opened and mckeith came out clean again in fresh riding gear and with a valise ready packed and strapped in his hand
the noise of the cattle became much louder though the mob was not yet in sight
'i wish i hadn't got to go off before the branding' he said
'these breeza downs people always want to claim every cleanskin
you might tell ninnis and moongarr bill biddy to keep a sharp lookout
and now let me have my grubi'm sorry dear to have you hurry up your dinner'
he strode along to the diningroom too absorbed in his own annoyances to notice his wife's face or to ask any questions about her letters
cleanskinunbranded calf  lady bridget gathered them up and followed him
the malay boy waited at table with the assistance of a servant girl from leuraville the only female domesticwith the exception of mrs hensoron the headstation
mckeith swallowed his soup and ate the savoury stew prepared by the chinese cook with the appetite of a man who had been all day in the saddle
lady bridget who was an extraordinarily rapid eater as well as a fastidious one had finished long before he was halfway through
she sat silent at first while he growled over the outrage upon the horses
then suddenly visualising the poor beasts lying stiff in congealed blood and the mailman's exaggerated description of trees black with crows she flamed out in wrathful horror and was as anxious as her husband that the perpetrators of the crime should be brought to justice
he seemed pleased and a little surprised at the ebullition
'i thought you weren't taking it quite in biddy
i am glad you think like me though i expect yours is the humanitarian view and mine's the practical one
this touches my pocket you see
well anyway you won't be so keen now on defending the unionists'
'i think they've got as much right to fight for their principles as we have for ours but i don't think they've the right to torture horses' she rejoined
her sympathy with oppressed shearers and dispossessed natives struck always a jarring note between them
his long upper lip closed tightly on the lower one and he hunched his great shoulders
'well that sort of argufying won't muster the cattle' he observed drily plagiarising harry the blower
she changed the subject
'did you have a good muster'
'oh fair
between three and four hundred head
the water is running still up in the range
we should have done better if that skunk wombo hadn't bolted'
lady bridget leaned forward with interest
'oh
then he has gone after the blackgin
brave wombo'
'i wouldn't care a cuss whether he went after the blackgin or not she's a halfcaste by the way and all the worse for that
and he might stop with her if it wasn't that he knows the country and can spot the gullies where the cattle hide
i've no use for sentimentespecially black sentimentwhen it's a case of a forced sale to keep me going
my heavens
there's only one thing biddy that could break me and it's drought
i believe we're in for a long one and unless i can make sales quickly and get money to sink new bores on the run things will go hardly with me
harry the blower spoke naked truth for once in his life'
'oh
but there's sure to be rain soon
it looked so like it last night' she answered lightly
'looked so like it
yes and ended in wind and dust
sure sign of drought
i must be off
here give me the leichardt land chronicle and don't expect me till you see me and by the way biddy i hear there's a unionist organiser going the round of the stations and pretending to parley with the masters
don't you be philanthropic enough to let him open his jawsi've told ninnis he's to be hounded off before he has time to get off his saddle'
'colin you are unjust all round
you were very unjust to wombo
why shouldn't the poor blackboy marry as well as you or anyone else'
mckeith gave a hard laugh
'i'm not preventing him from marrying
i only said i wasn't going to have his gin on my station'
'you wouldn't listen when he told you that he didn't dare go back to his tribebecause his gin's husband threatened to kill him'
'my sympathies are with the gin's husband
what business has wombo to steal another man's wife'
'the husband broke her head with a nullanulla and she loves wombo and wombo loves her
i consider that any woman whether she's black or white who lives with her husband while she loves another man is committing a sin' said lady bridget hotly
mckeith stopped in the act of filling his tobacco pouch from a jar on the mantelpiece and looked sharply at his wife
'you think that biddy
i remember long ago you said something of that sort to me
it isn't my idea of morality or of justice
but i'm one with you this far
if i'd ever reason to believe that you loved another man and wanted to go off with himyou might goi wouldn't put out a hand to stop you
and then'  'and then'
she had grown very white
'well i think i'd make another notch in my gun firstand it would be a previous onefor myself that time'
'no you wouldn't colin
because you know i shouldn't be worth itand you are not the man to funk'
'i'm not
but where you come ingood lord
mate
what would there be left for me to live for'
her heart thrilled to the old term of endearment to which in their early honeymoon days she had attached a sentimental value
of late it had fallen into disuse and when she had heard him on occasions greet the foreman may be of some stray party of drivers or surveyors with the bush formula 'good day mate'
she had felt with deep aggrievement that she no longer desired the appellative
she had not yet realised that while the word 'mate' in australese like the verb aimer in french may be used as a mere colloquial term it implies in the deeper sense a sanctity of relation upon which hangs the whole code of bush chivalry
'oh colin'
her eyes glistened with tears
she felt ashamed of her neurotic fancies and her resentment of his lacks in the matter of conventional courtesiesof his outward hardness his want of sympathy with her ideals
he came to her taking her two hands while keeping his pipe in one of his own so that the whiff of the coarse 'storecut' tobacco made her wrinkle her nose and stemmed the tide of emotion
but he did not seem to notice this
'no you're not going to put that theory into practice mate
i'm not afraid
so we'll leave it at that
and now what's this about the blackboy to do with my being unjust to that organiser
there's no beastly sentiment in his case
he's out to make money that's all'
'you won't hear what he's got to put forward on his side any more than you would listen to poor wombo'
'no i won't
i'm not taking anyeither in gins or in organisers
let 'em show their faces here and they'll pretty soon become aware of the fact'
lady bridget took away her hands and moved to the veranda
outside mckeith's horse was waiting
he strapped on his valise finished ramming the tobacco into his pipe then going behind his wife bent downward and hastily kissed her cheek
she did not turn her head
'goodbye biddy
don't you go worrying over the blacks or the unionists
and if you're dull and want a job there'll be a spice of excitement in helping to tail that mob of scrubbers
i had to hire two stray chaps we're so shorthanded'
he went down the steps to the outer paling
still she made no response though now she turned and watched him vault into the saddle
she also saw his face lighten at sight of mrs hensor's boy with the great pawpaw apple
tommy hensor was a favourite with the boss
'bless you boy it's as big as yourself
take it back to the quarters and tell your mother to give you a slice or perhaps her ladyship will cut it for you'
he trotted off in the direction of the gully and of the roar of cattle
lady bridget could see the heaving backs of the mob and could hear the shouts of the stockmen as they rounded the beasts to the crossing
tommy hensor looked up pleadingly to her holding out the pawpaw apple
his yellow hair flamed to gold in the sunset his blue eyes were as bright almost as colin's
lady bridget shook her head
'no i don't want you this evening tommy
take that back to your mother'
she settled herself in the hammock and read molly gaverick's letter over again
then she read one from joan gildea
joan was in the full swing of london journalism again
she gave bridget rather fuller news of eliza countess of gaverick and dwelt at some length upon the old lady's interest in bridget's wild life and in bridget's husband
'you may be sure' wrote joan 'that i had nothing but good to say of colin and oh
biddy dearest how rejoiced i am to know that he is making you so happy
i could read between the lines of all your amusing descriptions and sketches of the dreamdrive
i had my doubts and my fears as i never concealed from you but i believe that you have found the true wellbeloved at last'
there was a good deal too in the letter about rosamond tallant who was in cheerful spirits it seemed in spite of the impending operation and would not hear of sir luke's asking for leave to be with herand so onand so on
not a word about willoughby maule and his bereavementwhich after all could not be so very recent
why had joan never mentioned it
was she afraid of rousing regret and of awakening painful memories
 cleanskinunbranded calf
chapter    mckeith's absence was longer than he had expected
lady bridget heard from harry the blower on his return round with the downgoing mails that the little bush township of tunumburra had become the scene of a convocation of pastoralists called to concert measures against the threatened strike
the mailman reported that the district was now in a state of great commotion and the strikers gathering silently in armed force prepared to defend their rights against a number of free labourers whom the sheepowners were importing from the south
the men who had killed mckeith's horses were according to the mailman entrenched in the range awaiting developments
it was thought that nothing would happen on a large scale until the arrival of the free labourers and the troops which it was said the government was sending
harry the blower talked darkly of marauding bands ambushed foes and perilous encounters on his road all of which waxed in number and bloodthirstiness after the manner of falstaff's men in buckram
but nobody ever took harry the blower's yarns very seriously
it would have been natural for lady bridget to work herself up into a state of humanitarian excitementthe o'hara's had always espoused unpopular causesbut since the arrival of the english mail a curious dreaminess had come upon her
she spent idle hours in the hammock on the veranda and would only rouse herself spasmodically to some trivial burst of energyperhaps a boiling water skirmish against white ants or a sudden fit of gardeningplanting seeds training the wild cucumber vines upon the veranda posts or watering the shrubs and flowers within the rough paling fence that enclosed the house and garden
a newmade garden for ornament rather than for use for the staple produce was grown in the chinaman's garden by the lagoon
young passionfruit vines barely concealing the fences' nakedness a mango a few small orange trees now in flower
a brazilian cherry two or three flatstone peach trees and loquetsall looking thirsty for rainthat was all
the old humpey as it was called had creepers overgrowing its roof a nestingplace for frogs lizards snakesand lady bridget brave enough for doughty deeds could never overcome her terror of horned beasts and reptiles
mckeith's office where he entered branding tallies and posted the station log was in the old humpey and two or three bachelor bedrooms opposite the wing with kitchen and store
but lady bridget lived chiefly in the new houseless picturesque with its zinc roofing and deficiency of green drapings but being built on sawn lengths of saplings more or less fortified against snakes
in front there was a great vacant space between the ground and the floor of the housepleasant enough in summer when a gentle draught could find its way through the cracks between the boards but cold in winter though the northern winters were not sharp enough or long enough for this to be a serious discomfort
nor when lady bridget slept alone in the new house did she mind much the dogs and harmless animals that couched under the boards they gave her a sense of companionship
but there was a herd of goatssome of them old and with big tough hornswhich mckeith had started in his bachelor days to provide milk when as sometimes happened the milch cows failed also to furnish savoury messes of kid's flesha pleasant change from the eternal salt beef varied with wild duck
occasionally it happened especially in mustering times that nobody remembered to pen the goats in their yard by the lagoon and on these occasions they would get under the house and the noise of their horns knocking against the floor of her bedroom would so effectively destroy lady bridget's chances of sleep that she would rise in the night and drive them into their fold
these were incidents which added variety to the monotony of her life in the bush
the headstation was very quiet one afternoon most of the hands being out with the tailing mob and lady bridget in a restless mood went for a roam through the bush
she walked past the chinamen's garden and fo wung carrying up buckets of water to his young cabbages stopped to smile blandly and report on his produce
but she was in no mood for the interchange of remarks in pidgin english
it was lonelier at the head of the lagoon
she could hear the trumpeter geese tuning up in shrill cornetlike notes and the discordant shriek of nativecompanions as the longlegged grey birds stalked consequentially at the water's edge
she disturbed a flock of parrots in the white cedar tree and a covey of duck rose with a whirring of pinions and a mighty quacking shaking the drips off their plumage so that they glittered like diamonds in the sun
from the limbs of the dead gum tree hung flying foxes their batlike wings extended limply and a gigantic crane stood in melancholy reflection upon one leg
lady bridget crossed the gully and roamed the borders of the gidia scrub
here in an occasional open patch were wattles breaking into yellow bloom and sandalwood trees already in blossom scenting the air faintly and making bright splashes upon the grey and black background of the mournful gidia
she filled her arms with flowers and wandered on long past the stockyards into the fastnesses of the gully where lay dark pools almost empty now and where grey volcanic looking rocks seemed to make a rampart between the scrub and the headstation
she was sitting there her back against a boulder the forest behind her so motionless that inquisitive bowerbirds and leatherheads came quite close to her feet her small pointed chin poked forward her eyes shadowy and mysterious as the still waterpools below
she was visioning in space that man who had once undoubtedly cast a strong spell upon her
the spell had been broken by his own infidelityif it were infidelity of the real man
for she could never believe that he had not truly loved her
broken secondly by the counteracting influence of her husband
but now it seemed that the news of him in lady gaverick's letter had started the old vibrations afresh
it was as if an iron wall between them had suddenly been knocked down and he had gained access to her inner self
for months she had scarcely thought of him
last night she had seen him in a dream and he had spoken to her
he had said 'of course i loved you
i never loved anyone better but i felt that you were not of an accommodating dispositionthat i could not give you anything you really wanted and that we should not be happy together'
that was all of the dream she had brought back
but she knew that there had been a great deal more
the impression had been so vivid that she could not rid herself of the fancy that he was within actual reach of her
it was impossible to imagine him fourteen thousand miles distant
she did not try now to fight against this haunting but yielded herself to the power of the dream
when she heard a footstep in the forest behind her she started and turned and stared into the dim aisles of the gidia as though she expected to see his ghost
'mithsismithsisme womboplenty my been look out for you
plenty mine frightened to go along a headstation'
lady bridget laughed hysterically
what a contrast between the romantic hero of her dreams and the figure of the blackboy before her
wombo had been in the wars
very little was left of the trim understudy of moongarr bill
he was hatless his crimean shirt was torn into ribbons his moleskin breeches were covered with blood and dirt the strap belt with its sheathknife and various pouches was gone and this judging from the state of his legs and feet had been forcibly removed
a gash from a tomahawk disfigured his head the woolly hair was matted with blood
but there remained still something of the preux chevalier about wombo
'mine bring it gin belonging to me' he announced with dignity making an introductory gesture towards what appeared almost an excresence upon the black trunk of a gidia tree except for an old red blanket slung round one shoulder which only half covered a woman's dusky form
'that oola
mine want 'im marry oola
black teller belonging to that feller plenty coolla
my been sneak camp
me catch 'em oola
black feller look out throw 'im tomahawk nullanulla

big feller fight

ba'al can pull out spear oola plenty cry'
coollain blacks language meaning angry
nullanullaa black's weapon
yanto go away
mumkullto kill
ba'alnonot
oola joined in with the black's plaintive wail
'yucke
poor fellow oola'
yuckealas
wombo pulled her forward
a comely halfcaste who as a child had been partially civilised by a stockman's wife on one of the leura outstations but who had later gone back to her tribe and married a myall as the wild blacks are called
she was very young soft and round of outline with hair straighter and more glossy than is usual among her kind and large black eyes now raining tears
she wiped them away with a sooty hand pink in the palm
her left arm hung limp by her side
lady bridget jumped to her feet all concern
'oh you poor thing
you poor poor thing' she cried
for wombo tweaking aside the concealing blanket showed the smooth shaft of a spear transfixed in the quivering flesh of oola's arm above the elbow
he had broken off the long end of the spear to expedite their flightso he explained in his queer lingobut oola had cried so much that he had not been able to draw out the rest of the shaft
'bujeri you white mary'
pleaded oola in the native formula
'you gib it medsin you gib it one old fellow skirt ba'al oola got 'im clothes ba'al got 'im ration plenty sick this feller' and she beat her breast with the arm that was unhurt
bujerivery good
'of course i'll give you medicineand food and i'll look out something for you to put on
only for heaven's sake stop crying' said lady bridget
'come along
you must have that spear pulled out and your arm seen to
come with me to the humpey
quickmurra make haste'
murra make hasteto run quickly
but wombo drew back casting an affrighted glance down the gully towards the crossing
'ba'al me go longa humpeyi believe boss phopho oola' he said
phophoto shoot
'wombo you are foolish
what for boss shoot oola'
'yowii believe when boss say phopho my word
that one phopho
plenty black feller frightened'
yowiyes
bridget pushed the unhappy gin along the track
'you needn't be frightened
boss has gone away'
'boss no sit down longa humpey'
wombo looked relieved and while bridget reassured him the three moved on towards the crossing
in answer to lady bridget's questioning the blackboy told his story as they went
she already knew of wombo's passion for the young gin who was within the prohibited degree of relationship therefore tabu to him and who moreover was already legitimately wedded to a warrior of the tribe
she knew also that mckeith had forbidden the blackboy under pain of severe penalty to seek the coveted bride
of course it was all nonsense about his shooting the poor creature though no doubt in ordinary circumstances he would have sent them off the station
but hard as he wasand lady bridget had learned that her husband could be very hard he would never be inhuman and naturally oola's wound must be dressed
lady bridget hurried them over the crossing and up the hill
the white men were all out with the cattle
she needed assistance and seeing mrs hensor at the kitchen window of the bachelors' quarters called to her
'please come out at once i want you'
the woman's face became sullen on the instant
'i can't come now
i'm in the middle of my baking'
'but don't you see
the thing is important
this poor gin has a spear through her armit must be attended to immediately
wombo is hurt too
the wounds must be washed and dressed look at the poor creatures'
mrs hensor contemptuously surveyed wombo and his erring partner
'serve them right
he's stolen her from her husband and the blacks have given them what for
they don't need any fussing over these niggers
they are used to being knocked about'
lady bridget's eyes blazed but her tone was icy
'i suppose you understand that i've given you my orders to attend to a wounded fellowcreature'
'well i don't call blacks fellowcreatures
do you suppose we should not all be having spears thrown at us if the niggers weren't afraid of mr mckeith's gun'
'you have my orders' repeated lady bridget sharply her wrath at white heat
'i take no orders from anybody but the boss and his orders were that if wombo brought the gin here they'd got to be driven off' retorted mrs hensor
'they will not be driven off
you will answer to your master for this disobedience'
said lady bridget
mrs hensor laughed insolently
'oh i'm not afraid of mr mckeith finding fault with me' and she withdrew out of sight into the kitchen
chapter    lady bridget made as dignified a retreat as was possible in the circumstances
she could have slain mrs hensor at that moment
she took the blacks to the veranda of the old humpey and went to look in the office for antiseptics lint and bandages
chen sing the chinese cook came at her call and rendered assistance with the bland phlegm of his race
the spear had been pulled out of oola's arm by the time lady bridget came back with the dressings
in her spasms of east end philanthropy she had learned the first principles of surgical aid
when oola's arm and wombo's gashed head had been washed and bandaged the trouble was to know what to do with the pair
now that they were comfortable and out of pain fed and given tobacco to smoke and a tot of rum apiece they had time to remember superstitious fears kept at bay while they had been running for their life
both were afraid to show themselves in the open
on one hand there was the terror of mckeith on the other of oola's husband
lady bridget gathered that oola's husband was a medicine man and that he had 'pointed a bone at his faithless wife and her lover'
to 'point a bone' at an enemythe bone having first been smeared with human blood and subjected to magical incantationsis the worst spell that one aboriginal can cast upon another
it means death or the direst misfortune
all that the afflicted one can do is to flyto hide himself beyond the sorcerer's ken and the reach of pursuit
for this reason wombo and oola had fled back to moongarr
no outside black dared venture within range of mckeith's gun
now wombo and oola besought bridget to hide them from the vengeful furies
there was that slab and bark hut at the end of the kitchen and store wing
nobody was likely at present to want to go into it
the door had a padlock and it was used as a storehouse for the hides of beasts that had been killed for the sake of the skins when in the last stage of pleuro
the key was always kept hung up in mckeith's office
here lady bridget installed wombo and oola
she brought them cooked meat bread and a ration of tea and sugar provided them with a pair of blankets and found for wombo some old moleskins a shirt and a pair of boots while oola almost forgot the medicine man's evil spell in her puzzled delight over a lacey undergarment and a discarded kimono dressinggrown which had been part of lady bridget's trousseau
that excitement over the lonely mistress of moongarr went back to her own habitation
she ate her solitary dinner and paced the veranda till darkness fell and the haunted loneliness became an almost unbearable oppression
vast plains distant ranges gidia scrub and the far horizon melted into an illimitable shadow
the world seemed boundless as the starry skyand yet she was in prison
she had longed for the freedom of the wild and her life was more circumscribed than ever
a phrase in an australian poem that had struck her when she had read it not long ago came back upon her with poignant meaning
'eucalyptic cloisterdom'that was the phrase and it was this to which she had condemned herself
the gum trees enclosed for her one immense cell and she had become utterly weary of her mental and her spiritual incarceration
oh
for the sting of love's strong emotion to break the monotony
the most sordid sights and sounds of london streets the most inane babble of a fashionable crowd would be more stimulating to her brain sweeter in her ears than the arid expanse the weird bush noiseshowl of dingoes wail of curlews lowing of cattlethat a year ago had seemed so eerily fascinating
even her marriage
the romance of it had faded as it were into the dull drab of withered gum leaves
the charm of primal conditions had been overpowered by their discomfort
nature had never intended her for the wife of a backwoodsman
at times she felt an almost unendurable craving for the ordinary luxuries of civilisation
the bathing appliances hereor rather the lack of themwere often positive torture to her
she hated the foodcontinual coarse beef varied by stringy goats' flesh or game from the lagoon
she had come to loathe wild duckwhen the men had time to shoot it
she could never bring herself to destroy harmless creatures and was a rank coward over firearms
talk of the simple life
why it was only since they had got fo wung that there had been any vegetables
and the climatethough the short winter had been pleasant enough as a wholewas abominable
the long summer heat the flies and the mosquitoes
what had she not suffered the first summer after her marriage
and now the hot weather was coming again
that was not the root of the trouble howeverbridget was honest enough to confess it
the root lay in herselfin her own instability of purpose her mercurial temperament
she had been born with that temperament
all the o'haras loved changehungered after strong sensation
she was spoiling now for emotional excitement
well the little human drama of the blacks' camp had taken her out of herself for an hour or two
it had been so funny to see oola stroking the lace frills of lady bridget's old petticoat and looking up at wombo with frank coquetry as she mimicked the 'white mary's' gestures and gait
lady bridget meant to stand by the savage lovers
she would not allow colin to treat them badly when he came back
ninnis the overseer broke upon her restless meditations
he was a rough specimen originally raised in texas who after knocking about in his youth as a cowboy in the two americas had come to australia about fifteen years previously had 'freeselected' disastrously and during the last five years had been in mckeith's employ
he was devoted to his master but he looked upon mckeith's marriage as a pernicious investment
his republican upbringing could not stomach the 'ladyship' and he persisted in calling lady bridget mrs mckeith
he considered her flighty and extravagant in her ideas and was always divided between unwilling fascination and grumpy disapproval
tonight he was in the latter mood and this incensed lady bridget
'i've been writing up the log' he began in a surly aggressive tone 'and i thought i'd better make a note of wombo and that gin having come to the headstation in case of there being trouble with the blacks'
'why should there be trouble with the blacks'
she asked in manner equally unconciliatory
'well ye knowthough i daresay it wouldn't seem of much consequence to youwombo's gone agen the laws of the tribe and that's a serious matter
if they know he's skulking here under protection they'll be spearing the cattle and the boss won't like that'
'i'll explain to mr mckeith' said lady bridget haughtily
'well i reckon it's best not to keep them on the headstation against the boss's orders' persisted ninnis
lady bridget set her little white teeth
'naturally mr mckeith's orders don't apply to meas i had to tell mrs hensor'
'mrs hensor knows the boss better than most people' said ninnis at which lady bridget flashed out
'we need not discuss that question mr ninnis'
ninnis' jaw stiffened underneath his shaggy goatee
'well i guess you know your own business mrs mckeith and it's up to you to square things with the boss'
lady bridget reared her small form and bent her head with great stateliness
'but i'll just say though' went on ninnis 'that i hear harris of the police is coming along
and what harris doesn't think he knows about the heel of the law being kept on blacksand every other darned unit in the creation scheme'muttered ninnis in parenthesis'ain't entered in the almighty's logbook'
ninnis expectorated over the veranda railingsa habit of his that jarred on lady bridget
'well what about harris'
'he's had his eye on wombo and would be glad of an opportunity to best himon account of a little affair about a colt wombo rode for him at the last tunumburra racesand lost the stakesout of spite harris declares'
'oh i know about thatand i told mr harris what i thought about his treatment of the blacks
but he can't punish wombo if i choose to have him here
i don't think mr mckeith would bring harris to moongarrhe knows i can't bear him'
'well i reckon that's up to you to square with the boss' repeated ninnis surlily
'i'm told harris is on the lookout for desperate characters going along the leurathese unionist organisersdropping in at stations on pretence of getting rations and spying out the land and calling on the men to join them
there was a boundary rider from breeza downs todaycaught us up with the tailing mob and fetched back their new chum and zack duppo leaving us awful shorthandedso that if joe casey doesn't fetch in the milkers so early tomorrow you'll know it's because i've had to send him out herding
they're doing their shearing early at breeza downs with shearers windeatt has imported from the south and he wants police protection for them and himself'
lady bridget laughed
'harris and his two constables will have enough to do if they are to protect the district'
'that's just what windeatt has been clamouring about
now the government have sent up a military patrol i believe
but they say it isn't strong enough and all the ablebodied men on the leura are enrolling as specials
no doubt that's what been keeping the boss
you may be sure if there's fighting to be doneblack or whitehe'll be in it'
lady bridget angered ninnis by her apparent indifference and he bade her a cross goodnight
had it been anybody else she would have encouraged him to stay and talk
as it was she resumed her lonely pacing and did not go to her room till the whole station was abed
when at last she went to sleep she dreamed again vividly of willoughby maule
chapter    mckeith returned without warning the following afternoon
he was not alone but had spurred on in advance of the other two men he had brought with him
lady bridget reading in her hammock at the upper end of the veranda heard the sound of a horse approaching and saw her husband appear above the hill from the gully crossing
she got to her feet expecting that he would ride up to the veranda calling 'biddybiddy' as he usually did after an absence
but instead he pulled up suddenly turned his horse in the direction of the bachelors' quarters and passed from her line of vision
she supposed naturally that someone at the quarters had attracted his attention then remembering that ninnis and the white men were out with the cattle wondered as the minutes went by who and what detained him
tommy hensor running up from the garden with his evening dole of vegetables enlightened her
'boss come back ladyship
i can see him
he is up talking to mother'
lady bridget was too proud a woman to feel petty jealousy nor would it have occurred to her to be jealous of mrs hensor
her sentiment of dislike towards that person was of quite another order
but she was just in the mood to resent neglect on the part of mckeith
she went to the veranda railing whence she had a view of the bachelors' quarters and was able to see for herself that tommy's report had been correct
she called to the child  'go at once tommy and tell the master that i am waiting'
tommy flew off immediately on his small sturdy legs and lady bridget watched the scene at the bachelors' quarters
mckeith had dismounted and with one foot on the edge of the veranda was facing mrs hensor who looked fresh and comely in a clean blouse and brightcoloured skirt
the two seemed to have a good deal to say to each other though lady bridget heard only the voices not the words
her irish temper rose at the thought that mrs hensor might be giving him her version of the wombo episode
she felt glad that the blackboy and his gin were comfortably sleeping off the effect of their wounds and of the plentiful meals supplied them in the hidehouse and thus were not in evidence
when mckeith spoke it was in a dictatorial angry tonethat of the incensed master
clearly however mrs hensor was not the object of his wrath
lady bridget saw little tommy run excitedly up to deliver her message and almost cried out to him to keep away from the horses' heels to which he went perilously near
as things happened the beast lashed out at him and tommy had a very narrow escape of being badly kicked
lady bridget heard mrs hensor shriek and saw her husband drag the child to the veranda and examine him anxiously mrs hensor bending with him
then mckeith lifted up tommy and kissed and patted him almost as if he had been the boy's father
it always gave bridget a queer little spasm of regret to see colin's obvious affection for the little fellow
he was fond of children specially so of this one
lady bridget knew though he had never said so to her that he was disappointed at there being no apparent prospect of her having a child
and shewith her avidity for any new sort of sensation although she scoffed at the joy of maternityfelt secretly inclined sometimes to gird at fate for having so far denied her this experience
she herself liked tommy in her contradictory whimsical fashion but now the fuss over the boywho clearly was not in the least hurtmade her very cross and she became positively furious at seeing mckeith delay yet further to unstrap his valise and get out a toy he must have bought for tommy in tunumburra
then his grievance aparently coming back on him he put the child abruptly aside and leaving valise and horse at the bachelors' quarters walked with determined steps and frowning visage down the track to the veranda
there his wife was standing very pale very erect her eyes glittering ominously
mckeith was through the gate and up the flight of steps in three or four strides
he seemed to sense the antagonism in her and demanded at once without waiting to give her any greeting
'biddy what's this i'm hearing about wombo and that gin'
'i think you might have asked me before going to mrs hensor for information' she answered with equal curtness
he stared at her for a moment or two as if surprised his face reddened and his eyes too glittered
'i don't know what you mean
i had to speak to mrs hensor about beds being wanted up there and of course i asked her how things had been going on'
'and did she tell you that she had been inhuman and insolent'
'inhuman
insolent'
'she spoke to me impudently
she defied my orders'
'i am given to understand that she was carrying out mine' said mckeith slowly
'and if that's so mrs hensor was in the right'
'you put that woman before mebefore your wife'
'there's not another woman in the universe i'd put before my wife
but that's no reason for my giving in to her when she does what i know to be folly'
'i see
you call an act of common humanity follydoing what one could to relieve the agony of a fellow creature
i am glad that i differ from youand from your servant
mrs hensor refused to help that poor gin who had a spear through her arm and was shrieking with pain'
'oh you don't know blackgins as well as i do
they'll pretend they're dying in agony just to wheedle a drop of rum or a fig of tobacco out of a white man and they'll take it quite as a matter of course when one of their men bashes their head in with a nullanulla'
'i suppose you'll allow that a spear wound may hurt a little' said bridget
'i believe that you yourself suffered from the effect of one at least you once told me so'
and memoryso active these late days brought suddenly back the vision of him as he had approached her that evening at government house
what a great viking he had lookedin modern dress of course but bearing mark of battle in a slight drag of the left leg only noticeable she knew now when he was shy and proud and under to him difficult social conditions
but what a man she had felt him to be then among the other men
it seemed an outrage on her idealised image of him to hear him speaking in that dry caustic manner
'ah that's different
the gulf natives have a nasty way of barbing and poisoning their spears
an ordinary spearthrust is nothing to either black or white
wombo could have pulled the thing out and in a few hours the gin would have been all right again'
'you think sowell in a few hours she was in a high fever
i took her temperature this morning when i rebandaged the wound'
mckeith laughed shortly
'it wouldn't be surprising if you had given her grog and tobacco and as much meat as she wanted
that what you did eh'
'yes it was
they were both starving'
'well i wouldn't bank on your stock of medical knowledge biddynot if i was down with fever or otherwise incapacitated
but that's not the pointwhich is that those blacks have been kept here against my express orders'
'they've been kept here by my orders' flamed lady bridget
mckeith's jaw squared and there showed in his eyes that ugly devil which many a black and white man had seen but never his wife before
'look here miladythere can be only one boss on this station
and now you'll excuse me if i act according to my own discretion'
without another word he walked up the veranda and down the few steps connecting it with the old humpey
she heard him go into his office and presently the door of it slammed behind him
she knew that he was going to the culprits in the hidehouse and wondered what punishment he would mete unto them
had he gone to the office for his gun
at this moment anything seemed possible to lady bridget's heated temper and excited imagination
she stood waiting absorbed in her fears so abstracted from her ordinary outside surroundings that she was unaware of the approach of two horsemen from the gully crossing
they did not stop at the garden gate but made for the usual station entrance at the back
one of them lingering behind the other gazed earnestly at lady bridget's tense little figure and bent head poised in a listening attitude and conveying to him the impression that something momentous had happened or was about to happen
and just then appalling shrieks from the rear of the home justified the impression
lady bridget ran through the sittingroom to the veranda behind which again connected on either side the new house with the old humpey and kitchen and storewingthe hidehouse standing slightly apart at the end of the store building
the shrieks in male and female keys came from the hidehouse and mingled with mckeith's strident tones fulminating in blacks' lingo
the noise brought mrs hensor and tommy down from the bachelors' quarters and the chinese cook the malay boy and maggie the housemaid from the service department
the three verandas and garden plot made a kind of amphitheatre and now into the arena came the actors in the little tragedy
from the hidehouse mckeith dragged the prisoners and through the gateway in the palings which made the fourth side of the enclosure
with one hand he clutched wombo with the other oola who in her lacetrimmed petticoat and flowered kimono was truly a tragicomic spectacle
mckeith carried his coiled stockwhip in the hand which held wombo
it was plain judging from the state of wombo's new shirt that he had given the black boy a thrashing oola was unscathed
of course colin could not lift his hand to a woman though he was a brute and the woman only a blackgin
lady bridget felt faintly glad at this
she watched the scene half fascinated half disgusted all her attention concentrated on these three figures
she had but a dim consciousness of two men riding round the storewing and dismounting
one of the two remained in the background screened by the trails of native cucumber overhanging the veranda end
the othera wiry powerful figure in uniform with a rubicund face black bristling moustache and beard and prominent black eyes reminding one of the eyes of a bullwalked forward and spoke with an air of official assurance
'can i be of any use to you mr mckeith in dealing with that nigger
a bad character as i've reason to know'
'no thank you harris
i can do my own dirty jobs' said mckeith shortly
he had released the pair and now stood grimly surveying them
oola was crying and squealing wombo stood uprighta scowl of hate on his face
his whole nature seemed changed
a flogging will rouse the semicivilised black's evil passions like nothing else
there was something of savage dignity in the defiant way in which he faced his former master
'what for you been takeit stockwhip longa me
ba'al me bad black boy longa you boss
what for me no have 'em gin belonging to me
massa catch 'im bujeri white mary like it gin belonging to him
what for no all same black fellow'
mckeith cut short the argumentsound logic it seemed to lady biddyby an imperious silencing gesture and a sudden unfurling of his stockwhip which made a hissing sound as it writhed along the ground like a snake
the black boy sprang aside
mckeith pointed to the gidia scrub and issued a terse command in the native language
'yan' go
'ba'al you woolla' don't talk any more
'yan'
wombo turned appealingly to lady bridget
'lathychap'
'yan' stormed mckeith again and as lady bridget made a movement of sympathetic response towards the black fellow he added sternly 'you'll oblige me by not interfering in this business
the blacks know that what i say i mean and i'll have no more words with them'
bridget stood quite still her attitude and expression all indignant protest but she said nothing
her face was turned full towards the man hidden by the creepers who was watching her with intense interest but she was unconscious of his gaze
wombo retreated slowly
oola cowed whimpering behind him
then she made an appeal to lady bridget stretching out her unbandaged arm imploringly
'white maryyou pidney understand
that fellow medsin manhusband belonging to me

ba'al wombo got 'im spearba'al got 'im nullanulla

she pleaded 'bujeri you pialla intercede with boss'
lady bridget came down the steps from the veranda and went up to mckeith
'colin what the gin says is true
her tribe will kill them and they have no weapons and no means of protection
will you as a favour to me let them stay for a few days
at least till her arm is healed and the danger past'
mckeith hesitated perceptibly then the consciousness of weakening resolve made him harden himself the more made his speech rougher than it might have been
'no i can't biddy
i never break my word
they've got to go'
he turned fiercely on wombo who stood sullen and defiant again and from him to oola who crouched in the dust sobbing pitifully and rubbing her damaged arm
'plenty me sick bossclose up tumbledown' die she wailed
'stop that
yando you hear
yanyanburriburri' go quickly
the whip lashed out again
it stung wombo's bare leg and flicked oola's petticoat
the two ran screaming lustily towards the rocks and scrubby country at the head of the gully
lady bridget uttered a shuddering exclamation and made an impetuous movement with arms partly outstretched as if to follow the pair
then her arms dropped and she stood stock still
there was a dead silence
in all the relations of husband and wife never had there been a moment more crucial as affecting their ultimate future
they looked at each other unflinchingly neither speaking
mckeith's lips were resolute locked his pugnacious jaw set like iron
here was the stubborn determination of a fighting man never to admit himself in the wrong
and his eyes seemed to have a steel curtain over themwhich however had bridget's spiritual intuition been awake to perceive it softened for an instant letting through a gleam of passionate appeal
but bridget's soul was steelcased also
he saw only contempt repulsion in her gaze
the larger issues narrowed to a conflict of two egoisms
it seemed to both as though in the space of that last quarter of an hour they had become mortal foes
the police inspector broke in upon the tense silence
here was another egoism to be reckoned withmalevolently officious
'they'll be hiding in the gully mr mckeith
no fear of them taking to the outside bush with the tribe hanging round
i'll just round 'em up and drive 'em into the scrub and strike the fear of the law into them
i'll do it now before i turn out my horse into the paddock'
'no' flamed lady bridget
'you'll leave those unfortunate creatures aloneorif you molest themwhether it's by my husband's permission or notwellyou'll find i'm a bad hater mr harris'
the police inspector flushed a deep red
'maybe i'm not such a bad hater either my ladybut with my respects'  'that will do harris' interposed mckeith
'i told you that i'd do my own dirty jobs
there's no occasion for you to go against her ladyship's wishes'
harris touched his helmet to lady bridget and leering with veiled enmity replied  'i'm never one to put myself up against the ladies except where my duty comes firstand that's not the caseyet
but as i was saying with my respects my lady mr mckeith knows very well how to treat the blacks
he knows that you've got to keep your word to them whether that means a plug of tobacco or a plug of cold iron'
lady bridget drew back and looked at harris for a second or two with an expression of the most withering haughtiness
then without a word she turned her back on him
the inspector infuriated muttered in his throat
mckeith interposed sharply  'bridget harris is going to stay the night'
'ah
at the bachelors' quarters' lady bridget smiled with distant calm
'of course mrs hensor knows
i'm sorry i can't ask mr harris to dinner at the house this evening'
now by the social canons of the bush the police inspector being technically speaking of higher grade than the casual traveller should have been accepted as a 'parlour visitor'
he would thus have occupied one of the bachelor spare rooms in the old humpey and would have joined the boss and his wife at dinner
harris had never before stayed the night at moongarr and he had confidently expected to be received with honour
thus he regarded lady bridget's speech as an insult
'oh i'm not one to force my company where it is not wanted' he blustered
'i'm quite content with a shakedown at the quarters though if i'd known i might have gone by the short cut with the specialsit's rather late however to push on to breeza downs wherethough perhaps i say it as shouldn'ti'm sure of a welcome from mr and mrs windeatt being so to speakfor law and orderthe representative of his majesty in the leura district'
lady bridget smiled with detached amusement as she turned again and patted the head of an elderly kangaroo dog which came up to her with its tongue out and a look of wistful enquiry in its bleared eyes scenting plainly that something was amiss
'good dog veno' she murmured
harris bridled
'i'll bid you good evening then my lady' he said stiffly
'no doubt mr mckeith you'll spare me half an hour in the office by and by
just to concert our measures for the proper protection of the pastoralists and the safeguarding of the woolsheds this shearing season'
'yes yes or course' mckeith answered mechanically
the spunk had gone out of him as harris would have phrased it and the inspector looking at lady bridget guessed the reason
'and what now about the gentleman from leichardt's town mr mckeith
will i be taking him up with me to the bachelor's quarters
or may be' harris added unpleasantly 'her ladyship won't object to having him in the house'
mckeith muttered angrily 'damn
i'd forgotten'
it was not like him to lose himself during working hours in even a momentary fit of abstractionexcept indeed when he was riding without immediate objective through the bush
his eyes were still upon his wife's slight figure as she moved slowly towards the veranda with the air of one who has no more concern with the business in hand
her graceful aloofness which he knew to be merely a social trick stung him inexpressibly the faint bow she had given harris when he bade her good evening had seemed to include himself
it galled him that he did not seem fitted by nature or breeding to cope with this kind of situation
the half consciousness of inferiority put him still more at disadvantage with himself
'biddy wait please' he said dictatorially
she paused at the steps her hand on the railings her eyes under their lowered lids ignoring him
he went closer and spoke rapidly in a harsh undertone
'i didn't tell youthough i rode ahead on purposei met a man at tunumburra who said he knew you
he's out from englandbeen staying at government house and brought a letter from sir luke tallant
i hope that at any rate you'll be civil to him'
she flashed a quick glance at him and her eyelids dropped again
'but naturally
i'm not in the habit of being uncivil tomy friends'
and just thenmrs hensor who loved cheap fiction said afterwards it was all like a scene out of a bookthere appeared in the space between the two wings a man who had strolled unobserved from one side out of the background of creepers and who advanced with quickened step to where the husband and wife stood
chapter    a striking individual
tallthough not as tall or as massively built as colin mckeith firm boned and muscular but with a sort of feline grace of movement
there was the unmistakable stamp of civilisation and at the same time an exotic suggestion of the east of wild spaces adventure romance
not in the least a bushman but wearing with ease and picturesqueness a backwoods getup
clothes extremely well cut riding breeches and boots soft shirt and falling collar with a silk tie of dull flame colour knotted at the sinewy throat loose coat panama hat
so much for the figure
the face ugly but distinguished sallowbrown in colouring
nose long fine with a slight twist below the bridge cheeks and chin cleanshaven an enormous dark moustache concealing the mouth
hair black slightly grizzled and when he lifted his hat forming a thick lightly frosted crest above his forehead
eyes blackpeculiar eyes sombre restless but with a gaze steady and piercing when concentrated on a particular object as just now it was concentrated on lady bridget
the gaze seemed compelling
lady bridget suddenly lifting eyes that were instantly wide open became aware of the man's presence
the effect of it upon her was so marked that mckeith watching her face felt a shock of surprise
the change in her was noticed by the police inspector with malevolent curiosity
so also by mrs hensor a little further away
the newcomer saluted her with a low bow his hat in one hand the other extended
'you haven't forgotten me i hope lady bridget though i should think that i am the very last person in the world you would have expected to see in these parts'
lady bridget had turned very white
she stared at him as if he had been a ghost and at first seemed unable to speak
but her confusion lasted only a few seconds
almost before he had finished his sentence she had pulled herself together
her hand was in his and she spoke in her old fluty voice and little grand manner with the old slow faintly whimsical smile on her lips and in her eyes
it came over mckeith that he had not of late been familiar with this aspect of her and that she was exhibiting to this man the same strange charm of her girlhood which had been to him in the full fervour of his devotion so wonderful and worshipful but of whichhe knew it nowthe bush had to a great extent robbed her
she laughed as she withdrew her hand from that of the newcomer
and standing on the steps her head almost on a level with his met his eyes with challenging directness
'really mr maule you shouldn't startle a nervous creature in that uncanny wayappearing like the unmentionable personage or the angel if you prefer it only with this difference that we weren't speaking of you
i hadn't the most distant notion that you were on this side of the equator
if my husband had mentioned your name i should not have been so taken by surprise'
'were you really so surprised
i thought i must have sent my shadow on before mebecause i've been thinking so tremendously of you these last few days and of the prospect of seeing you again
i daresay you know' he added turning politely to mckeith'that i had the pleasure of meeting your wife when she was lady bridget o'hara one winter at rome with her cousins lord and lady gaverick
and later we saw something of each other in london'
'no my husband doesn't know' bridget gave a reckless laugh and her eyes challenged those of mckeith before he could answer
'you see colin and i when we married came from opposite poles geographically morally and mentally
he did not understand or care about my old environment any more than i understoodor cared about his
so we agreed to bury our respective pasts in oblivion
don't you think it was a good plan'
'quite admirable
i admire your mutual courage in adopting it'
'you think so
it has its drawbacks though' said mckeith dryly
'i must apologise for having left you to announce yourself
the fact is those blacks put other things out of my head
they had to be taught they couldn't disobey orders without being punished for it'
'poor wretches
yes
i know the popular idea of asserting british supremacy over coloured races by the force of the whip
i have not always seen it answer but then my experience has been with natives rather higher in the scale of evolution than the australian aboriginal'
'you believe in the power of kindnessas i do' exclaimed lady bridget
'my husband and i take different views on that subject
but we need not discuss them now
come and have some tea and tell me about the tallants'
maule followed her to the door of the living room where she turned to give some orders to maggie the maidservant and to the chinese cook
mckeith went off with harris to see after the horses and have a talk with ninnis at the stockyards
thus maule was left alone for a few minutes to study and form his own opinion as to lady bridget's setting
she was a woman who whatever her surroundings must always impress them with her personality
this bush parlour was original in its simplicity
walls lined with unvarnished wood which was mellowing already to a soft golden brown
boards bare but for a few rugs and skins
a fine piece of tappa from the solomons of barbaric design in black and orange made the centre of an arrangement of south sea island and aboriginal weapons
divans heaped with cushions flanked the great fireplace
two writingtables occupied spaces between french windowsone the desk of a businesslike rolltop escritoire the other the flap of a chippendale bureau with a chippendale armchair before it
there were a few other pieces unmistakable english
in fact eliza countess of gaverick in addition to a handsome present of plate had sent her niece the furnishings of her old room at castle gaverick
a few pictures and etchings hung on the other wallsamong them several wild seascapesreminding one a little of richard doyle's exquisite water coloursin which green billows and foamy wavecrests took the shape of seafairies
also some weird tree studiesmostly gum and gidia where gnarled limbs and bulbous protuberances turned into the faces of gnomes and the forms of strange monsters
maule had no doubt that these were lady bridget's own
there was an upright grand pianothe alleged cause of steadbolt's conversion to unionism and all about the place a litter of newspapers books and work
the room was filled with flowerssheaves of wattle and of the pale sandalwood blossoms as well as many subtropical blooms with which he was not familiar
blending with yet dominating the mixture of perfumes a peculiar scent resembling incense appealed to him and this he did not a first trace to a log of sandalwood smouldering on the open hearth more for effect than warmth for the early spring evenings had scarcely a touch of chill
the french windows stood open to the veranda a room in itself with its many squatters' chairs hammocks and tables
beyond stretched the green expanse of plain utterly lonely the waters of the lagoon taking a reddish tinge where they reflected the lowering sun
it seemed an inconceivable environment to have been chosen by the lady bridget he had known in london one of whose chief attractions to him had been that she represented a certain section of the aristocracy of great britain decadent perhaps but 'in the swim'
she cam now along the veranda from the old humpey with the light rather hurried tread he remembered talking rapidly when she joined him
'i've been seeing about your room
i suppose you know enough now of the nevernever to understand that we are quite primitive in our habits
you won't find a spring mattressor water laid onor any other convenience of civilisation'
'may i remind you that i've roughed it pretty well in the andes'
'yes but you have had so many luxuries since then that you will have forgotten what roughing it feels likejust as i've forgotten now that i was ever anything but a barbariani see you shave still'
'yeswhy'
'only that i discovered just now the white ants had eaten all the woodwork of the spareroom lookingglass
the thing crumbled in my hand and fell on the floor and was broken
a bad omen for your visit isn't it'
'i hope not
so you are superstitious as ever'
'i haven't ceased to be a celtthough i've become a barbarian
i'll borrow the overseer's looking glass for you'
'pray don't
i've got one of sorts in my razor case
is dinner regarded in the nevernever as a sacred ceremonial'
'the men don't put on dress clothes if that's what you mean
as for the repast for a long time as a rule the menu was salt junk and pumpkin
we've improved on that a little since the chinese cook and the chinese gardener came back from the goldfieldsthere was another rush at fig tree mount that fizzled out
tonight you will have kangarootail soup and kid en casserole
if you make believe very hard you might possible imagine it young venison
here kuppi'
the malay boy brought in the teatray and she signed to him to put it on the table between the fire and the window
'tea' she asked 'or would you rather have whiskey and water
i can't offer you soda water because till the drays come we have nothing to run the seltzogene with do you know that the unionists cut our dray horses' throats
we're lucky to have whiskey in the store
they broke open the cases of spirits and stole a lot of things vicissitudes of savage life you see'
she rattled on scarcely pausing
she was seated on a divan the tea before herhe in a squatter's chair with long arms in which he sat silent leaning forward his hands on the chairarms his eyes fixed upon her
she avoided looking at him
her small sunbrowned hands fidgeted among the cups
if anything remained of her anger and emotion she hid it under a ripple of absurd housewifely chatter not waiting for him to answer
'well is it to be tea or whiskey'
'tea please' and then at last she stopped and looked at him and could not turn her eyes away or did not want to do so
his black orbs stared with a disquieting fixitya sort of inhuman powerfrom out of his foreignlooking face
that stare was his chief weapon in the subjugation of womenthey called it magnetic and no doubt it was so
it increased the fascination of his ugly good looks
the gaze of each one seemed to fuse in that of the other
hers at first coldly curious tentative caught light warmth intensity from the sombre fire of his
suddenly he said  'in god's name biddy how did you come to marry that rough brute'
'is he a rough brute
it's very rude of you to say so
but do you know just for a half minute today i rather thought so myself
i don't pretend to agree with colin's methods of treating the blacks though i'm told it's the only way to treat themyou know they did commit terrible atrocities up here
still to flog a black man a wild warlike human creature seems to me nearly as bad as shooting him
do you knowthe first thing i ever heard about colin was that he had a great many notches on his gun and that each one meant a wild blackfellow that he had shot dead'
'and now he flogs tame ones' maule observed quietly
her brilliant eyes searched his face for a sign of malevolent sarcasm but not a muscle quivered
her own eyes wavered under his steady look
she busied herself among the tea things
'sugar'
'please'
but she paused the tongs balanced in her delicate fingers
'it is frightfully thrillinglife in the bush'
'what part of it
the shooting or the flogging'
she burst out 'you know i hated that
you know i was furious about the flogging
you know'she pulled herself up
'i know nothingexcept that you must have changed enormously in a very short time to have been thrilled with anything but horrorby that sort of thing'
'yes i have changed
but it isn't time that changes one
time never counts with me
it's only feeling that counts
oh of course i think it all horribleabout the blacks up north
they're not allowed on this stationexcept one or two half civilised stockboysand this one fell in love and carried off his gin and brought her here against my husband's orders'
'yes
and you had befriended themi gathered that
but it doesn't explain you'
she took up a piece of sugar with the tongs holding it suspended as she spoke jerkily
'why should i be explained
as for my finding life in the bush thrilling
i was dead sick of falsities when i left england i wanted to be thrilled by something real'
'and you found thatin your husband'
'yes i did
he is real at least
he is true to himself
so few men have the strength of their goodness or the courage of their badness when it comes to a big test'
'oh
i grant you
yes i know that's what you're thinking
i wasn't true to myself in the big test
but you were to blame for my having been false to the higher ideal'
'i
ohwhat makes you' but she thought better of the impetuous questions that trembled on her lips and went on in a different tone
'what does that matter
i'm not saying anything about high ideals
what is high
 what is low
 you've just got to invoke truth and freedomas far as your conception of them goes and there's a reason for colin's hatred of the blacks'
'ah
is it permitted to ask the reason'
'his family were all massacred by the nativesfather mother sistersall
well one admires a man steadfast in revengegoing straight for what he wantsand getting itdoing itin love or in hate
now i have answered your question'
the gesture of her head seemed a defiance
she dropped the sugar into his tea and he took the cup from her hands and slowly drank it without saying a word
it was she who broke the silence
'you provoke me
you make me say things i don't want to say
you always did'
'ah
then marriage has not changed you so immensely after all'
she bit her lip and rose abruptly
'do you want any more tea
no
then come to the veranda and tell me how it is that luke tallant has allowed you to exchange government house for the nevernever'
he had followed her through the french window
'i see you haven't heard the bad news'
'nowhat
we only get a mail once a week'
'i thought mckeith would have broken the shock
he came on he said to do so
poor lady tallant'
'rosamond
the operation'
'she died under the anaesthetic
sir luke got the news by cable the day before i left leichardt's town
he wired at once for leave and has started for england by this time'
'oh
poor rosamond
poor poor rosamond'
'is she to be so greatly pitied
she has been saved much suffering'
then as bridget went on murmuring 'oh poor rosamond she did love life' he added gently
'life can be very cruel
i myself have had cause for gratitude to death the great simplifier
if my wife had lived she must have been a hopeless invalid doomed to continual pain'
lady bridget gave him a swift look of reproach
'oh do you expect me to congratulate you'
she exclaimed bitterly
'yes' she went on 'perhaps to her death was mercifulbut not to rosamond
and luke did care for his wife
he will be brokenhearted'
she stood gazing out upon the plain on which the mist was gathering
from across the gully sounded the cattle being driven home
when she turned to him her eyes were full of tears
'i think i'll go now'
she said simply
'colin will show you your room
he's therecoming up from the lagoon'
she went through a french window lower down the veranda into her bedroom and maule descended the steps into the garden and presently joined his host
chapter    a little later mckeith having tubbed and changed his riding clothes came to his wife's room
he looked very large and clean and fair and the worst of his temper had worn off in a colloquy with ninnis and the imparting and receiving of local news
but his eyes were still gloomy and his mouth sullenly determined
and he had remembered with remorse that he should have softened to bridget the sudden news of her friend's death
the sight of her nowa small tragic figure with a white face and burning eyes in a black dress into which she had changed deepened his compunction
'i am very sorry biddy'
he tried to put his arm round her shoulder but she drew back
'what are you sorry for colinthat rosamond tallant is dead and that you forgot to tell me and let me hear it fromwilloughby maule'
she paused perceptibly before pronouncing the christian name 'or that you behaved like an inhuman monster to those wretched blacks and refused me the only thing i have asked you for a good time past'
her tone roused his rancour anew
'i think we'll drop the subject of the blacks there is no earthly use in talking about them i make it a rule never to threaten without performing and i'd punish them again just the sameor more severelyunder similar circumstances'
'very well
you will do as you please and i shall do as i please too'
'what do you mean'
'just what i say
i agree with you that there's no use in discussing things about which we hold such different opinions
quite simply i can't forgive you for this afternoon's work'
'biddy you exaggerate things'
'perhaps
but i don't think so in this case
let me go out colin
dinner must be ready by now'
'no
i've got something to ask you first
i want to know why you looked so upsetas if you were going to faintwhen that man came up to you today'
'naturally i was startled
i had no idea he was in australia'
'but why should that have affected you
one might have imagined he had been your lover
was he ever your lover biddy
i must know'
'and if he had been do you think i should tell you' she answered coldly
mckeith's face turned a dark red
his eyes literally blazed
'that's enough'
he said 'i shall not ask you another question about him
i am answered already'
he stood aside to let her pass out into the veranda and she walked along to the sittingroom
dinner went off however more agreeably than might have been expected
lady bridget's manner was simple and to the guest charming
the black dress the touch of pensiveness was in keeping with the shadow of tragedy
but she spoke in a natural way and with tender regret of lady tallantquestioning maule as to when he had last seen her and learning from him how it had been at rosamond's instigation that he had cabled proposing himself as a companion in sir luke's loneliness
it had been only a week after his arrival in leichardt's town that the blow had fallen
'you know tallant and i always hit it off very well together'he observed explanatorily addressing mckeith
'it was at their house that i used to meet lady bridget during the few months that i had the honour of her acquaintance in england'
mckeith looked at his guest in a resentful but half puzzled way
a spasm of doubt shook him
suppose he had been making a fool of himselfinsulting his wife by unreasoning suspicions
a vague contempt in her courteous aloofness had stung him to the quick
and the other man's easy self assurance the light interchange of conversation between them about things and people of which mckeith knew nothingall gave the australian a sense of bafflementthe feeling that these two were ruled by another social code belonged to a different world in which he had no part
he had been sitting at the head of his table perfunctorily doing his duty as host wounded in his selfesteemalmost the tenderest part on him morose and miserable
now he snatched at the idea that he had been mistaken as if it were a lifebuoy thrown him in deep waters
he began to talk to assert himself to prove himself cock of his own walk
and maule suavely encouraged him to lay down the law on things australian while lady bridget withdrew into herself baffling and enraging mckeith still more hopelessly
he did not seem now to know his wife
a catastrophe had happened
what
how
why

nothing was the same or could be the same again
it was a relief when dinner was over
the men pulled out their pipes in the veranda
lady bridget just within the sitting room window smoked a cigarette her small form extended in a squatter's chair listening to but taking scarcely any part in the conversation
the two outside discussed local topicsmckeith's failure to trace the perpetrators of the outrage on his horses
maule's impressions of tunumburrawhere he had met mckeith in the township hotel and the two had apparently in the usual bush fashion got on intimate termsthe rumours of an armed camp of unionists and the expected conflict between them and the sheep owners and free shearers at breeza downs whither the government specials were bound
lady bridget gleaned that maule had placed himself under mckeith's directions
'what are your immediate movements to be'
he asked his host
'remember i am ready to fall in with any plans you may have for making me useful'
mckeith did not answer at once
he took his pipe from his mouth and knocked the ashes out of it against the arm of his chair while he seemed to be considering the question
then as if he had formed a definite determination he leaned forward and addressed his wife in a forcedly matteroffact tone
'i don't suppose you know much about what has been going on biddy
the same boat that brought up the specials brought a hundred or more free labourers and they're on their way up to the different sheepstations along the rivera lot of them for breeza downs where windeatt has begun shearing
windeatt is in a blue funk because a report that a little army of unionists all mounted and armed are camped that way and threatening to burn down his woolshed and sack his store
the burned old duppo's woolshed last week'
'he's a skinflint and i'm sure he deserved it' put in lady bridget indifferently
mckeith check a dry sarcasm
he became aware of maule's eyes turning from one to the other
'well' he got up and leaned his great frame against the lintel between maule and lady bridget
'the pastoralist executive at tunumburra have asked us cattleowners whoare more likely to be let alone than the sheepmen to help in garrisoning the sheepstations and i've promised to ride over to breeza downs tomorrow and do my share in protecting the place
harris and i are going together'
lady bridge seemed more interested in blowing smokerings than in her husband's news
'i may have to be away several days' continued mckeith
'then there's the new bore we're sinkingthe water is badly wantedcattle are dyingi can't run any risk of the boreplant being wrecked
the men who are working there must be sent off because we're short of rationsthanks to those murderous brutes keeping back the draysand the muster has to be stopped for the same reason
i won't answer for when i can be back'
 as she made no answer he asked sharply 'do you understand biddy'
'yes of course
i have no doubt colin that you'll find it all highly stimulating
and perhaps you will be able to shoot somebody with a clear conscience which will be more stimulating still
really mr maule you are lucky to have come in for a civil wari heard that in south america that was your particular interest
do you carry civil wars about with you
only there's nothing very romantic in fighting for mere freedom of contractit seems so obvious that people should be free to make or decline a contract
i wonder which side you would take'
her levity called forth an impatient ejaculation from mckeith
'i'm afraid in my wars it's generally been what your husband would consider the wrong side' said maule with a laugh
'i've usually fought with the rebels'
'then you'd better not go to breeza downs
you'd better stop and fight for me' exclaimed bridget
'that's just what i was about to propose your friend should do' said mckeith in hard deliberate tones
he looked straight at his wifeshoulders and jaws squared eyes like flashing steel under the grim brows
the expression of his face gave bridget a little sense of shock
she raised herself abruptly and her eyes flashed pride and defiance too
'how very considerate of you colinif mr maule likes to be disposed of in that way
he is to be allowed freedom of contract i presume though the shearers are not'
'you needn't be afraid that i shall strike lady bridget' laughed maule
'it will suit my general principles to keep out of the scrimmage
i don't know anything about the rights and wrongs of your labour question but i confess that speaking broadly my sympathies are usually rather with labour than with capital'
'capital'
echoed mckeith derisively
'it's blithering irony to talk of us leura squatters as representing capital
we're all playing a sort of battledore and shuttlecock gametossed about between drought and plentyboom and slump
a kick in the beam and one end is up and the other end down
there's windeatt who will be ruined if his woolshed is destroyed and his shearing spoiled
no rain and the banks would foreclose on most of us
take myself
two years ago the skies were all smiling on my fortunes
this last year it's as if the hosts of heaven had a down on me'
'the stars in their courses fought against sisera' murmured lady bridget
'i'm sisera am i'
he gave her a fierce look and crossed to the verandarailing where he began cutting tobacco into the palm of his hand
'well there is something in that
but the stars have never licked me yet
sisera was a coward or they wouldn't have downed him'
'ah but there was jael to be reckoned with' put in maule softly
'jael'
mckeith plugged his pipe energetically
'the more fool sisera for not giving jael a wide berth
he should have gone his way and kept her out of his affairs'
a hard little laugh rang from the depths of the squatter's chair
maule got up and strolled into the sittingroom where he seemed engrossed in the pictures on the wall
just then cudgee the black boy hailed mckeith from the foot of the steps
'that fellow pollis man want'ing massa
he sit down longa old humpey'
'all right'
mckeith looked into the parlour
'my wife will entertain you maule
i daresay you've got plenty to talk about
i'll see you later'
presently they heard him outside speaking to the police inspector
'come into the office harris and have a smoke and a glass of grog'
chapter    lady bridget and willoughby maule were alone again
she got up from the long chair and as she did so her cigarette case dropped from her lap
he picked it up and it lay on his open palm the diamonds and rubies of her maiden initials glistening on the gold lid
they looked at each other across it
'i gave you this' he said 'and you have kept itused it'
he seemed to gloat over the bauble
her fingers touched his hand as she took the case from him and he gave a little shiver of pleasure
'let me have it i want another cigarette'
she selected two and gave him one of them
they moved to the divan near the fireplace where some red embers remained of the log of sandalwood
its perfume lingered faintly in the atmosphere
'that's good' he said
'it's like you the only thing in the godforsaken desert that is like you'
'oh you don't know menow'
'don't i
well your husband has given me the chance of knowing youbetterand i warn you that i shall not scruple to avail myself of the opportunity'
she shook her head dubiously
'give me a light'
he stooped and lit his own cigarette then bending held its tip to her
they both inhaled a few whiffs in silence
presently he said  'i find it difficult to understand mckeith'
'don't try
you wouldn't succeed
i observe' she added 'that you must have become rather friendly at tunumburra'
'oh yes
i can generally get on with openair men
besides i wanted him to like me
i wanted him to ask me here'
'welland what do you thing of it now that you are here'
'great heavens
what do you imagine that i should think of it
the whole thing seems to me the most ghastly blunderthe most horrible anomaly
youin these surroundings
married to a man so entirely beneath you and with whom you don't get on at all'
'you have no right to say that'
'the thing is obvious though you tried to carry it off before dinner
your manner to each other the lack of courtesy and consideration in him his leaving you'  'stop' she interrupted
'there's one thing you must understand
i don't mind what you say about yourselfi want to hear thatbut i can't allow you to criticise my husband'
'i beg your pardon
it isn't easy in the conditions to preserve the social conventions
i will try to obey you
at any rate you allow me to be frank about myself
it was sweet of you to keep thismore than i could have dared hope for'
he fingered tenderly the cigarette case on her lap
'i suppose i ought to have sent it back to you
but i didn't want to
you see it was not like an engagement ring'
'no worse luck'
'why worse luck'
'the ring would have been the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual bond
if you had been really engaged to meformally officially engaged you couldn't have thrown me over so easily'
'ithrow you over
is it quite fair to put it that way'
'no i admit that
let us be honest with each otherthis once'
'this oncevery wellbut not at this moment
i daresay there will be time for a talk by and by'
'i wait your pleasure'
'there are some things i should like to understand' she went on 'about youabout me it doesn't matter which
and after all i only want to know about you out of a sort of perverse curiosity'
'that's so like you
you always managed to infuse a bitter drop into your sweetness
and you could be so adorably sweet
if only i could ever have felt sure of you'
'where would have been the use
we never could spend an hour together without hurting or annoying each other
it's a very good thing for us both that neither cared enough to make any real sacrifice for the other'
'there you wrong me' he exclaimed
'i did carei cared intensely
the touch of your handthe very sweep of your dress thrilled every nerve in me
i never in all my life loved a woman as i loved you
that last day when you walked out of my rooms'  'where i never ought to have gone
fancy the properly broughtup english girl you used to hold up to me doing such a shocking thing as to visit you alone in your chambers
 oh
is that colin back again'
for maule had started visibly at the sound of quick steps mounting to the veranda and mckeith's towering figure appeared in the doorway looking at them
lady bridget turned her head her cigarette in her hand and glanced up at his face
what she saw in it might have made a less reckless or less innocent woman feel uneasy
she was sure that he must have heard that last speech of hers about visiting maule in his chambers
well she didn't care
besides colin hadn't the smallest right to resent any action of hers before her marriage she did not turn a hair
maule admired her composure
'bon sang ne peut mentir' he thought to himself and wished they had been talking in french
'you look as grim as the statue of the commander' said lady bridget
'what is the matter'
'lady bridget and i have been exchanging unconventional reminiscences' put it maule with forced lightness
mckeith took no notice of either remark but strode across the room to the rolltop escritoire where he usually wrote his letters when in his wife's company
he extracted a bundle of papers from one of the pigeon holes
'this is what i came for
sorry to have interrupted your reminiscences' and he went out again passing along the back veranda
maule had got up and was standing at the fireplace
lady bridget rose too
'i'm going to bed
we keep early hours in the bush'
'what
already'
he exclaimed in dismay
'i was up at six this morning
well i hope you won't be too uncomfortable with the white ants in the old humpeythey are perfectly harmless
your room is next to the office as i daresay you've discovered
and you'll find colin there i suppose with your friend the policeinspector'
'don't call that man harris my friend
we've had one or two scraps at each other already
he was pleased to take it for granted that i'm what he calls a new chum and didn't like my shewing him that i knew rather better than he does what police administration should be in outoftheway districts'
lady bridget nodded
'then we're both under ban of the law
i detest harris
goodnight'
and she flitted through the french window without giving him her hand
the station seemed in a state of unquietude till late into the night
the lowing of the tailingmob in the yard was more prolonged than usual
and the horses were whinnying and answering each other down by the lagoon as though there were strangers about
lady bridget lying awake and watching through her uncurtained windows the descent of the southern cross towards the horizon and the westward travelling of a moon just out of its first quarter could hear the men's voices on the veranda of the old humpeythat of ninnis and the police inspector maule seemed to have retired to his own room
mckeith was evidently busy upon preparations for his absence from the station
he must have been cleaning guns and pistols
there were two or three shotswhich startled and kept her in a state of tension
at last she heard the interchange of goodnights and the withdrawal of ninnis and harris to the bachelor's quarters
finally her husband came to his dressingroomnot along the front veranda as would have been usual but by the back one through the bathroom
even this deviation from habit seemed significant of his moodhe would not pass her window
he moved about for a time as if he were busy packing
then came silence
she imagined him on the edge of the camp bed so seldom used smoking and ruminating
whiffs from his pipe came through the cracks of the door between the two rooms and were an offence to her irritated nerves
she had grown accustomed to his tobacco but as a rule he did not smoke the last thing at night
he had seemed to regard his wife's chamber as a tabernacle enshrining that which he held most sacred and would never enter it until he was cleansed from the grime and dust of the stockyard and cattle camp and had laid aside the associations of his working day
that attitude had appealed to all that was idealistic in both their natures and had kept green the memory of their honeymoon
it angered her that tonight of all nights he should disregard it
in personal details she was intensely fastidious and at some trouble and cost had maintained in her intimate surroundings a daintiness almost unknown outback
her room was large and much of its furnishings symptomatic of the woman of her classthe array of monogrammed tortoiseshell backed brushes and silver and gold topped boxes and bottles the embroidered coverlet of the bed the flowered chintz and soft pink wall paper the laced cambric garments and silkfrilled dressing gown hanging over a chair
when service lacked and there was no one to wash and iron her cambric and fine linen she contrived somehow that the supply should not fail and brought upon herself some illnatured ridiculed in consequence
the wives of the leura squatters thought her 'stuckup' and apart from their kind
if they had known how much she wanted sometimes to throw herself into their livesas she had thrown herself into the lives of her eastend socialistic friends
but the stations were few and far between and the neighbourssuch as they wereleft her alone
letting her mind drift along sidetracks she resented now there having come no suggestion from the breeza downs women that she should accompany her husband and share the benefits of police protection orwhich appealed to her far morethe excitement of what might be going on there
of course though there was nothing for her to be nervous about hereshe wished there might have been
any touch of dramatic adventure would be welcome in the crude monotony of her life
but the adventure promised to be of a more personal kind
suddenly she jumped out of bed and softly slipped the bolt of the door into her husband's dressing room
she did it on a wild impulse
she felt that she could not bear him near her tonight
he should see that she was not his chattel
but perhaps he did not want to come well so much the better
in any case she wanted to show him that she did not want him
she wondered if he would venture she wondered if he did really care
he appeared in no hurry to test her capacity for forgiveness or it might be that the minutes went slowlyladen as they were with momentous thought
she lay in a tumult of agitation her heart beating painfully under the lawn of her nightgown
she had a sense of gasping wonderment
she felt as colin had felt that something tremendous had happenedand with such bewildering suddennessaltering all the conditions between them
yet through the pain and bewilderment her whole being thrilled with an excitement that was almost intoxicatinglike the effect of an insidious drug or the fumes of heady wine
she knew it was the old craving for sensation the fatal o'hara temperament awake and clamouring
try as she wouldand she did try in a futile fashionshe could not shut off the impression of willoughby maulethe sombre ardour in his eyes the note of suppressed passion in his voice
there was no doubt that this unexpected meeting had restarted vibrations and that his influence was a force to be reckoned with still
if colin had acted differentlyif he had not behaved so brutally to those poor blacksif his manner to her had not been so hard and overbearing
and then his leaving her alone like that with willoughby maule
of course he was jealous
he had jumped at conclusions
what right had he to do so
what could he know
he must suspect her of horrible things
his questions had been insultingly dictatorial
now he wanted to shew her that he flung her off
he would not put out a finger to hold her to him
had he not said something like that before their marriage

it was abominable
the whiffs of tobacco smoke came no more
he was moving about again
she heard him in the bathroom
after a minute or two he came to the door and tried to open it
'biddy' he said
then in a deeptoned eager whisper 'mate'
she sat up in bed she had the impulse to go and open the door but some demon held her back
she lay down again on her pillow
the bed had creaked
he must have known that she was awake
he waited a minute or two without speaking  knocked very softly she was silent again she heard him moving about in his dressingroom and after a little while she heard him go out passing along the back veranda
he did not return
it was dawn before bridget dropped into the heavy morning slumber which follows a night of weeping
book iii   from the point of view of colin mckeith and others     chapter    when lady bridget awoke it was then near the hour at which they ordinarily breakfasted
finding when she had dressed that all was silent in the next room she looked in
it was empty the bed had not been slept in but there were signs that mckeith had got into his riding clothes and that he had packed a valise
maule was waiting in the diningroom and maggie the serving maid gave a message from mckeith that he had had his breakfast at the bachelors' quarters with mr harris and that they were both going to start for breeza downs immediately
bridget made no pretence of breakfasting
she told maule to forage for himself and after swallowing a cup of coffee made the excuse of household businessto see if the chinaman had put up his master's lunchif the waterbags were filledwhat were to be the proceedings of the day
she had a hope that mckeith might say something conciliatory to her before he left
the remembrance of that disregarded appealthe word 'mate' to which she had given no response weighed a guilty load upon her heart
but she was sore and angryin no mood to make any advance or stoop to selfjustification
he was outside the store where ninnis was weighing rations for harris and mckeith's and the police inspector's horses ready saddled with valises strapped on were hitched to the paling
harris sulkily touched his helmet to lady bridget but mckeith had his back to her and seemed wholly absorbed in some directions he was giving
'you'll see to it ninnis that six saddlehorses are kept ready to run up in case the pastoralist executive sends along any message that's got to be carried down the riverthere's that lot of colts zack duppo broke in they'll do
and you can get in alexander and roxalana from the bore pasture in case the buggy should be wantedand one or two of the old hacks that are spelling out there
of course her ladyship's horse mustn't be touched and you'll see mr maule has a proper mount if he wants itthe gentleman who'll be here for a bita friend of her ladyship's from englandyou understand
you'll keep on those new men for the tailing mob though i'm not sure they mightn't be unionists in disguise
anyway moongarr bill is a match for them and you'll just mindthe lot of youthat it's my orders to stockwhip blacks off the place and that if any unionist delegates show their faces through the sliprails they're not allowed to stop five minutes inside the paddock fence'
'right you are boss' responded ninnis and there was a change of grouping and mckeith strode out to the yard to look into some other matter all without sending a glance to his wife
presently moongarr bill came up chuckling mysteriously 'say boss i believe there's one of them dashed organising chaps coming down now from the top sliprails'
and as he spoke a man rode to the fence harmless enough looking of the ordinary bush type
he was about to get off his horse in the assured manner of a bushman claiming the usual hospitality but mckeithbig and grimly menacingadvanced and held up his hand
'no wait a bit
don't unsaddle
i'd like first to know your business'
'i'm an organiser' said the man defiantly 'and i'm not ashamed of my job
trades unions are lawful combinations and i've come to have a talk with your men' he ran on with professional volubility
'my object in going round your district is to bring about a peaceful compromise between employers and employeddo you see'
'stop' thundered mckeith
'i'd have you understand that there's an organiser on this station already
i'm the organiser here and i'm not taking stock in trades unions at present'
'but you'll let me have a talk with your menno harm in that'
'no you don't' said mckeith
'well i can spell my horse an hour or two can't i'
'no you can't
you'll ride off my station straight away'
'i've been off tucker since yesterday' said the man who seemed a poorspirited creature
'anyhow boss you'll give me something to eat'
'yes i'll do that'
the laws of bush hospitality may not be violated
food must be given even to an enemyprovided he be white
mckeith called to the chinaman to bring out beef and bread
a lump of salt junk and a hunk of bread were handed to the traveller
'now you be off and eat that outside my paddock' said mckeith
'see those gum trees over thereyou can go and organise the gum trees'
the man scowled and weakly threatened as he half turned his horse's head
'look here boss you'll find yourself the worse for this'
'shall i
in what way can you tell me'
'you'll find that your grass is burned i daresay'
'i'm obliged to you for the hint
i'll take precautions and i'll begin by shepherding you straight off my run' said mckeith
'harris if you're ready now come along here'
the police inspector stepped off the store veranda where he had been standing a majestic and interested onlooker
the organiserafter all a mere man of straw crumpled under his baneful stare
'you can't give me in chargeyou've got no warranti've done nothing to be given in charge for'
'some of your people have though and here's a bit of information for any skunk among your cowardly lot' said mckeith
'i've offered one hundred pounds reward for the scoundrels who cut my horses' throats and robbed my drays on the road to tunumburra
there's a chance for you if you're mean enough to turn informer'
'i know nothing about that' said the organiser
'eh
well if my grass is burned i shall know who did it and so will this police inspector
and i am a magistrate and will have you arrested
get on your horse harris we'll start at once and ride alongside this chap till he's over my boundaries'
harris unhitched his horse and mounted but not sooner than mckeith was he in the saddle
then mckeith looked at last towards the veranda where bridget stood white defiant with maule at the french window of the diningroom just behind her
mckeith took off his hat made her a sweeping bow which might have included his guest turned his horse's head and rode in the direction of the sliprails harris and the sulky organiser slightly at his rear
bridget never forgot that impression of himthe dogged slouch of his broad shouldersthe grim set of his head the square unyielding look of his figure as he sat his horse with the easy poise of a bushman who is one with the animal under himin this case a powerfully made nasty tempered roan one of colin's best saddlehorseswhich seemed as dogged tempered as its master
maule showed tact in tacitly assuming the unexpected necessity for mckeith's abrupt departurealso that he had already bidden goodbye to his wife
lady bridget made no comment upon her husband's scant courtesy to his guest when she rejoined maule after an hour or two spent in housewifely business
they strolled about the garden smoked cigarettes in the veranda she played and sang to him and he brought out his cornet which he had carried in his valise being something of a performer on that instrument
a demon of reckless gaiety seemed to have entered into lady bridget
watching mckeith disappear behind the gum trees she had said to herself'i can be determined too
i have as strong a will as he has
he did not choose to say one regretful word
he was too stubborn to own himself in the wrong
he left me in whatif he believed his suspicion to be truemust be a dangerous position for a womanonly it shall not be dangerous to me
i know exactly how far i am goingexactly the amount of excitement i shall get out of it all
neither willoughby nor he deserve an iota of consideration
i shall amuse myself
so
no more
but he can't know that
he has never thought about me
he has thought of nothing but his own crossgrained pride and selfish egoism
no man of ordinary breeding or savoirfaire would have gone off like that'
she forgot in her condemnation of colin to make allowance for the primal nature of the man for a certain kinship in him with the loftier type of savage whose woman must be his wholly or else deliberately relinquished to the successful rival and into whose calculation the subtleties of social jurisprudence would not naturally enter
nor did she remember at the moment that maule had been described by her own relatives as a person of neither birth nor breedinga fortunehunternot by any means a modern bayard
he at least was a man of the world she thought and would appreciate the situation
he had lost that touch of unaccustomednessshe hardly knew how to describe itwhich had often irritated her in their former relation
in their talk that day he seemed much more at home than she was in the world she had once belonged to
he spoke of 'personages' with the ease of familiar acquaintance
apparently he had got into quite the right seta rather political set she gathered
he told her that he had been pressed to stand for a wellnursed liberal constituency and implied that but for the catastrophe of his wife's death he would now be seated in parliament with a fair prospect in the future of place and distinction
of course it was the money which had done it she told herself though he had undoubted cleverness she knew and as he pointed out his experience in a particular south american republicvery much to the fore just now in european diplomacystood to his advantage
his marriage had given him opportunity
he alluded without bad taste to his dead wife's generosity
she had left him her entire fortune unfettered
he was now a rich man
he explained that she had had none but very distant relations and that otherwise charitable institutions would have benefited
she had been a very good woman he saida woman with whom nine hundred out of a thousand decent men would have been perfectly happy
he let it be inferred that he was the thousandth man
his eyes not his lips told her the reason why
their talk skimmed the surface of vital thingsthe new awakening in england the threatenings of a socialistic upheaval his individual aims and ideasshe recognised her own inspirations
he spoke of his political ambitions
suddenly she said  'i wonder why you made the break of coming out to australiawhy you did not stay in england and follow on your career'
'there are bonds stronger than cart ropes which may drag a man by force from the path he has marked out for himself
surely you must understand'
'really mr maule'
'why will you be so formal'
he interrupted impetuously
'it is absurd
women nowadays always call men they know well by a petit nom'
'do i know you well
i often think i never knew you at all'
'that is what lady tallant used to say to me latterly about you and myselfthat we never really knew each other'
'oh poor rosamond
it makes me miserable to think of her
you became friends thenlatterly'
'she was very nice to me when she came back from leichardt's land
and besides she was anxious for me to come out to luke and help him a bit she told me about your marriage
she knew i could settle to nothingof course the world in general thought it was because of that tragedymy wife's deathand the childyou understand'
bridget nodded slowly
'lady tallant knew the truththat i was tormented by one ceaseless longingafter the impossible
i fancy she thought that if i could realise the impossibility i might get over the longing
butbridget it's no use pretendingi did try to do my duty
i think i succeeded to a certain extent in making my wife happybut there was always the same gnawing regret'  'you must put all that out of your head' she interrupted curtly
'i cannot
a man doesn't love a woman like you and because she is married to another man put her out of his headin two years or tenor eternity for that matter'
she laughed joylessly
'eternity'
she scoffed
they were in the veranda after luncheon she swinging slowly in the hammock playing with a cigarette he smoking likewise scarcely attempting to suppress the stormy feeling in his face and voice
for her the crude browngrey landscape rose and fell with the motion of the hammock and jarred with the exotic memories he evoked
she had been called back to the varied emotional interests of her girlhood and realised in a rush how deadly dull was life in the arid wastes of the nevernever
nothing more exciting than to watch the great parched plain with the dry heathaze upon it getting browner every day and the shrinking lagoon and its ever widening border of mud
nothing when she turned her eyes to right and left but ragged gum trees and black gidia forest
what a dead blank wilderness it was'
she gave a little gasp as if for breath
he seemed to read her thoughts
'do you remember romeand the campagna that first day we went to albanoand our walk through the woods down to lake neiit was then i first knew that i loved you'
'willif you are going to stay here you mustn't talk like that
it's not playing the game'
she spoke pleadingly
'does your husband play the game'
maule retorted
'is it playing the game to leave you here alone with me when he must knowor at least guesshow things have been between usdo you think i didn't notice yesterday that he suspected mesuspected us both
i should have been a blind mole not to see by his face and manner how he felt
upon my soul he would have no defenceif'  she stopped him with a gesture
'i must ask you again not to discuss my relations with my husband they do not concern you'
'do they not'
and as she rose abruptly from the hammock 'i beg your pardon' he added humbly 'i will do my best not to offend again'
he got up too and stood his back against the veranda railings
'lady bridget you mustn't be angry with me
i suppose i am a little off my balance you must remember that this isfor me a rather staggering experience'
'shall we go for a ride'
she asked suddenly
'i don't suppose you have much idea of what a wild western station is like'
'oh i'm fairly well acquainted with life on big pastures' he answered lightly taking her cue
'you would be surprised perhaps at the list of my qualifications as an outback squatter
i'm a bit of a rancherhad one in the argentinea bit of a doctora bit of a policemani was in charge once of a constabulary force out in british guiana
that's where i got a rise off harrisa bit of a law breaker tooin fact a bit of everything
yes i should enjoy a ride round here with you immensely'
'then do you mind looking for mr ninnis the overseer you know'
'yes i know ninnis
had a yarnas he'd saywith him last night while your husband was talking to harris
ninnis doesn't get on well with harrisanother point of sympathy
we're quite friends already
ninnis and ihe's been in south america too'
'you'll find him somewhere about the bachelors' quarters and i'll go and put on my habit' she said
lady bridget appeared as maule and ninnis were finishing saddling the horses
ninnis had stayed near the head station and was keeping a sharp lookout for bush fires he said
otherwise there appeared to be no elements of disquiet
lady bridget noticed with surprise that ninnis seemed to defer to maule which was not his usual attitude towards strangers
she attributed this to a community of experiences in south america and also to maule's undoubted knack of managing men
chapter    they rounded the lagoon and skirted the gidia scrub
maule was on a moongarr horse bridget rode a fiery little chestnut
maule had already had opportunity to admire the famous o'hara seat
they had hunted together once or twice on the campagna that winter when they had met in rome
it was difficult to avoid retrospect but bridget seemed determined to keep it within conventional limits
they found plenty however to talk about in their immediate surroundings
perhaps it was the effort to throw off the load on her heart that made bridget gaily confiding
she drew humorous pictures of the comic shifts the almost tragic hardships of life on the leurahow she had been left servantlessuntil ninnis had got up maggie from the lower leurawhen the chinamen decamped during the gold rush
she described the chivalrous sundowner who had on one occasion helped her through a week's washing and zack duppo the horsebreaker whose christmas pudding had been a culinary triumph and the loyalty of faithful wombo who had done violence to all his savage instincts in acting as houseservant until the advent of the malay boy kuppi
she told of her first experience of a summer out west
the frying of eggs in the sun on a sheet of corrugated zinc so intense was the heat
the terror of snakes centipedes scorpions
the plagues of flies and white ants
then how during the servantless period in utter loneliness and colin's enforced absence at the furthest outstation she had had an attack of dengue fever and no woman within forty miles of her
'and your husband allowed this
but where was that barmaidlooking person who seems to keep house here for stray gentlemenand who has the yellowheaded and blueeyed little boy'
bridget's lip curled
'mrs hensor had accepted a temporary situation at an hotel in fig tree mountthe only time i've regretted her absence' and the musical laugh seemed to maule to have acquired a note of exceeding bitterness
'perhaps you don't know' she went on 'that mrs hensor is a sort of helen of the upper leurathough unfortunately as yet no paris has carried her offi wish there was one bold enough to do it
she had to be asked to take a change of air because there was rivalry about her between the buyer of a meat preserving establishment and the chief butcher at tunumburra
fair helen scorned them both
result the two buyers bought beasts elsewhere and as you would understand on a cattle station butchers may not be flouted
though i daresay' lady bridget added with a shrug 'if i could have had the butchers in the housei draw the line only at harrisand had sung to them and played up generally i might have scored even off mrs hensor
but they wouldn't come until after she had gone and there was no further danger of a duel taking place outside the bachelors' quarters'
maule took her cue again and laughed as if the matter were one to jest about
but as he looked round his face did not suggest merriment
nor for that matter did the landscape
they were riding at the edge of the immense sandy plain patched with brown jaggled grass and parched brambles and prickly lignum vitaenothing to break the barren monotony but clumps of stunted brigalow and gidia a windmill marking the site of an empty well with the few hungrylooking cattle near it
now they dipped into a scrub of dismal gidia
'this is the most depressing country i have ever ridden through' he said
'you don't know what a difference three inches of rain makes' she answered
'then the grass is green the creeks are running and at this time the dead brambles are covered with white flowers
but it doesn't rain
there's the tragedy'
'the tragedy is that youyou of all women should be wasting your youth and beauty in this wilderness
how long is it going to last'
she shrugged again and for an instant turned her face up towards the sky
'you must ask the heavens'
'meaning i presume that like most of the australian squatters your husband hasn't capital enough at his back to stand up against continued drought'
'precisely'
she looked at him with her puzzling smile
'but you couldn't have understood his position when you married him'
'no i didn'taltogether
but i should really like to remind you that i am not in the witness box'
'i think you owe me the truth'
he said passionately
'what do you call the truth'
she asked reining in her horse and meeting his eyes straight
but she had to turn hers away before he answered and he as well as herself was conscious of the compelling effect his gaze had upon her
'i could have made you marry me if i had been strong enough to persist' he said
'cannot any man do what he is strong enough to doif he wishes it enough to persist'
'i should have put it this way
if i had thought less of you and more of myself
but after what you said that day when you jeered so contemptuously at the kind of environment in which then i should have had to place my wifewhat could i doexcept withdraw
but you suffered bridget' he went on vehemently
'not so much as i didbut still you suffered
you thought of mei felt it and you must have felt too how continually i thought of you
i used to try and make you think of medream of me
and i succeeded
isn't that true'
'yes it is true' she answered in a low voice
'only lately since i have been in the district it has seemed to me that the invisible wires have been set working afresh
isn't that true also'
'yes it is true' she said again as if forced to the acknowledgment
'then can there be any question of the bond between us
you see it's independent of time and space
for you were sorryyou did care
that's the truth you owe me
if afterafter we parted in that dreadful way i had gone back had thrown up everything had said to you come with me anywhere let us be all in all to each otheron the slopes of the andes on an island in the south seasyou would have come'
'i always told you' she said with her puzzling smile 'that the slopes of the andes appealed to me'
'peru would have been more picturesque than this anyway
is that all i can get out of youthat grudging admission
well never mind i am satisfied
you have owned up to enough
i won't tease you now for more admissions'
'i have admitted too much' she said gloomily
'the curse of the o'hara's is upon me
almost all of them have gambled with their lives and most of them have lost'
she gave her horse the rein as she spoke and they cantered on over the plain
after that she resolutely forbade sentiment
mr ninnis was gratified by an invitation that evening to dine at the home and came down in his best dark suit and his most genial mood
bridget sang
she had not been singing much lately
colin's gloom over the evil prospects of squatting on the leura reacted upon her spirits
and besides the piano had been attacked by white ants and the tuner had not been so far up the river for a long time
it was inspiring to learn that maule added to his gifts that of getting a piano into tune
ninnis promised to rummage among the tools for a key that would serve
ninnis had never admired lady bridget so much as he did this evening
certainly he thought her more flighty and incomprehensible than ever but he could not deny her fascination
it seemed quite natural to him that she should be in high spirits at seeing an old friend from england who appeared to know all her people
ninnis had taken immensely to maule
beside maule knew parts of the world where ninnis had been
it was curious to see the americanisms crop out
ninnis considered maule a person of parts and of practical experience
he said to himself that the boss had done wisely in leaving maule at the headstation while they were shorthanded
maule showed great interest in bush matterssaid he wanted to learn all he could about the management of cattlethought it not improbable that he might invest money in leichardt's land
ninnis agreed to show him round and maule begged that he might be made usefuleven offered to take a turn with the tailingmob so that moongarr bill and the other stockmen might be free to muster more cattle
nothing was heard of the blacks during the next day or two but one morning ninnis discovered that an old gun which the station hands and the blackboys were allowed to use on sundays for shooting game in the lagoon had disappeared in the night
circumstantial evidence pointed to wombo as the thief
cudgee owned to having seen him skulking among the gully rocks
a deserted gunya was found near a lonely halfdry waterhole in the scrub and there were rumours of a tribe of wild blacks having passed towards the outlying country in the breeza downs direction
no news came however of either racial or labour warfare
mckeith sent not a word of his doings and harry the blower was not due yet on his postal fortnightly round
mckeith had been gone a week and the time of his absence seemed like that sinister lull which comes after the sudden shock of an earthquake and the tornado that follows upon it
then one day something happened
all the men except the chinamen were out
moongarr bill ninnis and the stockmen on the run while maulea book and a sandwich in his pockethad gone herding with joey case and one of the extra hands
a sense of mutual embarrassment had that day driven them apart
he had been afraid of himself and she too had felt afraid
during these seven days she had rushed recklessly on as though impelled by a fatality never pausing to consider how near she might be to a precipice
whenever possible she had ridden out with maule and ninnis or with maule alone
she found relief from painful thoughts of colin in the excitement and emotion with which maule's society provided her
she went with him on several occasions behind the tailingmob though ordinarily she could not endure being at close quarters with cattle
but it interested her to see maule ride after and round up the wild ones that escaped to watch his splendid horsemanship which had the flamboyant southamerican touchthe suggestion of lariat and lasso and ornate equipment the picturesque element lacking in the bushall harmonizing with his deep dark eyes and southern type of good looks
today she had preferred to remain at home alone
she had been pulled up with a startled sense of shock
last evening when they were walking together on the veranda he had begun again to make love to her and in still more passionate earnesthad held her handshad tried to kiss her
she had found herself giving way to the old romantic intoxicationthen had wrenched herself from him only just before the meeting of lips
at last she had realized the strength of the glamour
she fought against it nevertheless in imagination gave herself up to it as the opiumsmoker or haschischeater gives himself up to the insidious fantasia of his drug
yes bridget thought it was like what she had read of the effects of some unholy drugsome uncanny form of hypnotism
for she knew that she did not really love maulethat her feeling for him was unwholesome
there was poison in it acting upon her affection for and trust in her husband
maule made subtle insinuations to mckeith's detriment injected doubts that rankled
there were no definite charges though he would hint sometimes at gossip he had heard in tunumburra
but he would convey to her in half words looks and tones that he had reason to believe colin unworthy of herthat her husband had led the life of an ordinary bushman and had fully availed himself of such material pleasures as might have come to his hand
the veiled questions he asked about mrs hensor and her boy brought back a startled remembrance of the scene outside the fig tree mount hotel and steadbolt's vague accusation
she had almost forgotten ithad never seriously thought about it
yet now she knew the midgebite had festered
could it be that there was a chapter in colin's life of which she knew nothing
was it not too much to believe that he had always been faithful to his ideal of the camp fire
ah
maule would have jeered at thatwould have been totally incapable of understanding the romance of that dreamdrivea dream in truth
but how beautiful how sane how uplifting it seemed compared with the feverish haschisch dream in which she was now living
restless under the obsession she wandered up the gully and as she sat among the rocks wrestled with her black angeland conquered
clearly there was but one thing to do
she must send maule away at once before colin came back
as for colin that trouble must be faced separately
maule must ride back to tunumburrahe knew the track
or should he wish to explore the district further harry the blower was due with the mail tomorrow and could guide him to any station on the postman's route which might appear to maule desirable
bridget knew that maule would leave the tailingmob before the other men that afternoon and would probably come to look for her here
so having arrived at her decision and wishing to put off the inevitable scene as long as possible she set forth by another route for the headstation
chapter    but she had only gone a few steps when out of the gidia scrub came oola the halfcaste her comely face bruised her eyes wild with grief and terror her head tied up in a bloodstained strip torn from lady bridget's lacy undergarment the gailyflowered kimono hanging in dirty shreds upon her brown bosom
'white mary
lathychap'
she cried
'plenty poor feller oola
plenty quick me run
me want 'em catch lathychap before pollisman come
that feller pollisman take wombo longa gaol
mithsis'the gin implored
'bujeri youmithis tell pollisman wombo plenty good blackfellow
no take wombo longa gaol'
'what has wombo been doing'
asked lady bridget
'did he steal the gun'
'yowi yes
wombo plenty frightened longa ole husband belonging to me'
and oola dropped and knocked her head upon the ground wailing the earpiercing deathwail of the australian native women
'oola you must stop howling'
said bridget alive to the seriousness of the situation
'has wombo shot your husband with our gun'
'yowi mithis
that feller husband altogether bong' dead
from oola's broken revelations bridget pieced the story
it appeared that the tribe had followed in hot pursuit of the fugitives and knowing his peril wombo had sneaked up to the headstation in the darkness possessed himself of an effectual weapon and fled away with the gun
the offended blacks had discovered the guilty pair on the outskirts of breeza downs and oola's husband with a company of braves had attacked their gunya
thento quote oola'that feller husband throw spear at wombohit oola longa cobra head with nulla nulla
him closeup carry off oola
my word
wombo catch him pho pho
plenty quick husband belonging to me tumble down'
and oola wailed anew
'where's wombo now'
bridget asked
'blackfeller yan run alonga pollisman
pollisman closeup black's camp
that feller harris catch 'im wombofetch um longa tunumburra gaol
mine think it stop tonight moongarr
closeup station now'
lady bridget at once saw through the affair
here was harris taking a legitimized revenge on wombo and doubtless also on herself
clearly he had been patrolling the breeza downs boundaries in search of unionist incendiaries and seizing wombo instead had acted promptly without waiting for a warrant or consulting mckeith
wombo would be charged at the township with theft of the gun and murder of oola's husband
to a certainty he would be hanged if the matter ran its ordinary course
that it should not do bridget declared within herselfif she could by any possibility prevent it
the halfcaste woman and the white lady went swiftly through the gidia scrub towards the headstation
at the gully crossing maule on his way back from the tailingmob overtook them and dismounting walked with lady bridget to the house
she forgot then all the scene of last evening told him the black's story begged him to help her in the rescue of wombo
he reflected for a minute or two
'we're up against harris' he said 'and harris has a grudge against all of us
but harris feels some respect for my knowledge of constabulary law which i take it is pretty much the same in most countries where there are white settlers and native races'
she looked up at him letting him feel that she was relying on his astuteness and his strength
he went on  'ninnis is mustering with moongarr bill and the others a good way off and they're camping out tonight that leaves only joe casey and the other extra hand
ninnis put me in authority here
somebody has got to take command and it must be either you lady bridget or myself
perhaps i'm the best qualified of the two'  she laughed shakily in assent
'anyway i fancy that i know how to deal with this sort of affair better than you do' he said
'will you let me manage it my own way'
she nodded
'i suppose i may assume that your husband left me in a position of some responsibility
and if i seem to be taking too much on myselfor on the other hand deferring too much to harris you'll trust me and not interfere'
there was no time for discussion had she wished to go against him
oola was shrieking and pointing frantically to the track down from the upper slip rails along which harris and his prisoner were to be seen riding
the police inspector uniformed burly triumphant exhaled the majesty of the law as he rode slightly in advance leading the blackboy
now as they pulled up at the fence wombo presented a sorry spectaclea spear wound in his left shoulder a spear graze on his leg his wrists handcuffed and his feet tied to the stirrupiron with cords so tight that they cut into his tough black flesh
harris dismounted tied wombo's horse securely to the veranda post and then made his statement which coincided with bridget's idea of what had happened
it was too late to push on to tunumburra
he proposed to lock up his prisoner at moongarr for the night
could he have the hidehouse
not long before the police inspector had locked up a horse stealer whom he had in charge in the hidehouse for a few hours while he took a meal
to bridget it seemed an irony that wombo should be imprisoned in the very room he had so lately shared with his stolen gin
she was quivering with indignant pity at sight of the sores on the black boy's legs made by the raw hide thongs and oola who had crept up the off side of the blackboy's horse was wailing anew
maule checked with a look the angry protest on lady bridget's lip and answered the police sergeant in her stead
'why certainly
i'm sure her ladyship won't object
you'll let me see to that for you lady bridget' and as she bowed her head he addressed harris again
'mr ninnis and most of the others are camping out tonight on the run and i seem to be the only responsible man in the placeof course you know that mr mckeith asked me to stop and help look after things for lady bridget if necessary'
then he complimented harris genially upon his zeal
'you've got your warrant i suppose' he asked incidentally
the police sergeant looked a little uncomfortable
'well fact is i wouldn't waste time going back to breeza downs headstation for that
mr mckeith's there and they had a bit of an alarm
those unionist skunks tried to fire the shed one night but no particular damage was done and they've dispersed
but windeatt is in such a fright of their making another attempt on his headstation that he's pushing the imported shearers on with the shearing for all he's worth and keeps any man he can get hold of on guard night and day round the house and sheds while i and my lot have been doing a bit of riding after unionists now if you please we'll have the key of the hidehouse' concluded harris
'i'd like to get my prisoner stowed away safe before i take an hour's spell myself
i'm pretty well knocked up i can tell you
no sleep at all last night watching that nigger who was tied up to a gum tree and i've been in the saddle all day'
maule proffered the usual refreshment with a deprecatory reference to lady bridget who stood stonily apart
then on pretext of getting the key of the hidehouse he had a few words with her in the office
'i'm going to take care of this' he said as she gave him the key of the padlock which secured the hidehouse door and he forthwith fastened it to the ring of his watchchain
'of course you want the blackboy to escape'
'i shall let him out myself' she answered
'that would only make mckeith more angry
i have a better plan in which you need not be implicated'
'i would rather do it myself' she said
'i'm not afraid
if it had been possible i would have cut those horrible thongs straight away and let the poor wretch get into the bush
he'll be safe at the head of the gully in the gidia scrub'
'i promise you that he shall be safe in the gidia scrub before sunrise tomorrow
trust me'
she shook her head
'but i can't take services from you after' she began hastily and then stopped
'you call that a service
yesto humanity if you like
oh i know
after yesterday evening
now you blame me for being true to myself all that has got to be settled between us bridgetfor good and all
i thought it out as i rode behind the tailingmob today
but for the moment' he fingered the key agitatedly 'bridget you must let me do this thing for you
don't refuse me that small privilege even if you deny me all others'
she waveredyielded
'very well
you can manage it better than i could
so i will accept this last favour'
'the first not the last
what have i done but cause you pain

if you knew the torture i have been going through' he checked himself
she was staring at him half frightened half fascinated
'no no
there must be an end'
'yes
there must be an end
later on we'll decide what the end is to be'
he went out to the veranda carrying the key
bridget did not follow him
she had no power either to resent or to compel him
she sat waiting
when after about a quarter of an hour he came back she was still in the office as he had left her seated by the rough table on which were the station log the store book and branding tallies
he came in triumphantly exhibiting the key
'harris wanted to take possession of this
it was lucky i had put it on my chain
however he's satisfied that wombo is securely locked up and an extra glass of grog and a hint that as he hasn't provided himself with a warrant there's no obligation on him to stand over his prisoner with a loaded gun eased his mind of responsibility
the man is in a beast of a temper though he evidently expected to be entertained down here
i hope mrs hensor will give him a good dinner
he insists on sleeping in the little room off the store veranda where he says he can keep watch on the hide house
i suppose it's all right'
bridget nodded
'i'll tell maggie'
maule asked for ointment with which to dress the blackboy's wounds and abrasions and she gave it and left him
the afternoon was drawing in
then came the sound of the herded beasts being driven to the yard at sundown and byandby of joe casey's stockwhip as he got up the milkers
the shorthandedness and disturbance of harris' arrival made everything late and the goats which should have been penned by now were busy nibbling at the passion vines on the garden fence
but all this made little impression on bridget's preoccupied brain
she had the thought of that coming interview with maule before her
oola's continuous wailing was an affliction and she gave the halfcaste a blanket and some food and told her to camp on the further side of the hide house where with eyes and ears glued by turns against the largest chink between the slabs she might see and speak to the prisoner
chapter    maule's and lady bridget's tetetete dinner was an embarrassed meal with kuppi and maggie hovering about the table
the man's eyes said more than his lips and the woman sat strained and silent or else uttered forced commonplaces
they were alone at last on the veranda with night and the vast distances enfolding them
the air was close and hot the sky banked with storm clouds and occasionally there were flashes of sheet lightning and low growls of thunder
before long the headstation was very quiet
harris had inspected the hidehouse and having assured himself of the safety of his prisoner had retired to the veranda room making a great parade of keeping his door open his gun loaded and his clothes on ready for any emergency
joe casey had gone to his hut the chinaman and the malay boy to theirs and maggie the woman servant to her own tiny room wedged in between the new house and the kitchen wing
but it was all early
at that hour maule laughingly reminded lady bridget the dining world of london would scarcely have reached the dessert stage
she would not waste time on banalities
'i've been waiting to tell you something
my mind is quite made up
i can't go on like this any longer
you must go away tomorrow'
'tomorrow'
he echoed in dismay
'yes
i've thought it out
you don't know the country but the mailman will be here tomorrow and he can show you the road'
'you are very kind why are you so anxious to get rid of me'
'surely you understand
you made me a scene yesterday
you'd go on making me scenes'
'and you'
she gave a hard little laugh
'oh
idon't want to play any more'
'you call it play
to me it's deadly earnest
i let you go once
i do not mean to let you go again'
'but you are talking wildly
don't you see that it is impossible we can be friends'
'oh
that i grant you
we must be everything to each otheror nothing'
in spite of her cold peremptoriness he could see that she was deeply agitated
that fact gave him courage
his voice dropped to the tender persuasive note which had always affected her like a spell
'my dearmy very dearest we made a great mistake once
let us forget that
death has opened the gate of freedomfor me at leastand i can only feel remorseful thankfulness
we have again a chance of happiness
we will not throw it away a second time'
'you seem to forget that if you are free i am married'
'what a marriage
call it a mad adventure'
'that may be' she said bitterly
'but it doesn't alter the fact that i did care very much for my husband'
she brought out the last words with difficulty
'did care
you put it in the past tense
you don't care for him any longer
it would be astonishing if you did
one has only to see you together oh biddy it was so like you to rush off to the other side of the world and ruin your life for the sake of some strange impracticable idea
i can follow it all'  'you are mistaken' she put in
'i think not
you married in a fit of revulsion against the conditions in which you were livingthe hollow shams of an effete civilisationthat's the correct phrase isn't it
andwell perhaps there was another reason for the revulsion and you thought you had found the remedy for it all
oh
i admit that he is very good looking and of course he worshipped youuntil he had you secure and then he reverted to the ways of his kind
nature's gentlemen usually do'  'be silent will' she exclaimed vehemently
'you don't understand'
'my dear your very anger tells me that i do understand
why
naturally your imagination was set on fire
the bush was painted to you in its most glowing colours
no doubt as you said it's a garden of eden in good seasons
wonderful vegetation glorious libertyno galling conventionsvast spacesromanceand the will o' the wisp wealth of the wild
confess now  are not my guesses correct'
'yespartly'
she spoke with reluctance
'but i remember that you used to talk to me about the joys of the wild' she added with sharp irony
'oh yes i know it all
i've been there myself
and it's only when el dorado proves a delusion that one begins to hankeri did before i met youfor the advantages of civilised existence'
'well you have secured those
why not go and enjoy them as i'm asking you to do'
'they have no value for me unless i may share them with you
bridget i can give you everything now that you once asked for'
'with your wife's money'
he drew back sharply
'ah
you can hit a man'
and there was silence for a few minutes
then he leaned closer to her and his fingers touched the gold cigarette case which lay on the arm of the squatter's chair in which she was sitting
he went on in a changed manner
'poor evelyn left her fortune to me knowing the truth
she was a noblesouled woman
i was not worthy of her
but unworthy as i may have been bridget i deserved better of my wife than your husband deserves of you
at least i did not deceive her'
'what do you mean
colin did not deceive me
that at all events is not one of his faults towards me'
'has he told you then why he keeps on his station that insolent woman and her yellowhaired blueeyed boy'
bridget started visibly
he saw that his shaft had struck the mark
but she answered calmly  'i don't know what you want to imply
i thought you knew that mrs hensor's husband was killed on one of colin's expeditions and that he looked after her and her boy on that account'
'oh yes i've heard that story
but it seemed common gossip at tunumburra that there was anotherless creditableexplanation'
she turned fiercely upon him
'you have no right to make such an abominable accusation'
'i only mention what i heard
i went about a good deal there in bar saloons and to men's gatherings
naturally i was interested in the district where by the way mckeith does not appear to be over popular
of course i attached no great importance to the gossip then
it only made me wonder
oddly enough today when i was out with the tailing mob one of the men repeated iti need not say that i stopped him
he said he'd had it as a fact from a man who was a long time in your husband's employa man called steadbolt'
again the scene in front of fig tree mount hotel flashed before lady bridget and demon doubt rose up clothed now in more material substance
her voice shook as she answered though she tried to be loyal  'steadbolt was discharged from my husband's employment
he is another of mrs hensor's rejected suitors
that speaks for itself'
'strange that mrs hensor should reject so many suitors without apparent reason' said maule
bridget did not seem able to bear any more
her head drooped upon her hands her shoulders heaved convulsively
'i don't know what to doi am alone
it's an insult to talk to me in this way'
'i want to protect you from insulti want to take you out of these miserable conditionsand there's only one way to do that' he pleaded
he took her hands in his and kissed them passionately
'oh i love you
there's nothing in the world i would not do to make you my wife
why should you hesitate
it breaks my heart to see you unappreciated neglected living the sort of rough life that might suit a labourer's daughter but which is sacrilege for lady bridget o'hara
a man had no right to condemn a beautiful refined woman like you to such a fate well there' as she murmured incoherently 'i'll not say any more about that since it hurts you
you see i respect your wishes
i'll even go away at once if you command it and leave you to form your own judgment
i will stay in leichardt's townin sydneyanywhereuntil you have decided for yourselfas i know you must dohow impossible it is for you to remain here
then i will meet you wherever you please and we will go to europe togetherbury ourselves abroadwait in any part of the world you may choose until the divorce proceedings are over and we are free to marry
you need not be afraid of scandal the thing can be kept out of the english papers
it's so far away that nobody will remember you were married to an australian
besides anything of the sort is so easily got over nowadays
my darling why do you look at me with those tragic eyes
it is not like the old biddy to be a slave to mrs grundy'
she had been listening sitting rigid in her chair her hands still in his looking at him in a strange fixed manner almost like a person in the first stage of hypnotism
now she snatched her hands away and gave a sobbing cry
'oh i'm not the old biddy
i never can be again'
'dear lovebelieve me when i promise you that you shall never have cause for regret'
he would have taken her into his arms but she drew herself back
'will you don't understand
and i don't understand myself i can't see things clearly
it's all been so suddencolin going awayyoueverything
i want to be alone
i want to find myself'
he moved aside with a slight inclination of his head as if to let her pass
'i told you that i would do anything you wish'
'you mean thatreally
then i wish you to go away at once
you said you would leave me to decide for myself
i take you at your word and i shall write to you byandby
promise me that you will go'
'i have no choice
your will is law to me
but understand dearesti am only waiting'
'it's good of you not to want to worry and argue don't you understandi couldn't bear you to be here when colin comes back
you must go to tunumburra tomorrow'
'go to tunumburra tomorrow'
he repeated blankly
'it's on the way to leuraville and you can take the steamer from there
i will write to you in leichardt's town
oh it's quite simple
the mailman will be here early
you can leave a letter saying that you are recalled'
'i understand'
her definite planning gave him hope that she had already made up her mind and that she would join him in leuraville or leichardt's town
after all that might be best
'but i shall see you again
the mailman is not here yet
i have still a few hours respite'
she made no answer at first
then 'goodnight' she said abruptly and flitted like a small white ghost along the dim veranda
'lady bridget'
his voice stopped her
it shook a little but the manner was conventional and she gained confidence from that and turned irresolutely
'lady bridget
while we've been talking about ourselves we've forgotten that unfortunate blackboy
i only want to tell you that you may depend on your wishes being carried out
i shall go to my room and watch my opportunity
trust me that's allin everything'
'thank you' she answered simply
'i do trust you'
she came back a few steps and he met her in the middle of the veranda
in one of her swift transitions of mood a humorous element in the situation seemed to appeal to her and she said with a laugh'it's comical isn't it
the two tragedies black and whitewe two herethose two out there'
just then the black curtain of cloud that had been rising slowly and obscuring the stars was torn by a strong flash of chain lightning
it threw up her face in startling clearness and he saw in strange blend with the conflicting emotions upon it the wraith of her old whimsical smile
he did not answer her laugh
in truth the man's nature was stirred to a more deepreaching extent perhaps than ever in his life before
it may have been the flash of lightning recalling a momentary flash of illumination that had once shone upon his own soul
that had been when he was kneeling by the bedside of his dying wife and her last words revealed to him a magnanimity of devotion for which he had been wholly unprepared
he had thought her merely amiable and stupidexcept in her love for himand his sentiments towards her had been a mixture of boredom and the tolerant consideration due to the bestower of substantial benefits
nevertheless she had awakened during a spasm of remorseful selfabasement some nobler quality latent in the man
and nowas that flash of lightning illuminated bridget's face and made him keenly sensitive to the charm of her personalityher wayward fascination her inconsistencies her weakness her temperamental craving for dramatic contrast her reckless toying with emotionby a curious law of paradox there came back upon willoughby maule that scene with his dying wife and he had again the flashing perception of something sacred unexplainable to which his own nature could not reach
it sobered him
he had had the impulse to snatch her to his breast to seal the halfcompact with a lover's kiss so passionate that the memory of it must for ever bind her to him
but the impulse was past
they stood perfectly silent stiff in the intervalit seemed a very long onebetween the lightning flash and the distant reverberation of thunder which followed it
then he said mechanically like one walking out of a dream
'there's going to be a storm
are you frightened'
'no' she answered
'i'm never frightened of storms'
and added 'besides colin would be so glad of rain'
before he could reply she had glided away again and he was alone
he thought it strange that she should be thinking of her husband and his material interests just then
chapter    it must have been a little while after midnight when bridget was awakened by more thunder and lightning and a confused tornado of sound
she had been dreaming that harris was throwing her from the gully cliffs on to the boulders in its bedonly it seemed to her bewildered senses that the boulders rose towards her instead of her descending to meet them
next she discovered that rain was pattering on the zinc roof and that the violent concussions she felt beneath her must be due to the horns of goats knocking up against the boards of her bedroom
ah
she thought the men had forgotten to pen the goats and they were sheltering from the rain in the open space under the floor of the house
there could be no more sleep for her that night unless they were dislodged
she waited through the din until there came a lull in the storm then got up and put on her shoes and a waterproof coat over her nightdress
it was not the first time by any means that when sleeping alone she had been obliged to rise and drive away stray animals that had been inadvertently allowed means of entrance
she went out to the back veranda which was connected by steps with the verandas of the other two wings
the moon was full and shed occasional pale gleams through the scudding clouds
the close heat had given place to a chill wind and the rain came down intermittently but in no volumeit could not make much difference to the parched earth
there was not a light visible anywhere
the goats were still making a noise under the house
lady bridget got a stick from a heap of sandalwood boughs stacked against the veranda and passing to the front where the piles supporting the house were higher proceeded to belabour an elderly nanny who with her mate was now nibbling twigs of the creepers
but she was surprised to see only two or three goats she had thought there must be many more
the animals were refractory and her beatings of no avail
now suddenly she was seized with a fit of nervous shivering and realised that she felt physically ill
it was of no use for her to try and drive off the goats
she sank down on the veranda steps of the old humpey and afterwards thought she must have fainted
the sound of maule's approaching footsteps and his alarmed ejaculation seemed to bring her to herself
he appeared to have come round the back of the old humpey
he was horrified at the sight of her convulsive shivering
'you mustn't stop here' he exclaimed
'i was afraid the goats would disturb you and i've been getting them out as quietly as i could
most of them are shut up in their fold'
she saw that he was almost fully dressed
with an effort she controlled her terror and asked  'you've not been asleep'
'oh
off and on
i've been keeping my eye on harris' room' he pointed across the yard to the kitchen and storebuilding oppositeat the end of which harris had installed himselfto the squat outline of the slab and back hide house
'my ear too' he went on 'for harris' slumbers are neither silent nor peaceful
when he's not snoring he groans and stirs and the worst of it is that he's got his door wide open on to the veranda and his bed right across the window that looks straight at the door of the hide house
i thought i'd take advantage of the thunder but it was no good
he was awake and looking out
now he has lain down again and as soon as i hear him snoring i shall try once more'
a fresh fit of shivering seized bridget
'this won't do' he said and went hurriedly into his own room which opened a few doors down on to the veranda and coming back with an opossum rug on his arm and a glass of brandy and water in his hand he made her drink the spirits and wrapped the rug round her
presently the shivering ceased
a moongleam between two clouds closing on each other showed her his eyes glowing with sombre passion
she saw that he was holding himself under stern restraint
though where they were the veranda running between the end of the old humpey and the new house made a kind of passage so that they were in shadow there was a possibility of watchful eyes discovering their whereabouts
'will you go back to your room and i'll get rid of these goats' he said trying to speak in a matteroffact way
'i supose there isn't a yard where i could put them nearer than their own by the lagoon'
'i don't think so' she answered dully and without stirring from where she crouched upon the steps
when he urged her anew to go back to bed she answered petulantly  'oh do let me be
i like the wind and the rainthey're soothing
and i couldn't sleep now until i know that wombo is safe in the scrub'
he made no further protest but set to work shepherding the goats
she watched him drive them out of the gate till his dark form and the piebald shapes he was driving before him were lost in the night
she knew that it would take some little time to pen them all securely in their fold
but the night was young yet
from shivering the fire of the brandy and the warmth of the fur rug had turned her temperature to fever heat
she felt keenly excited the blood in her veins seemed boiling and the occasional raindrops and moist wind were pleasant on her face
she had gone to the end of the veranda and stood there with long withes of the native cucumber vine that grew over the old humpey swaying around her in the breeze
there was not a light in the place
even moon and stars were now veiled
her brain raced round desperate and futile schemes for eluding the vigilance of the police inspector
she wished now that she had thought of asking him to dinner and putting opium into his coffeethat was the sort of thing they did in novels
she did not know that a less developed brain than her own was working at this moment to the same end on an inspiration from the bush debildebil or such savage divinity as watches over the loves of the blacks
she saw what at first she had thought part of the shadow of a neighbouring gum tree cast on the strip of grass that ran at the back of the old humpey
but the lesser shadow moved halted and the greater shadow was stationary and grew denser as the moon sailed again across a clear patch of sky
then bridget realised that the moving shadow was the halfcaste oola shrouded in the dark blue blanket she had given her and that the gin had halted at the casement window of maule's bedroom
now oola with her hands on the sill curved her lithe body drew her bare feet to the window ledge and dropped within
bridget ran along the grass to the window and from there watched oola move about the room and in the almost darkness fumble among the objects on the dressingtable
then bridget could hear the little click of the tongue and the guttural note of exultation a black tracker gives when he comes upon a trail
bridget drew aside against the wall so that oola again springing over the window sill did not observe her
but bridget saw the watch and chain with the iron key attached to it which the gin had stolen and seized oola's arm as the dark form crouched upon the grass again
the gin uttered a smothered shriek
bridget took the watch from her hand detached the key from the chain and slipped watch and chain into the pocket of her coat while oola clutching lady bridget's knees pleaded chokily  'mithsisyou gib me keyno make im noise
no tell pollisman me let out wombo
my word
plenty quick he yan longa scrub
baal pollisman catch wombo
mithsisbujeri white mary
you gib it key to oola'
the key was in oola's hand
'baal me tell' whispered bridget
'you go quick'
she too bent her body and followed oola who sped like a hunted hare round the comer of the old humpey
now she wriggled in the shadow of the yard railings
now she crept stealthily past harris' windowandoh
debildebil be praised
the police sergeant's stertorous snoring was clearly audible
blessed likewise be the retiring moon and the sweeping clouds
lady bridget every nerve aquiver and the rushing blood throbbing in her temples also crept noiselessly beneath the window in the wake of oola crawling like oola but more to the back of the hidehouse into the shelter of its drooping bark eaves
bending cautiously round the slabs she watched as the gin with a swift wriggling motion like that of a snake drew herself along the sunken earth floor beneath the eaves and then softly raising herself to the level of the padlock put in the key
there was a muffled grating of iron under the gin's hand as the padlock unclosed and the hasp dropped then a creak of the door on its hinges while it opened and shut behind the undulating shape in the aperture
then a low throaty ejaculationthe black's call of warning
and now with a quickness incredible the wriggling movement of two blanketshrouded serpentine shapes round the hidehousein and out among the grass tussocks and the low herbage now hidden for a moment by friendly gum shadows in the dimness now dark moving blurrs upon the lesser darkness and now altogether invisible  lady bridget knew that in five minutes once they could be upright again the fugitives would have reached the gully and after that the gidia scrub
then security from the terrors of a white man's gaol would be almost assured to them
lady bridget waitedwaited it seemed to her an eternity in reality it was barely over the five minutes she had mentally given the two blacks for their escape
that five minutes had been full of alarms and she could feel her heart thumping so tense was the strain
she had to consider the possibility of harris being awakened also of maule's return and an attempt on his part to free the hidehouse prisoner
also there was the danger of the clouds breaking before she had done her work
she heard a movement of the sleeper in his bed below the open window opposite
harris might have been aroused and perhaps have stirred without awakening
but the snoring had ceased she did not think however that he could be fully awake
presently the snoring recommenced
she crept very slowly along the earthen floor drawing her hands along the slabs as she went
a splinter from one of them ran into her fingerbut that did not matter
now she touched the door which lay back towards her for the blacks had not waited to close it
she pushed it very softly holding her breath at the creak of the hinge and listening intently for the recurrent snore which sounded through the window only three paces from her
at last the thing was donethe padlock fastened the key turned in the lock and now in her pocket
she dropped flat on the earth her cloak drawn lightly between her knees and wriggled snakelike as oola had done past harris' windows then pushed herself on hands and knees along the ground squeezing her body against the palings of the yard till she reached the old humpey on the opposite side
once round that corner she got on to her feet feeling sick and giddy but intensely relieved
she leaned against the gum tree which had protected oola and now realised that it had been raining in a driving gust and that she was wet to the skin
the bleating of a kid which had been left under the house and had found its way into the yard startled her anew
she thought that she heard sounds in the wing near the hidehousesteps on the veranda
was harris stirring
had he discovered the flight of his prisoner
she waited again till all was quiet
by this time there was a watery radiance just overhead
she looked towards the lagoon but there was no sign of maule
she felt the shivering begin again though her head seemed burning and she could hardly think collectedly
her chief idea was to get back to bed
but she was able to reason to herself that maule must somehow be informed of the escape
she did not think he could have got back yet to the spot where he had left her
or he might come straight to his room and miss the key and his watch
in any case these must be restored to the place from which oola had taken them
she lifted herself to the windowsill as oola had done and in a moment was inside the room
it had been an easy enough business only that in clutching the window frame the jagged end of the splinter she had run into her hand caught and tore her flesh
the room was of course empty
she lifted a candlewhich with matches stood on the dressing tableand put back the watch and chain and the key now separate from them
that fact would show maule that it had been tampered with
but she must find some more exact means of conveying what had happened
premature action on his part might give the alarm
her brain worked in flashes
she had vivid ideas which in her fevered state she could not hold properly
she must write to maule
a notebook that he must have taken from his pocket lay on the table also
she tore out a leafpausedshe must write so that only he would understand
an accident might happen to the paper
there must be no definite statement to implicate him or herself
some words in french occurred to her
she wrote them down and continued the note in that language
at the close she begged him to act so that there should be no ground for suspicionreminded him of his promise to go away on the morrowsaid she would write to him at the post office at leuraville
she did not sign the sheet but folded it acrossaddressed it to maule and laid it under the watch on the table
a fresh spasm of shivering seized her
suddenly she remembered the opossum rug she had left
she opened the door leading from maule's room into the veranda and went out
she stood bewilderedly looking across the faintlit yard to the dim veranda of the kitchen wing opposite as she fought against the sick faintness that threatened to overcome her
then she walked along the veranda to the place where she had parted from maule
the rug was lying there and she threw it round her and waited on the steps with chattering teeth and shaking limbs
in a minute or two he joined her
she saw by the fitful moonbeams that he was wet and muddytruly in a worse plight than herself
she could hardly speak for the rigor
seeing her condition he took her up in his arms and carried her along the veranda towards her own room
the clasp of his arms the warmth of his body even through his wet clothing helped her to steady herself
she continued to tell him of the great achievement
'wombo has escapedi saw oola taking the key out of your room
harris was asleepsnoring
she let wombo out and i locked the door of the hidehouse again afterwards and put the key back in your room
it's all rightnothing can be found out till the morning
they're safe in the scrub by now'
'well i'm thankful for that at any rate' he answered
'but at this moment i cannot think of anything or anyone but you
my dearesti'm so afraid of your being illwhat can i do'
'nothing
i have sal volatile in my roomstuff to take for a cold
i only want to get off my wet things and go to bedi can sleep now
don't be frightened about me'
she staggered when he put her gently down inside her own door but recovered herself courageously lighted her candles laughed at her own disordered appearance bade him go at once and look after himself
he kissed her hand reluctantly
'till tomorrow'
she looked at him alarmedly
'will
but you have promised me
you are going away tomorrow'
he did not reply
his eyes were roving round the chamber dimly lighted by the two candles
he was observing the feminine details the untidinesses so characteristic of her the daintinesses equally characteristicall in such odd contrast with inevitable bush roughnesses
he noticed the silver and ivory on the dressingtable the large silverframed photographsan autographed one of the queen of wartenburgmolly gaverick and rosamond tallant in court veil and feathers joan gildea at her typewriterthe confusion of books the embroidered coverlet on the large bed the bushmade couch at its foot upholstered in rosepatterned chintz on which she had seated herself
'you have got to go' she urged
'whatever happens you are leaving here with the mailman tomorrow
promiseon your word of honourthat nothing shall hinder you'
'of course i shall keep my promise though it breaks my heart to leave you like this
but i knowi feel that the parting will not be for long
yes' as she slowly shook her head and a strange fateful look shadowed the feverish brightness of her eyes
'i couldn't leave you if i didn't feel certain of that'
'oh i'm tired out
i'm tireddead tired' her face was ghastly her lips like burning coals
'i can't argue any more
and now it's goodnightgoodbye'
'not goodbye
at least there will be time tomorrow for that'
'you must gogoodnight'
he left her but waited in the veranda reassuring himself by the sound of movements on the other side of the closed door
when all was silent and the candles extinguished he went back to his own room
he saw on the dressingtable his watch and chain with the key detached beside thema confirmnation of the truth of what lady bridget had told him
but she had forgotten to tell him of the note she had left also and naturally he did not look for it
had he known and looked he would have discovered that the note was gone
chapter    lady bridget always looked back upon the next few days as a confused nightmare
she awoke in the grip of feverthat malarial kind which is common in australiatried to get up as usual but fell back upon her bed faint and dizzy
her brows ached
she had alternations of burning heat and icy coldness
there came active periods in the dull lethargy which is often a phase of fever and from which she only roused herself at the spur of some urgent call on her faculties
one of these was willoughby maule's anxious message of enquiry conveyed by maggie to which she had the presence of mind to return the answer that she had caught cold and was staying in bed for the present but would no doubt be quite well shortly
also that she was sorry not to bid him goodbye but begged that he would not think of postponing his departure
she heard as in a dream the sound of the mailman's arrival and presently of the saddling of horses in the yard and then the clopclop of their feet as they were ridden past her end of the house to the gully crossing
there were two horses
so maule had left the headstation with harry the blower as she had bidden him do
she was conscious of relief
she realised in bewildered fashion that maule was gone out of her life at moongarr and connected the sound of his horses' departing feet with the thud of sir luke tallant's hall door when he had left her at the first interview which had led to their final quarrel
from that effort of memory she sank again into mental coma
maggie took it to be natural sleep and laid the mailbag just brought by harry the blower on her mistress' bed to await her awakening
much later in the day on the return of mr ninnis and the other men from their cattlemuster finding the bag still untouched maggie broke the seals at her mistress' dazed order and having sorted out lady bridget's letters carried away the bag for ninnis to take his own mail
but lady bridget paid no heed to her letters and thus it happened that for the time being she was quite unaware of an event which was of great importance to her
she had been scarcely even distantly conscious of the hue and cry and general excitement at the headstation when it was discovered that the prisoner had escaped
harris had his own suspicionsit might be said his certainties but the man's crafty nature bade him keep his accusations for an opportunity when he ran less risk of being worsted
he meant to wait until mckeith's return
meanwhile what he had not been prepared for was willoughby maule's departure with the mailman before he himself came back from an unsuccessful hunt after the fugitives
that move had lain outside his calculations
he had gleaned enough from mrs hensor as well as from his own observation to feel sure that maule and lady bridget were in love with each other and he had never supposed that they would part so abruptly
the headstation was very shorthanded in the absence of ninnis and the stockmen and harris had been obliged to go out by himself on the manhunt
he did not know the country at the head of the gully where he concluded that wombo was hiding and lost himself in the gidia scrub
thus he was in a very disagreeable temper when he at last arrived at the bachelors' quarters
to lady bridget the day passed and all the seemingly distant noises of it like a phantasmagoria of vision sound impressionsthe echoes of station activity the chinamen's pidgin english as they weeded the front garden tommy hensor's voice when he brought the cook a nestful of eggs some vagrant hen had laid in the grasstussocks the men going forth with the tailingmoband at intervals the scorching recollection of that hinted scandal concerning colin and mrs hensor of which maule had told her horrible unbelievable and yet  then after a long while with lucid breaks in the dreamy stupor she heard the roar of ninnis' incoming mob of wild cattle from the range
she could even wonder whether he had been able to muster that herd of five hundred or so for the saleyards
she knew that her husband was counting upon the sale of these beastsprobably at  pounds a headto enable him to fight the drought by a speedy sinking of artesian bores
she felt herself reasoning quite collectedly on this subject until the roar of beasts turned into the roar of the mighty atlantic breaking against the cliffs below castle gaverick she saw the green wavesreal as the heaving backs of the cattlealive leaping and she herself seemed tossed on their crest she saw and felt the cool embrace of the wavefairies she had once tried to paint for joan gildea's book oh
she had never fully appreciated the strength of that now inappeasable longing for the celtic home the celtic traditions which had been born in her
she had never known how much she loved castle gaverick how much she loathed the muggy heat the flies and the mosquitoes now brought by last night's rain the fierce glare beating upon the veranda the sunmotes dancing on the boards
the appearance late that evening of mrs hensor who having heard the mistress was ill had come down partly from curiosity partly from genuine humanity to see what might be amiss was the next thing that roused lady bridget from her feverlethargy
'maggie told me you'd been out in the rain last night and had caught cold and i thought mr mckeith would wish me to ask if i could do anything' mrs hensor said
lady bridget sat up in bed for the moment her most haughty self
'thank you but there's no occasion for you to trouble mrs hensor
i would have sent for you if i had required your services'
'and i'm not aware that i was engaged to give them' snorted mrs hensor
'it was out of consideration for mr mckeith that i came
i've got quite enough to do at the quarters and i'm really glad not to have to trouble myself down herewhat with mr ninnis wanting extra cooking and mr harris in such a rage over wombo's getting awayi'm wondering if you heard anything last night of that lady bridget
and harris is put out too over mr maule going off with harry the blower while he was hunting for the blackboy
however' mrs hensor concluded 'the master will be here tomorrow to see into the rights of things'
'how do you know that the master will be here tomorrow'
asked bridget sharply
'harry the blower brought me a letter from mr mckeith' replied mrs hensor with malign triumph
'i suppose he thought you'd be too busy doing things with mr maule to bother over the station affairs and that mr ninnis might be out on the runand so he wrote to tell me what he wanted done as he often used to before'
lady bridget closed her eyes and leaned back against the pillows trying hard to control the muscles of her face and not to betray her mortification
moreover she was certain that mrs hensor had stated the exact truth
'i should prefer to be alone' she said feeling the woman's eyes upon her
'then i'll go as you don't want me' returned mrs hensor
'but if i was you lady bridget i'd take a dose of laudanum and get myself into a perspiration for i believe it's a touch of dengue fever you've got the matter with you'
a touch of dengue in tropical australia may be serious or the reversesharp and short and critical or tedious and less dangerous
lady bridget's case was the sharp short kind demanding prompt treatment
when mckeith came home the following day he found her delirious and incapable of recognizing him
worn out as was the strong man's framenot only with wild jealousy and tortured love but with sleepless nights of patrol work days in the shearingshed sharp fighting with a second conflagrationfortunately put out before much damage had been doneand a final dispersion of unionist forces colin never for one instant relaxed his watch by bridget's bedside
all night he tended her fighting the fever as he had fought the fire at breeza downs plying her with continued fomentations dosing her with quinine laudanum and the various medicines he had found efficacious
for never was a better doctor for malarial fever than colin mckeithhe had had so much experience of it
when towards morning she fell into a profuse sweating and he had to change and wring out the blankets in which he had wrapped her he knew that the fever danger was past
she awoke at midday from a deep healthrestoring sleep so weak however that her bones felt like water and her face looked as white as the pillow case
but her brain was clear
she saw that there was no one else in the room which was still in great disorder
the blankets hot and heavy were almost unbearable but she had not strength to fling them off
it felt frightfully warm for the time of year and the air that came in through the open french window seemed to be blowing from an oven
the sky as she glimpsed it from her bed between the veranda eaves and the railings looked curiously dark and had a lurid tinge
lifting herself slightly she became aware that colin was in the veranda with his back to her looking out over the plain
the set of his figure as he bent forward with his hands on the railings and his eyes apparently strained towards the horizon reminded her of the determined hunch of his square shoulders and the dogged droop of his head when he had ridden away with harris and the organizer
she called faintly 'colin'
he turned round instantly and came to the bed
she stared up at him frightened at the look in his face something dreadful must have happened
she was too weak to go over coherently in her mind the sequence of events and feelings
she only sensed a menacing spectre monstrous terrifying
she could not realise her own share in the catastrophe she felt was impending
she could not believe that colin could change so much in less than ten days
everything had come about with such incredible swiftness
his face looked haggard ravaged
the cheeks seemed to have fallen in
the features were rigid as if cut out of metal
the whites of his eyes between the reddened lids were very bloodshot and the eyes themselves seemed balls of blue fire
there was not a shade of kindliness in them only the gleam of a fixed purpose which no entreaties would alter
she could imagine that he might have looked like that when as a boy he had beheld the mutilated bodies of his father mother sisters stretched stark after the blacks had done their hideous work
and it was true that he did feel now somewhat as that boy had felt for again to his tortured imagination that which he held dearest seemed to be lying foully murdered before his eyes
she his love had been ravished from him and he could only regard her as dead to him for evermore
'colin' she gasped
'what is the matter'
the muscles of his face relaxed it seemed automatically as if there were no soul behind
he laughed a dry ironic laugh
'never mind
you mustn't speak'
he felt her pulse examined her as a doctor might have doneall without a word and straightened the blankets and pillows
'you must have food' he said and went out
she heard him calling maggie
after a few minutes he came back with a tumbler of beaten egg and milk to which he had added brandy and told her she must drink it
her hand was too weak to hold the tumbler
he put one arm under the pillow raised her head and held the glass to her lips until she had drunk every drop of the mixture
all this with no show of tenderness or one unnecessary word
she needed the nourishment and stimulant and after them felt better
'i remember
i must have been ill what was the matter with me'
'dengue' he answered shortly
'i was out in the rain
i got a chill i remember'
'oh you were out in the rain
i should have thought you could have done what you wanted without that'
the bitterness of his tone was galllike
and again the ironic laugh
she winced and drew her head aside
he took away his arm instantly from behind the pillow and straightened himself looking down on her still with that dreadful light in his eyes
she could not bear it and turned her head away from him
'don't look at me
i'm going to get up'
'no i think you'll stay where you are'
his voice broke slightly but hardened again
'i won't talk to you
i won't let you speak a word yet that will come afterwards'
'but i don't understand'
'better not now
i'll tell you this
you're through the fever
it won't come back if you do as i tell youyou understand something about dengue
you'll stop here till you're stronger
you've got to take the brandy eggs and milk till you feel sick of it
today you'll have slops
i've told maggie about preparing your food if the fever comes backit won't if you keep quietbut if it doeshot bottlesblanketslaudanumi've mixed the dosesuntil you get into a sweat
remember that
and you'll have someone in your room tonight'
'in my roomyou
what do you mean'
'it won't be mei'm going away'
'going awaywhat is it'
she noticed that he turned and looked at the sky
'why is it so darkand the heat so stifling'
she asked
'these damned unionists have fired the only good pasture left on moongarr
it's been burning since two o'clock this morning
i sent the men out
now i'm going myselfto save what i can'
he left the room abruptly
in a minute or two she heard him outside calling 'cudgee harris'and then giving the order to saddle up
she got out of bed and tottered to the window
she could see now the wide range of the disaster
the lurid haze was spreading
the horizon shrinking and the air was hotter than ever
the fire seemed still a long way off but there was nothing to stop the flames if once they reached the great plain
the course of the river here at best a mere string of shallow waterholes was quite dry
the rain of the other night had been too insignificant and local to do any good
the brown mudstrip round the lagoon below was not perceptibly diminished
she knew that the narrow water channels flowing from their one working artesian bore must soon be licked up by the flames
and the bore in process of construction was at a standstill for want of workmen
bridget gazed out despairingly towards the shrinking horizon and upon the parched plain with the rugged clumps of dun coloured gum trees scattered upon itthe near ones looking like trees of painted tin sunblistered
the swarms of flies mosquitoes in the veranda offended her
she disliked the cattle dogs mooching round with hanging jaws and slavering tongues
the ferocious chuckle of a great grey kingfisherthe bird which white people called the laughing jackassperched on the branch of a gum tree beside the fence made her shudder because the bird's soulless cachinnation seemed an echo of colin's laugh
ah
that was the bush undivested of romancehard brutal vindictive in spite of the mocking verdure of her honeymoon spring and colin was a part of the bush
he resembled it
he too could be strong and sweet and tender as the great blossoming white cedar down by the lagoon as rills of running water making the plain greenwhen his desires were satisfied
and he could be brutal and vindictive likewise when anyone dared to thwart his will and defy his prejudices
she staggered about the room feminine instinct prompting her to freshen her appearance to change her soiled crumpled nightdress to throw a piece of lace over her dishevelled head to pull up the linen sheets which had been rolled clumsily to the foot of the bed so that the blankets could be wrapped round her
but she sank again presently exhausted on her pillows
in a short time mckeith came back booted and spurred and stood as before looking at her with forbidding sternness
'you'd better have stopped quiet
i've told mrs hensor to come down and look after you
she knows what to do'
bridget cried out passionately 'i won't have that woman in my room
how dare you tell her to come near me'
'dare
that seems a queer way to put it
however you can order her out if you don't want her
there's maggieand i'm sending ninnis back tonight'
'when are you coming home'
'i can't say
i've got things to doand to think about'
his words and his manner seemed to convey a sinister meaning
'i seeyou are angry about the blackboy
if you want to know i will tell you exactly what happened'
he laughed again and his laugh sounded to her insulting
'oh i know what has happened
you needn't tell me
i had some conversation with harris this morning
i know everything and now i've got to settle in my own mind how things are to go on'
she went very white and repeated dully 'howthingsare to go on'
'between you and me
you don't imagine do you that they can go on the same'
'no' she retorted with spirit 'certainly they can't go on the same'
maggie had come along the veranda and was at the french window
'mr harris says he's ready sir and the horses'  'all right'
mckeith went out of the door but turned and paused as if he were going to speak to his wife
but he thought better of it and walked rapidly awayperhaps because she avoided his look
she supposed that he was infuriated with her because of her part in wombo's escape and she thought his anger unjust
no doubt too he suspected maule's connivance and she knew that he was furiously jealous of maule
but surely he would understand that she must have sent maule away
what more can a wife do in the case of an overinsistent lover
and how should a husband expect an explanation when he had literally thrown her into her lover's arms or at least had left her defenceless against his solicitations
had he treated her differently after the wombo episode in the beginning she might have told him the truth about her former relations with willoughby maule
as things had been it was rather for maule than for colin that she found excuse
she was bitterly hurt and offended against her husband
oh yes
he was right
they could never again be the same to each other
if he had come back penitent pleading for forgiveness overwhelmed with contrition at her dismissal of maule she might then perhaps have explained everything and they might have become reconciled
but now his vile temper his insupportable manner his dominant egoism made any attempt of conciliation on her part impossible
she had a temper tooshe told herself and her anger was righteous
and she also had an egoism that wouldn't allow itself to be trampled on
she had rightsof birth of breeding to say nothing of her rights of wifehood and womanhood for which she must insist upon respect
if he would not bend to her even to show her ordinary consideration and courtesy then she would not lower her pride one iota before him
thoughts of this kind went through her mind as she lay smarting under the burning sense of outrage until the reappearance of mrs hensor
then the new effort she made in sending away the woman exhausted brain and body and left her with scarcely the power to thinkcertainly not to reason
chapter    but lady bridget did not know what had followed upon her husband's homecoming
she had not been in a condition to realize how all night through he had tended her putting aside every other consideration giving no heed to the affairs of the station refusing to see the police inspector who had sent in an urgent message soon after his arrival
only when turning for a moment to the veranda and noticing the red glare in the sky had he been startled out of his absorption in his wife's illness
in ordinary circumstances he would have been on his horse in a twinkling and riding as for life to fight the worst foe a squatter has to face in times of drought
he knew that if the fire spread it might mean his ruin
as it was he rushed up to the quarters to rouse ninnis and send him with moongarr bill and all available hands to do what he could in arresting the flames
but he himself dared not leave bridget till the fever was down and the crisis past
that could not be till she had awakened from the deep sleep into which she had fallen
with the sight of her in that sleep however the pull on his forces slackened though he was still too strungup to think of snatching even an hour's sleep for himself
he watched alternately the bush fire and bridget's face thinking his own dour thoughts the while
every now and then he would creep on tiptoe to the veranda railings and gaze out upon the lurid smoke which it seemed to him was thickening over the horizon
when the sun was risen he washed and dressed and went up to the bachelors' quarters where mrs hensor was already about and gave him tea and food which he badly needed
from her he learned a considerable amount of what had been going on at moongarr
from the police inspector a little later he learned a good deal more
harris' manner was portentous he asked for a private interview in the office saying that he had stayed on purpose to see the boss because his tale was impossible to write
then he told his own version of the capture and locking up of wombo taking blame on himself for having left the key of the hidehouse in maule's possession
'but you see boss he twitted me a bit about not having a warrant and there's no doubt wherever he's learned it that the chap has got the whole constabulary layout at his finger endsbesides having the ear of the governor and the executive down in leichardt's town
he's got money too no end of it
they were saying in tunumburra that his wife left him a quarter of a million'
'go onthat's nothing to do with us' put in mckeith gruffly
'he's an old friend of her ladyship's i understand' sniggered harris
'what the devil has that got to do with wombo'
said mckeith furiously
harris drew in his feelers
'i wouldn't swear that it had mr mckeith and i wouldn't swear that it hadn't
all i know is that mr maule had the key of the hidehouse in his bedroom that night and being a close friend of her ladyship's he was no doubt aware that she didn't relish the notion of wombo's being had up for theft and murderi'm not saying who it was let out wombo
it's a mystery i don't take upon myself to fathomi'll leave that to you'
'there's one easy solution of the mystery that doesn't seem to have occurred to you' said mckeith
'the gin oola could easily have stolen the keythey're cunning as the devilhalfcastesand as treacherousi know themi've had my own good reasons for not letting one of them inside the fence of my headstation'
'that may bei can only say what i know and you can form your own opinion'
'say what you know theni'm waiting to hear
but be quick about it man i've no time to waste this morning'
harris began his talehow he had watched at the window of his little room till after midnight his gun ready his eyes glued on the padlocked door opposite how overcome with drowsiness against which he had vainly struggled'for a man that's been pretty near two days and nights in the saddle may be excused if his eyes begin blinking' harris put it
he had dropped dead asleephe confessed itat his post
then how on awakening suddenly for no apparent reason all seeming quiet around he had got up as he was half dressed and in his bootshad stepped across to the hidehouse had found the padlock intact and hearing no sound had concluded the blackboy was inside safe asleep
how then with a relieved mind he had been going back to his stretcher when the noise of a goat bleating had set him on the lookout from his veranda
how presently looking at the veranda opposite he had seen the door of mr maule's bedroom open and a woman come out how she had stood a few moments facing him with the moonlight straight on her so that there was no possibility of his making a mistake
harris paused
mckeith glared at the man who had he been quick at psychological interpretations would have read an awful apprehension underlying the illrestrained fury in the other's face
the question came in hoarse jerks
'whatwhowho was it you saw'
'it was the lady bridget boss
i'  before he could proceed a strong arm struck out and mckeith's hand clutched at the police inspector's neck
'you hound
you contemptible skunk
take back that lie or i'll throttle it in your throat'
harris was of powerful build also and moreover knew some tricks of defence and assault
he freed himself by a dexterous duck of his head and a sharp shake of his body and stepped backward so that the office table was between him and his antagonist
his face was scarlet his bull's eyes protruded from their full sockets
but he was wary and not anxious to provoke the devil in mckeith
'wait a bit' he said thickly
'if you'll keep your hands off me and let me finish what i was going to say i'll show you the proof that i'm not telling you liesthough you're mistaking my meaning in regard to her ladyship  'leave her ladyship out of it will you' mckeith snarled his teeth showing between his tense lips
'i would do that willingly boss for there's no disrespect intended i can assure you
only it means that this wombo business will have to be reported and if you can help me to the right evidencewell so much the pleasanter for all parties' returned the police inspector craftily
mckeith made a slight assenting movement of his head but said nothing
his brows puckered and he stiffened himself as he listened strung to the quick while harris continued
'welli did seethat lady'the volcanic gleam from mckeith's eyes stopped him from pronouncing lady bridget's name
'i saw her come out of that room' he jerked his thumb along the veranda
'the moon was right on her just then
i saw her give a shivershe'd been out in the wet
then she walked up the veranda to where there's the covered bit joining on to the old humpey and i noticed her sit down on the steps'  'stop' broke in mckeith
'if you were on the veranda over there you couldn't have seen as far as the steps'
'right you are boss
but i wasn't waiting on the veranda
when the lady turned her back i moved into the yard and i was standing by that flowerbush'again he jerked his thumb this time to the centre bed and a young bohinia shrub covered with pink blossoms 'if you try yourself from there you'll find you can look slick through to the front garden
that's where i saw maule step out ofi guessed he'd come round by the back of the old humpey
i guessed too he thought she oughtn't to be sitting out there in the dampshe was shivering againshe'd put a rug that was lying on the steps round her
he just picked her up in his arms and carried her right along and when i stepped across i saw him take her into one of those rooms at the end of the front veranda'  a muffled growl something like the sound a hunted beast might make when the dogs had got to touch of him came from mckeith
again he stiffened himself his lips hard pressed his eyes on harris' face
the police inspector avoided his gaze but he too was watchful
'you see i was thinking of my prisoner and wondering if there could be anything afoot about him
so as i knew there was nobody thenin mr maule's room i went back and looked in
i wanted to make sure if i could where the key of the hidehouse might be
there was a candle left alight and i saw the key right enough on the chest of drawers beside maule's watch and chain
it never came into my mind then that anybody could have used it
i noticed a bit of folded paper under the watch
that's it mr mckeith
there's the proof that i am not lying about what i saw'
harris had taken out of his breast pocket a piece of newspaper in which was wrapped the leaf torn out of maule's notebook folded and addressed
he opened it out and laid it on the office table in front of mckeith keeping his own stubby finger on one corner of the sheet
still mckeith maintained his difficult selfrestraint
'so you stolea private communication that had been left in another person's room and was intended for his eyes alone'
'come now boss
you know well enough that a constabulary officer who's up against tricks to release a prisoner has got to keep his eyes peeled and mustn't let any clue to mischief escape him
how was i to know that there wasn't some plot to cheat the law
how do i know that there wasn't
that's why i'm showing you the paper
i'm not a french scholari suppose that's frenchand as i suppose you are i'll ask you to translate what's written there'
mckeith pushed aside the man's finger and taking up the paper carried it to the window where he stood with his back to harris spelling out lady bridget's hurriedly written sentences
he seemed a long time in getting at the sense of what he read
as a matter of fact he had only a limited acquaintance with any modern languages except his own
he had picked up some colloquial german and once when laid up in hospital had set himself to read balzac's pere goriot with the aid of a dictionary
thus he had acquired a fairly extensive if somewhat archaic vocabulary
but lady bridget's veiled intimation of wombo's escape couched in uptodate and highly idiomatic french which would have been perfectly intelligible to willoughby maule conveyed little to him beyond the fact of a secret understanding between his wife and a man whom he knew had once been her lover
that idea drove every other into the background of his thoughts
he did not care in the least how wombo had escaped
it seemed clear to him that oola had stolen the key after harris had gone back to his room while maule and his wife were togethertogether in lady bridget's own chamber
the blood surged to his brain and his temples throbbed as though they would burst
in the madness of his jealousy the words of the paper combined with harris' revelations were damnatory confirmation of his wife's guilt
he felt now that he had foreseen what would happen from the moment that he had surprised the look on lady bridget's face when maule had unexpectedly appeared before her
she had given herself away then
and a little sooner rather than a little lateras might have been the case had he not left them togetherthe inevitable had come to pass
yes through the agony of that conviction now brought home to him a dogged resolve formed itself in his mindthe determination not to betray himself or her
it beat upon him with insistent force
though his goddess must be dethroned from her shrine in his heart she should not be cast down for a vulgar brute like harris to gloat over her shame  'well boss' the police inspector asked with affected nonchalance that bordered on insolence
'can you make anything that's satisfactory to you out of that'
mckeith turned harris thought he was going to leap upon him in a fit of blind fury and started up from his seat by the office table
mckeith's eyes blazed his taut sinews quivered his face was now quite pallid and the hand in which he held the piece of paper was clenched so tight that the veins stood out like thick cords and the knuckles were perfectly bloodless
but suddenly the pitch on his nerves was eased
his eyelids dropped and when he lifted them the eyes were quiet and intently observant
he moved into his usual office chair
'sit down again won't you harris'
he said and harris resumed his former place
'what were you asking'
mckeith continued
'satisfactory to me is it
yes perfectly satisfactory thank you
i'm only amusedas you see to find that i was quite right in my suspicions'
and he laughed in what harris thought a very odd way
'eh
i don't take your meaning'
harris' manner was distinctly objectionable
mckeith gave him a sharp look and his teeth went over his under lip
then to the man's evident surprise he laughed again throwing his head back so that the muscles of his throat showed under his beard working as it were automatically
it really seemed as if the man's mechanical merriment were no part of himself
he was in fact gaining time to propound an explanation which he did not believe in the least but which happened to be almost the exact truth
he answered with an air of ironic indifference
'well you know i wouldn't go in for the detective line if i were you harris
you aren't subtle enough for it
you jump too quickly at conclusions which have nothing to do with the main point
in fact you're a fool harrisa damned fool'
harris' puzzled expression turned to one of extreme indignation
'seems to me mr mckeith that it's you who arewell damned queer about this affair
i'm sure i don't know what you've got to laugh at
but if you've found out who let the blackboy out of the hidehouse i'd be glad to know that's all'
mckeith ceased from his mirthless laughing and his sarcastic bluff
he leaned forward facing harris with his hands on the paper which he had laid on the table before him
he picked up the other's last words
'yes that is all
it's the only part of this note which concerns you
well i can tell you that it was the halfcaste woman as i thought who let wombo out of the hidehouse
she stole the key from mr maule's room when he was asleep and let wombo out when you were asleepa longer time perhaps than you imagined harris
the blackboy made for the scrub and i suppose they were in too great a hurry to think of shutting the door
oola sneaked backthey've got the cunning of whites and blacks put together those halfcastesand no doubt she guessed there'd be a hue and cry directly the door was found open
so she locked it againand brought the key to her ladyship'
mckeith seemed to force the last words from between his teeth
'well that's quite simple isn't it'
'now i shouldn't call it as simple as you make out boss
it appears mighty odd to me that the gin should have worried round after her ladyship when she might have sneaked back with the key to the place she took it from
and then there's all the restthe putting the key back and fitting in times and all that
seems to me a bit too much of the box and cox tricka sort of jigsaw puzzle d'you see'
manifestly harris was endeavouring to square probabilities
mckeith still held himself in
'i've given you the facts
you can figure out your details for yourself
i've my own business to attend to and i must be off on it'
he got up and folding lady bridget's note deliberately put it in his breast pocket
harris stretched forth a restraining hand
'boss i saythat's importantfor my report you know'
mckeith's temper burst out
'damn your report
i'm a magistrate and i've taken your report and the blacks are in the scrub and you can go and find them for yourself if you choose
you have no warrant remember
no i'm not going to be bothered any more about that blackboy
what not iwith a fire raging on my run and not enough hands to put it out'
'but her ladyship' spluttered harris
'listen here you' mckeith's face and attitude were menacing
'i came back to find her ladyship down with dengue as bad as could be
it was on her that night and if she had to be carried to her room in a fit of shaking what business is that of yours
understand me harris
don't you go mixing up my wife's name with this beastly blackboy affair or you'll have to reckon with meand i can tell you you won't relish that reckoning'
'there was no offence meant
i only wanted to do my duty' protested the police inspector cringing after the way of bullies
'you'll find opportunity enough for doing that if you ride back to breeza downs and lend the specials your valuable assistance in protecting the sheepowners against the unionists
and i might remind you as i reminded that damned organiser who's fired my run that there's a hundred pounds reward still waiting for anybody who catches the men that robbed my drays and killed my horses'
mckeith paused a moment before going out by the further door of the office which looked out on the plain
'i'll leave you now to run up your horse and make your own arrangements
as soon as i can i shall start to help in getting the bush fire under
you can arrest that organiser if you are keen on arresting somebody
send in when you're saddled up and if i'm ready we'll ride to the turnoff track together'
mckeith went back to his wife's room
she was still sleeping
then it was that spasms of mortal agony began literally to rend the man
he left her side and seated himself on the bed in his dressingroom
he sat with his arms folded across his chest
his shoulders heaved
deep dry sobs shook his huge frame
he would not let a groan escape from between his clenched teeth but there was blood on his lower lip where he had bitten it in the effort to control himself
presently he heard a sound in the next rooma half moana name spoken
no it would not be his name that she would utter first on her return to consciousness
the man got up stretched his long lean frame shuddering as if it had been on the rack
he drew two deep breaths braced himself wiped the blood from his lip put on the stony mask which bridget saw when she opened her eyes and found him looking down at her
chapter    next morning lady bridget was better and her mind clearer
there had been no return of fever and though the physical weakness was great and her temperaturehad she taken itwould have been found a good deal below normal her fierce determination not to remain helpless any longer gave her strength to get up and dress
she was not able however to do anything but lie in a halfalive condition in the hammock at the end of the veranda
all night the fire had blazed but more fitfully and this morning the lurid glare had died down
only a murky haze faintly red here and there spread over the northeastern sky
small isolated smokeclouds rose above the stretches of forest and an irregularshaped tract of charred grass at the edge of the plain showed how far the flames had encroached upon it before they had been got under
one might well conceive with what almost superhuman exertions the beaters had at length accomplished their task
a large number of cattle had been driven by the fire on to the pasture beyond the home paddocka pasture that had so far been carefully nursed in view of possible later necessity
bridget was bushwoman enough to comprehend the crippling effect upon mckeith's resources of the calamity had she allowed her mind to dwell upon that aspect of affairs
but her mind was incapable just now of dealing with practical issues
she felt utterly weak utterly lonely
although she was glad maule had gone she missed his sympathetic companionship to an extent that she could hardly have thought possible
as the hammock swayed gently at the slight touch of her fingers on its rope edge her imagination drifted dangerously and her senses yielded to the old drugging fascination
he seemed as close to her as had been his bodily shape a few days previously
she was conscious of the pull of his will upon the invisible cords by which he held her
if it were an unholy spell it was now at least in her desolation a consoling one
he loved her he wanted her
she knew that he was passionately eager to devote his life to her
he would wait expectantly until she wrote
with a few strokes of her pen she might end her irksome captivity in this wallless prison of desert plainthis wilderness of gum and gidia
as she lay there in the hammock a child's clumpy boots pattered along the garden path and tommy hensor came up the steps with a big cabbage leaf gathered in his hand
he opened it out when he reached the veranda and displayed three brazilian cherries the first fruits of a plant growing in the chinaman's garden
'laship  laship
i got these myself
i made fo wung give 'em me for you'
at any other time the child's offering would have been received at any rate graciously
now tommy shrank away startled by the look on lady bridget's face and the forbidding gesture with which she warned him off
'go away
 go away
' she cried
'i don't want you'
tommy's common freckled little face crumpled up and his blue eyes filled with tears
he dropped the cabbage leaf and the cherished brazilian cherries and ran down the steps again blubbering piteously
lady bridget got up as soon as the child had clicked the garden gate behind him
she was ashamed of the spasm of revulsion that had seized her
she wanted to cast away from her the dreadful thought his appearance had suddenly evoked
she picked up the cabbage leaf with the fruit and flung them over the railings into a flower bed where the butcherbirds and the bowerbirds quarrelled over them and the big grey bird in the gum tree on the other side of the fence cachinnated in derisive chorus to bridget's burst of hysterical laughter
a little later maggie came out from the bedroom with some letters in her hand
'i've laid holt on your mail ladyship turning out your room
i expect you forgot all about it'
yes she had forgotten absolutely it seemed years since harry the blower had passed by and willoughby maule had departed
she languidly inspected the envelopes
nothing among them of any importanceexcept one
it was a blue telegraphservice envelope and had been forwarded on by the postman from crocodile creek the nearest telegraph station
in the last fifteen months they had brought the bush railway a good deal further up the river and crocodile creek was the present terminus
thus the road journey was now considerable shorter than when colin mckeith had brought his bride home
lady bridget read the several lines of the cabled message over two or three times before the real bearings of it became clear to her feverweakened intelligence
at last she grasped the startling fact that the cablegram was from her cousin lord gaverick and that it had been despatched from london about seven days previously
this was what it said
'eliza gaverick died twentieth leaves you castle and fifty thousand difficulties executors your presence urgently desired wire if can come gaverick'  lady bridget let the blue form drop on her lap
she stared out over the brown plain and the herds of lean beasts all shadowy in the smoky mist over the horizon then round along the wilderness of gidia scrub with its charred patches afar off from which there still rose thin spirals of smoke
destiny had spoken
here was the order of release
there was no gaoler to keep the prison doors locked any longerexceptexceptno if she wished to break her bonds colin would never gainsay her
late that night the men came back from fighting the fire which they had now practically put out
even in the moonlight they looked deplorable objects grimed covered with dust and ashes their skins and clothes scorched by the fierce heat
they seemed drunk with fatigue and could scarcely sit their horses
when they dismounted they could hardly stand
their feeble cooees at the sliprails brought out ninnis who had been sent home in the afternoon and had been taking some wellearned repose so as to be ready for the next shifthappily not required
he and the few hands left to look after the headstation and the tailingmob held the men's horses when their riders literally tumbled off them
ninnis made mckeith take a strong pull of whiskey and supported him along to the old humpey
for colin had had strength to say that lady bridget must on no account be disturbed
ninnis led him to the room lately occupied by willoughby maule and was surprised at his employer's vehement refusal to remain in it
'i'll not stop here no i won't go to my dressingroom
in god's name just let me stretch myself on the bunk in the office and go to sleep'
he threw himself on a bushcarpentered settle with mattress and pillows covered in turkeyred which was used sometimes at mustering times when there was an overplus of visitors
there he lay like a log for close on twelve hours
by and by lady bridget at once longing and reluctant came softly in to see how he fared
a storm of pity anger tenderness repulsionthe whole range of feeling it seemed between love and hateswept over her as she looked at the great gaunt form stretched there
colin was still in riding clothes and booted and spurred
his moleskins were black with smoke and charcoal his flannel shirt open at the neck showed red scratches and scorchmarks on the exposed chest and was torn over the arms where were more excoriations of the flesh
and the ravaged face
how hard it was
how relentless even in the utter abandonment of bodily exhaustion
the skin was caked with black dust and sweat
the darkened thatch of yellow hair was dank and wet
the fair beard usually so trim was singed in places matted and had bits of cinder and burnt leaves sticking to it
a revolting spectacle offending lady bridget's fine physical sensibilities but a manthe man
she could not understand that tornado of emotion which now made her being seem a very battleground for all the primal passions
she turned away with a sense of nausea and then turned to him again with a kind of passionate longing to take him in her armsbrutal as she thought him and unworthy of the affection she had once felt for himfelt still alasand all the romance she had once woven about him she saw that a fly was hovering over the excoriated arm and drew the ragged sleeve over its bareness
then she noticed the mosquito net reefed up on a hoop above the bunk and managed to get the curtain down so that he should be protected from the assaults of insects
but as she touched him in doing this he stirred and muttered wrathfully in his sleep as though he were conscious of her tenderness and would have none of it she fled away and came to him no more
she had been racking her brain since receiving the cablegram as to what answer she should return to it
after that pitiable sight of her husband bridget moved restlessly about the house with intervals of lassitude in the hammock for she still felt weak and ill
but quinine was keeping the fever down and she resolved that her husband should not again be required to nurse her
she did not go into the office any more but busied herself in a defiant fashion upon little cares for his comfort when he awoke
he should see that she did not neglect her housewifely dutiesat least while she remained there to perform them
the qualification was significant of her mood
thus she gave orders that the veranda of the old humpey should be kept free from disturbing footsteps and saw that the bathroom was in order and a change of clothing set ready for him when he should awake
also that there should be a meal prepared
he did not wake till the afternoon
she heard him go straight in to take his bath and hastened to have the dining room table spread
but she saw him go out of the bathroomall fresh and more like himselfand cross the yard on his way to the bachelors' quarters making it clear to her that he wished to avoid the part of the house she occupied
bridget went back to the front veranda in a cold fury pierced by stabs of mental pain
she watched him from the end of the veranda go into the living room of the quarters and thought bitterly that he would ask mrs hensor for the food he required
no doubt too he would obtain from mrs hensor information as to how she herself had been getting on during his absence and mrs hensor would give him a garbled report of her own dismissal from the sick room how dared heoh
how dared he treat her lady bridget his wife with such cruel negligence such marked insult
it did not occur to her that he might wish to see ninnis who when at the station was usually about this time in his office at the back of the bachelors' quarters
after a time she heard colin's voice again in the yard and his step on the old humpey veranda
he came now by the covered passage on to that of the new house and advanced towards her
he only came she told herself because it would have seemed too strange had he continued to ignore her existence
and he was conscious of her resentment
by a curious affinity his own spirit thrilled to the unquenchable spirit in her
qualities in himself responded to like qualities in her
he admired her pride and pluck
yet the two egoisms reared against each other seemed to himcould he have put the thought into shapelike combatants with lances drawn ready to strike
he believed that it was love which gave her strengthlove not for him but for that other man whose influence he was now convinced had always been paramount and who with renewed propinquity had resumed his domination
certain phrases in that letter he had read long ago on joan gildea's veranda and which had been haunting him ever since willoughby maule's reappearance struck his heart with the searing effect of lightning
he felt at the first sight of her there on the veranda before she turned full to him a passionate yearning to take her in his arms and cover her poor little wasted face with kissesto call her 'mate' to remind her of that wonderful marriage night under the stars
but when he saw the proud aloofness of her look his longing changed to a dull fury which he could only keep in check by rigorous steeling of his will against any softening impulse
so his face was hard as a rock his voice rasping in its restraint when he came near and spoke to her
'you have not had any more fever'
'no'
he put two or three questions to her about her healthwhether she had taken the medicine he had left for her and so on to which she returned almost monosyllabic replies sufficiently satisfactory in the information they gave him
'that's all right then' he said coldly
'i thought it would be though i didn't at all like leaving you in such a condition'
'really
but it doesn't seem as if you had felt any violent anxiety about me since you came back
i heard you go to the bathroom a long time ago and i saw you going up to the quarters'
he did not appear to notice the latter implication
'i had to sleep' he said curtly
'i was dead beat'
'yes i saw that' she answered
'aah'
the deep intake of breath made a hissing sound and he flushed a brick red
'you came and looked at me'
'i went into the office'
'i didn't want you to see me
you must have loathed the sight of me
i was a disgusting object'
she said nothing
if he had glanced at her he would have seen a piteous flicker of tenderness pass over her facea sudden wet gleam in her eyes
and had he yielded then to his first impulse things might have gone very differently between them
but he kept himself stiffened
he would not lift his eyes when she gave him a furtive glance
the expression of his half averted face was positively sinister as he added with a sneering little laugh
'one can't look as if one had come out of a bandbox after fighting a bush fire'
she exclaimed 'oh
what does it matter'
he utterly mistook the meaning of her exclamation
'you are quite right' he retorted
'when it comes to the end of everything what does anything matter'
for several moments there was dead silence
she felt as if he had wilfully stabbed her
he on his side had again the confused sense of two antagonists feinting with their weapons to gain time before the critical encounter
'well'
he swung himself savagely round upon her
'that's true isn't it
the end has come you're sick of the whole showdead sickof the bushof everythingaren't you
answer me straight bridget'
'yes i am' she replied recklessly
'i hate the bushii hate everything'
'everything
well that settles it'
he said slowly
again there was silence and then he said  'you know i wouldn't want to keep youespecially now'he did not add the words that were on his lips 'now that bad times are coming on me'and she read a different application in the 'now'
'ii'd be glad for you to quit
it's as you pleasemaybe the sooner the better
i'll make everything as easy as i can for you'
'you are veryconsiderate' the sarcasm broke in her throat
she moved abruptly and stood gazing out over the plain till the hysterical choking sensation left her
her back was to him
he could not see her face nor could she see the dumb agony in his
presently she walked to a shelftable on the veranda set against the wall and from the litter of papers and work upon it took up the cablegram she had lately received
'i wanted to show you this' she said stonily and handed him the blue paper
there was something significant in the way he steadied it upon the veranda railing and stooped with his head down to pore over it
the blow was at first almost staggering
it was as though the high gods had shot down a bolt from heaven shattering his world and leaving him alone in chaos
they had taken him at his wordhad registered on the instant his impious declaration
it was the end of everything
she was to quit
he had said the sooner the better wellhe wasn't going to let even the high gods get a rise out of him
he laughed
by one of those strange links of association which at moments of unexpected crisis bring back things impersonal unconnected the sound of his own laugh recalled the rattle of earth upon the dry outside of a sheet of bark in which during one of their boundary rides at breeza downs lately they had wrapped for burial the body of a shepherd found dead in the bush
both sounds seemed to him as of something deadsomething outside humanity
he handed her back the telegram speaking still as if he were faroffon the other side of a grave but quite collectedly and as though in the long silence he had been weighing the question
'it seems to me that this has come to you in the nick of time to solve difficulties'
'yes' she assented dully
'you've got no choice but to go as your cousin says
there's money depending on it'
'money
 oh money'
she cried wildly
'money is apt to stick on to lawyers' fingers when they're left to the handling of it 
this is a matter of business and business can't be put on one sideespecially when there's as large a sum as fifty thousand pounds in the proposition
i guess from this that you're wanted'
'yes' she said again
she was thinking to herself 'that's his scotch carefulness about money he wouldn't consider anything in comparison with that'
'you had better take the northern route' he went on
'there ought to be an e and a boat due at leuraville pretty sooni'll look it out
 perhaps you'd like to make the start tomorrow'
'tomorrowoh yes tomorrowjust whenever suits you'
'i couldn't take you down myself
there are thingsserious matters i've got to see to on the station
and besides you'll allow it's best for me not to go with you
ninnis could drive you to crocodile creek and put you into the train and halliwell will look after you at leuraville and see you on board the steamer'
'oh i wonder that you can spare ninnis' she returned bitterly
'i suppose you'd want moongarr bill still more on the run
but there's joe caseyi daresay somebody else can milk the cows and get up wood and water
or there's cudgeei don't mind who goes with me
i can drive myself'
'my god
do you imagine i'd put a blackboyor anyone but my own trusted overseer in charge of you
what are you thinking of to talk like that'
he took a few steps along the veranda moving with uncertain gait then stopped and leaned heavily against the wall
in a few seconds he had recovered himself and came back to her speaking quietly
'i will think out things and arrange it all
you'll be perfectly safe with ninnis i think it would be better for you to sleep one night at old duppo's place
there's fresh horses for the buggy therei've got alexander and roxalana in the paddock nowthey're the best'  oh how could he bear that those horses of the dreamdrive should take her away from him
he went on in the same matteroffact manner
'i expect the answer to the cablegram will get as quickly as if harry the blower took it if you send it from crocodile creek yourself
and there's your packingthere's not much time but you won't want to take a lot of things
anything you cared about could go afterwards'
'go afterwardswhat do you mean
i want to take nothingnothing except a few clothes'
'ah wellit doesn't matteras you saidnothing matters now well i'll go and see ninnis and settle about tomorrow then there's money' he stopped at the edge of the steps leading down to the old humpey looking back at her'what you'll need for the passageand afterwardsi know what you'll be thinking but i can arrange for it with the bank manager at leuraville'
a mocking demon rose in her
'please don't let yourself be inconvenienced
i only want the bare passage money
and directly i get to england i will pay you back'
his hands dropped to his sides as if she had shot him
his face was terrible
at that moment she could have bitten her tongue out
'i don't thinkyou need have said that bridget' and he went slowly down the steps and out of her sight like a man who has received a mortal hurt
chapter    if purgatory could hold worse torture than life held on that last evening lady bridget spent at moongarr then neither she nor her husband would have been required to do any long expiation there
it would be difficult to say which of the two suffered the most
probably mckeith because he was the strongest
equally he showed it the least when the breaking moment had passed
yet both husband and wife seemed to have covered their faces hearts and souls with unrevealing masks
no it was worse than that
each was entirely aware of the mental and spiritual barrier which made it absolutely impossible for them to approach each other in the sense of reality
a barrier infinitely more forbidding than any material one of stone or iron
because it was living poisoned venomous as the fang of some monstrous deadly serpent
to come within its influence meant the death of love
there was not much more of the day to get through
husband and wife both got through it in a fever of activity over details that seemed scarcely to matter
he busied himself with ninnisfirst explaining to the overseer as briefly as he could the necessity for lady bridget's voyage to englanda necessity that appealed to ninnis' practical mind particularly in the present financial emergency
it surprised him a little that mckeith should not himself see his wife off but he also recognised practical reasonsagainst that natural concession to sentiment
on the whole it rather pleased him to find his employer ignoring sentiment and he fully appreciated the confidence reposed in himself
the two men went over questions connected with the journey overhauling the buggy so that springs bars and bolts might be in order seeing that the horses were in good condition sending on cudgee that very hour with a second pair in relay for the long stage of the morrow when over fifty miles must be covered
there would be another pair at old duppo's and after a day and night of comparative rest alexander and roxalana would be fresh for the last long stage of the journey
they calculated that under these provisions the railway terminus at crocodile creek might be reached on the eve of the third day
and there were many instructions and much careful arranging for lady bridget's comfort during the journey
then there were letters to write business calculations a further overdraft to be applied for to the bank pending the cattle sales would there be saleable cattle enough to meet demands and expenses of sinking fresh artesian boresnow that the fire had destroyed all the best grass on the run
mckeith found no consolation in the prospect of his wife's riches
that only added gall to his bitterness new fuel to his stubborn pride new strength to the wall between them
he sat brooding in his office when the business letters were writtento the bankmanager to captain halliwell the policemagistrate at leuraville to the manager of the eastern and australian steam navigation depot leuraville enclosing a draft to pay the passage to the captain of the boat advertised for that trip who happened to be an acquaintance of hisall recommending lady bridget to the different people's careall anticipating and arranging against every possible drawback to her comfort on the voyageall carefully stating the object of her trip to englandbusiness connected with the death of a near relative
then after the ghastly pretence of dinnerduring which appearances were kept up unnecessarily before maggie and the malay boy by a forced discussion of matteroffact detailslooking out the exact time of the putting in of the next e and a boat at leuravilleall of which he had already done and pointing out to bridget that she could catch it with a day to spare
there was food for the journey too to be thought of and other things to talk about
as soon as the meal was ended mckeith went back to the office and bridget saw or heard no more of him that night
he did not come even to his dressingroom
she concluded that he was 'camping' on the bunk in the office and when her own packing was done she lay in wakeful misery till dawn brought a troubled doze
her packing was no great businessclothes for the voyage and a big furred cloak for warmth when she should arrive in england in the depth of winterthat was all
everything elseher papers knicknacks personal belongingsshe left just as they were
colin might do as he liked about them
she felt reckless and quite hard
only one among those personal possessions moved her to despairing tears
it was a shrivelled section of bark chopped from a gum tree warped almost into a tube
she placed this carefully in the deepest drawer of her wardrobe
would colin ever find it thereand would he understand
all the time through these preparations strangely enough she did not think of any possible future in connection with willoughby maule
the events of the past few days seemed to have driven him outside her immediate horizon
when she came out in the morning dressed for her journey she found her husband in the veranda waiting to strap up and carry out her baggage
scarcely a word passed between them they did not even breakfast together
he said he had been up early and had had his breakfast already but he watched her trying to eat while he moved about collecting things for her journey and he poured out the coffee and begged her to drink it
while he was there chen sing brought in the basket of food he must have ordered for the buggy and there was fo wung too the gardener with fresh lettuce and watercress and a supply of cool green cabbage leaves in which he had packed a few early flatstone peaches and some brazilian cherries
lady bridget thanked them with the ghost of her old sweetness and they promised to have the garden 'velly goodtai yat number one' and to 'make plenty nice dishes' for the boss during her absence
while they stood at the french window mckeith filled flasks with wine and spirits and packed quinine and different medicines he had prepared in case of her needing them
then after shewing her the different bottles he took the supply out to ninnis to be put in the buggy
everything was ready nowthe buggy packed the hood unslung so that it could be put up and down in protection against sun or rainthis last alas
an improbable eventuality
alexander and roxalana were champing their bits
ninnis in a new cabbagetree hat and clean puggaree wearing the light coat he only put on when in the society of ladies he wished to honour was standing by the front wheels examining the lash of his drivingwhip
mckeith had given him his last directions
there was nothing now to wait for
mckeith went slowly up the steps of the back veranda and in at the french window of the sitting room where bridget had been watching waiting
at his appearance she went back into the room
she stood quite still small shadowy the little bit of her face which showed between the folds of her motor veil where it was tied down under her chinvery pale and the eyes within their red narrowed lids dry and bright
'are you ready bridget'
he asked
'yes'
he came close and took a little bag she was holding out of her hands carried it to the back veranda and told one of the chinamen to give it to mr ninnisall it seemed to her to evade farewells
she called him back in a hard voice
'colini've left my keys'pointing to a sealed and addressed envelope on her own writingtable
'there are a few things of valuesome you have given mein the drawers'
'i will take care of them' he answered hoarsely
they stood fronting each other and their eyes both smarting agonised stared at each other out of the pale drawn faces
'colin' she said and held out her hands
'aren't you going to say goodbye'
he took her hands his burning look met hers for an instant and dropped
there was always the poisonous wall which their soul's vision might not piercethrough which their yearning lips might not touch
for an instant too the hardness of his face was broken by a spasm of emotion
the grip of his hands on hers was like that of a steel vice she winced at the pain of it
he dropped her hands suddenly and moved back a step
'goodbyebridget'
'is that all you have to say
all'
he stuttered helplessly
'iican't
there's nothing to say'
'nothing
you let me golike thiswithout one word of apologyof regret
i think that at least you owe mecourtesy'
her tone lashed him
he seemed to be struggling with his tonguetied speech
when words came they rushed out in fierce jerks
'i'll say thisthough where's the good of talking what does it amount to anyway when you're down on the bedrock and there's nothing left but to give up the whole show and start fresh as best you can
i'll say thisi've never pretended to fine mannersi leave themto others
i'm just a rough bushman no better and no worse
apologythat's my apologyas for regret
my god
isn't it all one huge regret
no i won't say that because there are some things i can't regretfor myself
for you i do regret them
i was an insane ass ever to imagine that i and my way of living could ever fit in with a woman brought up like you
the incompatibilities were bound to come outincompatibilities of temper education breedingoutlook on thingsthey were bound to separate us sooner or later i'm glad that it's sooner because that gives you a chance of getting back into your old conditions before you've grown different in yourselfdried upsouredmaybe lost your health roughing it through bad times in the bush as it is you'll get out all rightnever fear that i won't see you get out all right'
'and you'
she put in
'me
i don't counti don't care a man's not like a woman
i've always been a fighter
and i've never been downed in my life
i'm not going to be downed this time
i shall make goodsome timesomehow
i'm not the sort of small potato that drops to the bottom of the bag in the big shakeup'
she winced visibly
he read distaste in her slight gesture in the expression of her eyes
it was true that the man's pugnacious egoisma lower side of him asserting itself just thenhad always jarred upon her finer taste
he recognised this subconsciously and his selfesteem revolted at it
'you needn't be afraid' he exclaimed harshly
'if i wanted to hold to my rights and keep you here with mewhat has happened would prevent mei've got too much pride to hang on to the skirts of a rich wife
but you won't be harmed
i don't know yet but i believe there's a way by which you can win through straight and squareno smirch that you need mindand if there iswhatever the way of it is i'll do my best to bring you out all right'
'you are generous'
her eyes flashed but her voice was coldly bitter
'may i ask what you propose to do'
'there's no use' he said heavily
'i told you talking was no goodnow
i've got my own ideas'  'then if that's how you feel the sooner i go the better pleased you will be' she returned hysterically
'oh i'm ready to go'
he moved to the steps not answering at once
then he said  'the buggy is waiting will you come'
he went down the steps in front of her but stopped at the bottom to help her for her foot had stumbled on the edge of the veranda
his strong arm upheld her until she was on the gravel
the touch of his fingers on her arm brought home the incredible horror of it allthe suddenness the brutality
she pulled her veil hastily over her face to hide the gush of tears
she could not speak for the choking lump in her throat
he released her at once and strode on
not another word passed between them
ninnis greeted her with gruff cordialitybegan a sort of speech about the cause of her departurecondolence and congratulations stupidly mixed
mckeith impatiently cut him short
'all right ninnis
get up
and mind the horses are fresh
they'll want a bit of driving at the start'
he helped bridget to her seat tucked the brown linen coverlet round her knees
in doing so he bent his headshe thought he had dropped something
then through the thin linen of the covering and her light summer garments she felt the pressure of his burning lips as though they were touching her flesh
she bent forward
their eyes met in a wild look just for a second
the horses plunged under ninnis' hands on the reins
mckeith sprang back
'wooh
gee on then'
ninnis called out
'goodbye boss
you can trust me to look well after her ladyship be back again as soon as i can'
and if colin spoke the sound did not carry to his wife's ears
her last impression of him as the buggy swayed and rattled down the hill was again the dogged droop of his great shoulders
it was too late now
she felt that the furies were pursuing her
ah but the end had comecome with such hideous misconceptionevery word spokenand there had been so few in comparison with the immensity of the occasiona hopeless blunder
it had been the tussle of two opposing temperaments it was like the rasping steel of a crosscut saw against the hard heavy grain of an ironbark gum log
then the extraordinary involvements of circumstance
each incident big and little dovetailing and hastening the onward sweep of catastrophe
it seemed as though fate had cunningly engineered the forces on every plane so that there should be no escape for her victims
like almost all the tragedies of ordinary human life this one had been too swift in its action to allow of suitable dialogue or setting
chapter    from joan gildea to colin mckeith
written about a year later
my dear colin  i find it impossible to recognise my old friend in the hard businesslike communication you sent me from leichardt's town
i almost wish that you had allowed the lawyer you consulted to put the case before me instead it would have seemed less unfitting and i could have answered it better
but i quite appreciate your objection to taking the lawyer into your confidence as regards the personal matters you mention to me
it would be cruelly unjusti think quite unpardonable in you to bring forward the name of mr willoughby maule in connection with bridget
not that he would mind that
i honestly believe that he would snatch gladly at any means for inducing bridget to marry him
whether she would do so if you were to carry through this amazing scheme of yours it's impossible for me to say
at present she certainly prefers to keep him at a distance
he has never been to castle gaverick
and except for a few visits on business to london that is where she has lived since she came over here
your letter followed me to jamaica where i've been reporting on the usual lines for the imperialist but of course i couldn't answer it until i had talked it over with bridget and as you desired had obtained her views on the matter
it was a shock to her to realise that your reason for never writing to her and for refusing to let her write to you was lest that might affect the legality of these proceedings which i understand you have contemplated from the beginning of your quarrel
bridget is too proud to show you how deeply she is wounded by your letter
all she has to say is that if you really wish to take this action she will not oppose it
but colin do you really wish it
i refuse to believe that you seriously contemplate divorcing your wife
you must know that you have not the accepted grounds for doing so
as for the law you quote which allows divorce in cases of two years' socalled desertion i can only say that i consider it a blot on leichardt's land legislation
divorce should be for one cause onlythe cause to which our lord gave a qualified approval and bridget has never been unfaithfulin act or desire to her husband
i would maintain this in spite of the most damning testimony and you must in your heart believe it also
besides your testimony is ridiculously inadequate
i am glad however that you have at last made your accusations in detailin order as you saythat iand bridget incidentally i supposeshould fully understand why you are adopting this attitude towards her
i'm glad too that you do not mean to make any use of the evidence against her and are prepared to take all the blame for the unhappy state of affairs between you
i write sarcastically
why it would be monstrous if you had any other intention
oh how i hate this pedantic roundabout way of writing
i feel inclined to tear up these sheetsi've torn up two already
really you've made it so difficult for me to treat you naturally
if i could talk to you i'd make you understand in five minutesbut i can'tso there
naturally i had heard of your bringing mr willoughby maule to the station and when i learned what followed naturally also i concluded that you had discovered his identity with that of the man bridget had once cared for
i blame myself horribly
but for my carelessness you would never have read that letter of biddy'sshe knows all about it nowand your insane jealousy would not have jumped to conclusionsat any rate so quickly
and perhaps if i had not bound you to secrecy you'd have had the matter out with her which would probably have saved all this trouble
anyhow i can't imagine that you would have left her alone with him as you didand with bad feeling between youat the mercy of her own reckless impulses and that of willoughby maule's ardent lovemaking
she doesn't pretend that it wasn't ardent or that he did not do his best to get her to run away with himor that the old infatuation did not come back to a slight extentis it surprising after your conduct
no wonder she compared his devotion favourably with yours
colin your leaving her in such conditions wasn't the act of a man of a gentleman
i speak strongly but i can't help it
i know your stubborn pride and obstinacy but you were wrong you have disappointed meoh
how bitterly you have disappointed me
then there was that business about the blacks
what a fool you wereand how brutally selfopinionated
i don't wonder bridget thought you an inhuman monster
now i have said my worst and you must take it as it is meant and forgive me
as for the true story of that night's adventures out of which your police inspector seems to have made such abominable capitali used to think police inspectors were generally gentlemenbut they don't seem to be out on the leurai've got all the details from biddy
a tragicomic businessso truly of the bush bushy
i could laugh over it if it weren't for its serious consequences
of course biddy got up to turn out the goats which were butting with their horns under the floor of her bedroom
i've often got up myself in the old days at bungroopim when stray calves got into the garden or the cockatoo disturbed our slumbers
do you remember polly
and how she would keep shouting out on a moonlight night 'the top of the mornin' to ye'because we'd forgotten to put her blanket over the cagei believe there were several occasions when you and i met in midnight dishabille and helped each other to restore tranquillity
if anyone was to blame for biddy's adventure it was your woodandwater joeyor your chinamenor whoever's business it may have been to see that the goats were properly penned
naturally mr maule when he was disturbed too came and did the turning out for bridget and shepherded the creatures to the fold
then meanwhile she saw the blackgin sneaking in at mr maule's back window to steal the key and would it have been philanthropic impulsive biddy if she hadn't helped in the work of rescue and sent the two sinners with a 'bless you my children'
off into the scrub
it was like biddy too to go and put the key back in mr maule's bedroom and to scribble that ridiculous note in french so that he shouldn't go blundering to the hidehouse and hurry up the pursuit
i told bridget how the inspector had watched her go out of mr maule's room and had grabbed the note afterwards and shown it to you
she had forgotten altogether about that notesupposed that of course it had reached its proper destination
she couldn't remember either exactly what she had writtenexcept that she wanted to word it so that if there should be any accident nobodyexcept mr maule for of course they'd determined on the release before thatshould understand to what it referred
so she didn't mention any nameshe believes she dashed off some words he had quoted to her about love triumphant and securing happiness and freedom by flight
and then she put in something referring to a scene they'd had that day in which he had begged her to fly with him and she had made him promise to leave next morning pacifying him by a counter promise to write
she told me about her fever and agueyou don't need proof of that after the state in which you found herand how mr maule carried her to her room and left her there after a few minutes
she doesn't remember anything after that until she came out of the fever and saw youwith the face and manner i can well imaginestanding by her bedside
i am sure that bridget began to 'find herself' then and that the way in which she left moongarr was one of those shocks which make a woman touch reality
it may be only for that once in her life but she can never be the same again
you have put your brand on your wife colinthat is quite plain to me
she has changed inwardly more than outwardly
but she is extremely reticent about her feelings towards you
that in itself is so unlike the old bridget and i have no right to put forward my own ideas and opinionsthey may be quite wrong
really the news of eliza lady gaverick's death and of bridget's change of fortune coming just at that moment is the sort of dramatic happening which ias a dabbler in fictionmaintain is more common in real life than in novels
i am certain that if i had set out to build up the tangled third act of a problem play on those lines i couldn't have done it better
all the same i'm very sorry that this change of fortune didn't come off earlier or later for i am well aware of how you will jib at it
well i can tell you on her own authority that bridget never wrote to mr maule as she had promised
she had no communication with him from the time he left the station until they met on the e and a boat
he joined her as you know at the next port above leuraville
it was rather canny of him to go thereyet i don't see how in the circumstances he could have loafed round leuraville without making talkthough i think it was a great pity he didn't
of course he had his own means of communication with the township and knew she was on board
no one was more surprised than she at his appearance on deck next morning
i don't think however that she saw much of him on the voyage
she said that she got a recurrence of the malarial fever off the northern coast and had to keep her cabin pretty well till they reached colombo
then she asked him to leave the steamer and take a p and o boat that happened to be in harbourand this he did do
i am bound to say that willoughby maule must have improved greatly since the time when young lady gaverick decided he was a 'bounder'
i daresay marriage did him good
i believe that his wife was a very charming woman
or it may be that the possession of a quarter of a million works a radical change in people's characters
or again it may be that he is more deeply devoted to biddy than i for one ever suspected
there is no doubt that given the regrettable position his behaviour in regard to her now is commendable
but bridget doesn't love himnever has loved him
i state that fact on no authority whatsoever except my own intuition
also i am honestly of opinion she has cared for you more than she has cared for any man
you don't deserve it and i may be wrong
but nevertheless it is my conviction
make of it what you please
i have been i candidly own it surprised to see what discretion and good feeling she has shown through all this gaverick will business
there has been a good deal of disagreeable friction in the matter
lord gaverick has not come off so well as he expected
he has got the house in upper brook street which suits young lady gaverick and about fifteen hundred a yearconsiderably less than bridget
the trouble is that eliza gaverick left a large legacy to her doctorthe latest oneand there was a talk about bringing forward the plea of undue influence
that however has fallen to the groundmainly through biddy's persuasion
i believe it is bridget's intention to make over castle gaverick to her cousin but this is not given out and of course she may change her mind
and now colin i think i have said everything i have to say
the main point to you is no doubt the answer to your question
as i said at the beginning of this letter bridget will not oppose any course you choose to take in order to secure your release from herthat is the exact way she worded it
but i cannot believe that in face of all the rest i have told you you will go on with this desertiondivorce businessat least without making yourself absolutely certain that you both desire to be free of each other
remember there has been no explanation between you and biddyno chance of touch between the true selves of both of you
can you not come to england to see her
or should she go out to you
i think it possible she might consent to do so but have never broached the idea and cannot say
yes of course i understand that this might invalidate the legal position
but as only two years are necessary to prove the desertioneven if you should decide together that it is best to partisn't it worth while to wait two years more in order to make quite sure
no doubt you will say that i am shewing the proverbial ignorance of women in legal questions
but i can't help feeling that there must be some way in which it could be arranged
i do beseech you colin not to act hastily
you say that if this divorce took place bridget's reputation would not suffer and that she could marry again without a stain upon her character as they say of wrongfully accused prisoners who are discharged
but againis that the question
i know nothing of your present circumstanceshealth outlook on lifeanything
bridget once hinted to me that you might have your own reasons for desiring your freedom
she would give no grounds for the suspicion that there is any other woman in your life
i do not think anything would make me credit such a thing and i put that notion entirely out of court
i do not knowas your letter was dated from leichardt's townwhether you still live at moongarr
it is possible you may have sold the place
i hear of severe droughts in parts of leichardt's land but have no information about the leura district
now that sir luke tallant has exchanged to hong kong bridget hasn't any touch with leichardt's land and i have very few correspondents there
write to menot a stilted legal kind of letter like the last
tell me about yourselfyour feelings your conditions
we are old friendsfriends long before bridget came either into my life or yours
you can trust me
if you do not want me to repeat to bridget anything you may tell me i will faithfully observe your wishes
but i can't bear that you whom i should have thought so well ofhave felt so much aboutshould be making a mess of your life and that i should not put out a hand to prevent it
always your friend  joan gildea
chapter    it was a long time before mrs gildea received an answer to her letter
she had begun to despair of ever getting another line from colin mckeith when at last he wrote from moongarr six months later
my dear joan  your letter has made me think
i could not write before for reasons that you'll gather as you go along
i shall do as you ask and tell you everything as straightly and plainly as i can
i feel it is best that you should know exactly the sort of conditions i'm under and what a woman would have had to put up with if she had been with mewhat she would have to put up with if she were going to be with me
then you can judge whether or not i'm right in the decision i have come to as the result of my thinkings
you can tell my wife as much as you pleaseof the details i mean
perhaps you had better soften them to her for you know as well as i door betterthat her impulsive quixotic disposition might lead her into worse mistakes than it has done already
of course she'll have to know my decision
i am sure that if she allows her reason play she will agree it is the only possible one
i'm not going to talk about what happened before she went away or about that evidenceor anything else in that immediate connection
i was mad and i expect i believed a lot more than was true
i don't believei don't think i ever did really believewhat i suppose you would call 'the worst'
but that doesn't seem to me of such great matter
it's the spirit not the letter that counts
the foundation must have been rotten or there never would have been a question of believing one way or the otherbecause we should have understood
explanations would not have been needed between true mates
only we were not true matesthat's the whole point
there was too great a radical difference between us
it might have been a deal better if she had gone off with that man
but to come now to the practical part of the situation
you know enough about australian ups and downs to realise that a cattle or sheep owner out west may be potentially wealthy one season and on the fair road to beggary the next
it will be different when times change and we take to sinking artesian bores on the same principle as when joseph stored up grain in the fat years in egypt against the lean ones that were coming
that's what i meant to do and ought to have done at any cost
butwell i just didn't
the thing is that if i could have looked ahead perhaps even six months i might not have thought it acting on the square to a woman to get her to marry me
if i could have looked a year ahead i wouldn't have had any doubt on the subject
but you see i justified it to myself
one thousand square miles of countryfine grazing land most of it so long as the creeks kept runningand no more than eleven thousand head of stock upon it seemed with decent luck a safe enough proposition though you'll remember i was a bit doubtful that day on your veranda at emu point when we talked about my marrying
the truth was that directly i saw bridget she carried me clean off my headand that's the long and short of it
besides i'd been down south a good while then figuring about in the legislative assembly and swaggering on my prospects
i'd left ninnis to oversee up here and ninnis didn't know the leura like some of the old hands who told me afterwards they'd seen the big drought coming as long back as that
i remember one old chap on the river when he was sold up by the bank in the last bad times and his wife had died of it all saying to me 'the leura isn't the place for a woman'
and he was right
well i saw that i was straight up against it that spring when we had had a poor summer and a dry winter and the unionists started trouble cutting my horses' throats and burning woodsheds and firing the only good grass on my run that i could rely upon
i didn't say much about it but i have no doubt that it made me badtempered and less pleasant to live with that was just before the time biddy went away
afterwards the sales i'd counted on turned out badlycattle too poor for want of grass to stand the droving and the worst luck in the saleyards i'd ever known
first thing i did was to reduce the staff and bar everything but bare necessariesi sent off the chinamen and every spare hand
ninnis and i and the stockmana firstrate chap moongarr billworked the runjust the three of us
you can guess how we managed it
a malay boy did cooky for the headstation
after christmas i left ninnis and bill to look after the place
i had to go to leichardt's town
i had been thinking things out about biddy all that timeyou know i'm too much of the scotchy to make hasty determinations
well i had that parliament bill allowing divorce after two years desertion in my head from the day biddy left me
it seemed the best way outfor her
i had heard about that fellow going home in the same boat with her and never guessed but that it was a concerted plan between them
that note harris showed me made me think it was so
i don't think this nowafter what you told me
but what did rub itself into me then was that i ought to let her marry him as soon as she decently could
i couldn't see the matter any other wayi don't now
he has lots of moneythough a man who would buy happiness with another woman out of the money his wife had left himwell that's a matter of opinion
besides she has got the fortune the old lady left her and can be independent of him if she chooses
there's nothing to prevent her living any kind of life that pleases herexcept me and i'm ready and willing to clear out of the show
one thing i'm sorry for now and that is having torn up the draft she sent to pay me back her passage money and putting the bits in an envelope and posting them to her without a word
i suppose it should have been done through a lawyer with all the proper palaver
perhaps she didn't tell you about that
i somehow fancy she didn't
but i know that it would have hurt heri knew that when i did it
and perhaps that is why i did it
you are right
i haven't acted the part of a gentleman all through this miserable business
but what could you expect
for you see my father worked his own way up and my grandfather was a crofterand i haven't got the blood of irish kings on the other side behind me
now i'm being nasty as you used to say in the old bungroopim days when i wouldn't play
you were my ideal in those days joanbefore you went and got married
i've been an unlucky devil all round
well there
i had to try and arrange things for an overdraft with the bank in leichardt's town but i went down chiefly to consult lawyers about the divorce question so that it should be done with as little publicity and unpleasantness as possible
it appeared that it could be done all rightas i wrote you
what would have been the good of my havering in that letter over my own feelings and the bad times i had struck
it never was my habit to whine over what couldn't be helped
luck was up against me down there too
i got pitched off a buckjumper at a horsedealers' bungroopim way
i had been 'blowing' australian fashion that i could handle that colt if nobody else was able to
the end of it was that the buckjumper got home not me
i was laid up in hospital for close on two months with a broken leg and complications
the complications were that old spear wound which inflamed and they found that a splinter from the jagged tip had been left in
bloodpoisoning was the next thing and when i came out of that hospital i was more like the used up bit of soap you'll see by the coolibah outside a shepherd's hut on rationbringing day than anything else i can think of
coolibaha basin made from the scooped out excrescence of a tree
as soon as i could sit a horse again i went to work at moongarr
i had found things there at a pretty pass
not a drop of rain had fallen up to now on the station for nearly nine months
you know what that means on the top of two dry seasons
as soon as i was fit we rode over the run inspectingi and ninnis and moongarr bill
there's a lot of riding over one thousand square miles and we didn't get our inspection done quickly
day after day we travelled through desolationgrass withered to chips creeks and waterholes all but empty cattle staggering like drunken men only it was for want of drink
the trees were dying in the wooded country and in the plains the earth was crumbling and shrinking and great cracks like crevasses were gaping in the black soil where there used to be beautiful green grass and flowers in spring
the lagoon was practically dried up and the little drain of water left was undrinkable because of the dead beasts that had got bogged and dropped dead in it
they were short of water at the headstation and we had to fetch it in from a waterhole several miles off that we fenced round and used for drinkingso long as it lasted
when we were mustering the other side of the run it came to our camping at a sandy creek where we could dig in the sand and get just enough for horses and men
the water of the bore i'd made was a bit brackish but it kept the grass alive round about and was all the cattle had to depend on
you can think of the job it was shifting the beasts over there from other parts of the run which was what we tried to do so long as they were fit for it
we were selling what we could while there was still life left in the herd but the cattle were too far gone for droving
we managed to collect a hundred or sosent them in trucks from crocodile creek terminus for boiling down and netted about thirty shillings a head on them
that was all
i guess thatby this time out of my eleven thousand head with no
 brand on them i'd muster from four to five hundred
the mistake i made was in not selling out for what i could get at the beginning of the drought
but it was the long time in leichardt's town that had me there
it was bad luck all through from first to last
mustering those beasts for boiling down started that old spear wound afresh
until it got well again there was nothing for it but to sit tight and wait
moongarr bill left to make a prospecting trip on my old tracks up the bighttook cudgee and the blackboy with him
he had an idea that he'd strike a place where we'd seen the colour of gold on our last expedition but weren't able then to investigate it
i've never been bitten by the gold fever like some fellows and i daresay that i've missed chances
but i thought cattle were a safer investment and i've seen too much misery and destruction come from following that gold will o' the wisp for me to have been tempted to run after it
old ninnis was the next to leave i made him take the offer of a job that he had
when it came to drawing water five miles for the headstation and keeping it in an iron tank sunk in the ground with a manhole and padlocked cover for fear of its being got at the fewer there were of us the better
now the station is being run by the boss and the malay boy who is a sharp little chap and more use in the circumstances than any white man
we've killed the calves we were trying to poddy
and the dogsexcept one cattle dogvenobiddy would remember her how she used to lollop about the front veranda outside her room
now what the deuce made me write thatwell the dog goes with me in the cart when i fetch water and takes her drink with the horses at the hole
poddyto bring up by hand
i'm getting used to the lifemaking jobs in the daytime to keep myself from feeling the place a worse hell than it really is
there's always the water to be fetched and the two horses and the dog to be taken for their big drink
if you could see me hoarding the precious stuffwashing my face in the morning in a soup plate and what's left kept for night for the dog
when i want a bath i ride ten miles to the bore
then there's saddlery to mend and drycleaning the place and pipes between whilesmore of them than is good for me
stores are low but i've still got enough of tobacco
i daresay it's a mercy there's no whiskeynothing but a bottle or two of brandy in case of snakebitesor i might have taken to it
thank god i've got a pretty strong will and i've never done as i see so many chaps do find forgetfulness in drinkbut there's no saying what a man may come to
it's the nights that are the worst
i'm glad to get up at dawn and see to the beasts
and there's that infernal watching of the skylooking out all the time for clouds that don't comeor if they do end in nothing
you know that brassy glare of the sun rising that means always scorching dry heat
think of it a hundred times worse than you've ever seen it
the country as far as you can look is like the floor of an enormous oven with the sky red and whitehot for a roof and all the life there is being slowly baked inside
the birds are getting scarce and it seems too much trouble for those that are about to lift their voices
except for a fiend of a laughingjackass in a gum tree close by the veranda that drives me mad with his devilish chuckling
well how do you think now that her ladyship would have stood up against these sort of conditions
many a time walking up and down the veranda when i couldn't sleep i've thanked my stars that there was no woman hanging on to me any more
most of the men on the river have sent away their womenstockmen's wives and all
there was one here at the bachelors' quarters but i packed her off before i went to leichardt's town
i'm just waiting on to get moongarr bill's report of the country up northhow it stands the drought and what the chances are for pushing out
as for the gold findwell i'm not banking on that
as soon as i hearor if i don't hear in the course of the next two or three weeksi shall pull up stakes and burn all my personal belongings except what a pair of saddle bags will carry
before long i'm going to begin packing biddy's things
they'll be shipped off to her all right
when the divorce business is over i shall make new tracks and you won't hear of me unless i come out on top
i've got a queer feeling inside me that i shall win through yet
well i'm finished and it's about time
i've run my pen over a good many sheets and it has been a kind of reliefi began writing this about three weeks ago
harry the blowerthat's the mailmancomes only once a month now and not on time at that
i suppose the drought will break sooner or later and when it breaks the bank is certain to send up and take possession of what's left
so i'm a ruined man any way
goodbye joan old friend
i've written to the lawyer and biddy will be served with the papers soon after this reaches you
i'm not sending her any message
if she doesn't understand there's no use in wordsbut you know this
she's been the one woman in the universe for meand there will never be another
he signed his name at the end of the letter and that was all
chapter    harry the blower came up with his mails a day or two later
among the letters he brought there were three at least of special importance to colin mckeith
one was from the late attorney general of leichardt's land in whose following he had been while sitting in the legislative assembly and whom he had consulted in reference to the divorce petition
this gentleman informed colin that proceedings were already begun in the case of mckeith versus mckeith and that notification of the pending suit had been sent to lady bridget at castle gaverick in the province of connaught ireland
the second letter was from the manager of the bank of leichardt's land regretfully conveying the decision of the board that failing immediate repayment of the loan the mortgage on moongarr station must be foreclosed and that in due course a representative of the bank would arrive to take over the property
the third letter was from moongarr bill dated from the furthest bush township at the foot of the great bight which had formed the base of colin's last exploring expedition
a mere outpost of civilisation it wasthat very one which he had described at the dinner party at government house where he had first met lady bridget o'hara
apparently in moongarr bill's estimation its only reason for existence lay in the fact that it had an office under the jurisdiction of the warden of goldfields for the proclamation of new goldfields and the obtaining of miner's rights
moongarr bill's epistolary style was bald in its directness
dear sir he began  the biggest mistake we ever made in our lives was not following up the streak of colour you spotted in that gully running down from bardo range to pelican river
if we had stopped and done a bit of stripping for alluvial for certain we should have found heavy shotty gold with only a few feet of stripping
but i've done better than thatgot on the leaddead on the gutter
to my belief that gully is the top dressing of a dried up underground watercourse
it's a pocket chock full of gold
you see it's like this  here followed technical details given in local golddigger's phraseology which would only be intelligible to a backwoods prospector or a leichardt's land mining expert
mckeith read all the details carefully turning the page over and back again in order to read it once more
there was no doubtmaking due allowance for moongarr bill's exaggerative optimismthat the find was a genuine one
the writer resumed  'i've pegged off a twenty men's ground thisbeing outside the area of a proclaimed goldfieldour reward as joint discoverers
the ground joins on to your old pegs and the wonder to me is that nobody has ever struck the place
however that's not so queer as you might think for there has been very little talk of gold up herein fact the pm does warden's work
besides the drought has kept squatters from pushing out and it's too far off for the casual prospector
luckily the drought has driven the blacks away too further into the ranges and i haven't seen any myalls this trip like the ones that went for us last time
it's a pity hensor pegged out then
he'd have come in for a slice of luck nowwe three being the only persons in the worlduntil i lodged my information at the warden's office this morningwho had ever raised the colour in this district or had any suspicion of a show
i reckon though that if the find turns out as i think you'll be making things up to little tommy
i'm to have my miners' right all properly filled up tomorrow and shall make tracks back to the gully at once so as to leave no chance of the claim being jumped
i've named it mckeith's find so your name won't be forgotten
i don't count on a big rush at firstall the better for youbut i shall be surprised if we are not entitled at the end of four months to our government reward of  pounds as there are pretty sure to be two hundred miners at work by that time
i'm writing to ninnisthough i don't know if he has done his job yettelling him to lose no time in getting here and you won't want telling to do the same
i reckon that whether the drought has broken by this time or not it will pay you better to start for here than to wait at the station until there are calves coming on to brand and muster
ninnis will be in with us all right and it would be a fine thing if you came up together
he's a firstrate man and has had a lot of experience in the californian goldfields
poor luck however or he wouldn't have come over to freeselect on the leura
it took me a good three weeks to get as far as the pelican creek and i couldn't have done it in the time if there had been blacks about
knowing the lay of the country too made it easier than it was before for us
cudgee has turned out a smarter boy than wombo was
no fear of myalls with their infernal jagged spears being round without his sniffing them
one of the horses died from eating poisonbush
don't go in for camping at a bend in pelican creek between it and a brigalow scrub first day you sight bardo range going up the creek where there's a pocket full of good grass one side of a broken slate ridgeit's no good
but i wouldn't swop the other horses for any of windeatt's famous breed
there's some things it would be well for you and ninnis to bring and a box of surveyor's compasses would come in handy
here followed half a page on practical matters and then the letter ended
mckeith pondered long over moongarr bill's letter as he sat in the veranda smoking and watching a little cloud on the horizon and wondering whether rain was coming at last
if moongarr bill was right the goldfind would mean a fresh start for him in his baulked career
at any rate it behoved him to take advantage of the chance and to go forth on the new adventure without unnecessary delay
but the savour was gone for him from adventurethe salt out of life
the stroke of luckif it were onehad come too late
and now the great drought had broken at last
next evening there came up a terrific thunderstorm and a hurricane such as had not visited the district for years
it broke in the direction of the gidia scrub and razed many trees
it passed over the headstation and travelled at a furious rate along the plain
hailstones fell as large as a pigeon's egg and stripped off such leafage as the drought had left
thunder volleyed and lightning blazed
part of the roof of the old humpey was torn off
the hidehouse was practically blown away
the great white cedar by the lagoon was struck by lightning and lay a chaos of dry branches and splintered limbs one side of the trunk standing up jagged and charred where it had been riven in two
upon the hurricane followed a steady deluge
for a night and a day the heavens were opened and poured waterspouts as though the pent rain of nine months were being discharged
the river 'came down' from the heads and filled the gully with a roaring flood
the lagoon was again almost level with its banks
the dry watercourse on the plain sparkled in the distance like a mirageonly that it was no mirage
no one who has not seen the extraordinary rapidity with which a dry river out west can be changed into a flooded one could credit the swiftness of the transformation
then the heavens closed once more
the sun shone out pitilessly bright and the surface earth looked after a few hours almost as dry as before
but the lifegiving fluid had penetrated deep into the soil the rivers and creeks were running green grass was already springing up for the beasts to feed upon
the land was saved
alas too late to save the ruined squatters
there were so few of their beasts left
nevertheless the rain brought new life and energy to the humans
kuppi the malay boy fetched buckets of water from the replenished lagoon and scoured and scrubbed with great alacrity
he came timidly to his master and asked if he might not wash out with boiling water the closed parlour and lady bridget's unused bedroom
he was afraid that the white ants might have got into them
mckeith's face frightened kuppi
so did the imprecation which his innocent request evoked
he was bidden to go and keep himself in his own quarters and not show his face again that day at the new house
since lady bridget's departure mckeith had slept eaten and worked in the old humpey his original dwelling
but kuppi did not know that the white ants had not been given a chance to work destruction upon 'the ladyship's' properties
regularly every day mckeith himself tended those sacred chambers
bridget's rooms were just as she had left them
he had done nothing yet towards dismantling that part of the new house in which she had chiefly lived
he had put off the task day after day
but since receiving moongarr bill's letter and now that the drought had broken and the man in possession a prospect as certain as that there would come another thunderstorm he knew that he must begin his preparations to quit moongarr
to do this meant depriving himself of the miserable comfort he found during wakeful nights and the first hour of dawnthe time he usually chose for sweeping and cleaning his wife's roomsof roaming ghostlike through the new house where every object spoke to him of her
in the day time he shrank from mounting the steps which connected the verandas but in the evenings he would often come and stroll along the veranda and sit in the squatter's chair she had liked or in the hammock where she had swung and smoke his pipe and brood upon the irrevocable past
and then he would suddenly rush off in frantic haste to do some hard physical work feeling that he must go mad if he sat still any longer
today however after kuppi had fled to the kitchen he went into his old dressing room and stood looking at the camp bed and thought of the day of bridget's fever when harris had given him her note to maule and he had sat here huddled on the edge of the bed wrestling dumbly with his agony
the association had been too painful and in his daily tendance he had somewhat neglected this room and had usually entered the other by the french window from the veranda
thus he saw now that a bloated tarantula had established itself in one corner between wall and ceiling and an uncanny looking white lizard scuttered across the boards and disappeared under a piece of furniture leaving its tail behind
a phenomenon of natural history at which he remembered now bridget had often wondered
he opened the door of communicationwhere on that memorable night he had knocked and received no answerand passed through it treading softly as though he were visiting a death chamber
and indeed to him it was truly a death chamber in which the bed all covered over with a white sheet might have been a bier and the pillows put lengthwise down it the shrouded form of one dearly loved and lost
he gazed about staring at the familiar pieces of furniture out of wide red eyes smarting with unshed tears
in her looking glass he seemed to see the ghostreflection of her small pale face with its old whimsical charm
the shadowy eyes under the untidy mass of redbrown hair in which the curls and tendrils stood out as if endowed with a magnetic life of their own the sensitive lips the little pointed chin and in the eyes and on the lips that gently mocking alluring smile
there were a few poems that colin had taught himself to say by heart and which he would recite to himself often when he was alone in the bush
the ancient mariner was one and there were some of rudyard kipling's and he loved the idylls of the kingin especial guinivere
three lines of that poem leaped to his memory at this moment
'thy shadow still would glide from room to room   and i should evermore be vext with thee   in hanging robe and vacant ornament'
he went to the wardrobe where her dresses hung as she had left them only that daily he had shaken them cared for them so that no hot climate pest should injure them
and in so doing he had been overwhelmingly conscious of the peculiar personal fragrance her garments had always exhaledan experience in which rapture and anguish blended
how he had loved her
 god
how he had loved her
 and yet latterly how he had got to take his supreme possession of her as a matter of course had allowed the joy of it to be blunted by depression and irritability over sordid station worries
he remembered with piercing remorse how often he had neglected the trivial courtesies to which he knew she attached importance
how he had been prone to sullen fits of moodiness had been rough even brutal as in that episode of the blacks
brutal to herthis dainty lady his fairy princess
 and now he had lost her
she was gone back to her own world and to her own kin
if only he had yielded to her then about the blacks
if he had curbed his anger shown sympathy with the two wild children of nature who were better than himself in this at least that they had known how to love and cling to each other in spite of the blows of fate
he had horsewhipped wombo for loving oola and swift retribution had come upon himself that he should have lost bridget because of the loves of wombo and oola
it was an ironyas if god were laughing at him
he set his teeth and laughedthe mirthless laugh which had startled harris well whether it were automatic or planned retribution on the part of the high powers the trouble could be evened up and done with
'i was a damned fool' he said to himself 'and i've been taught my lesson too late for me to benefit by it
except this wayi'm not going to be downed for ever
i'll go through my particular piece of hell on this darned old earth if i must and then i'll wipe the slate and come out on top of something else that isn't love
there's possibilities enough along the big bight to satisfy most men's ambition
and it's not much odds any way so long as she isn't seriously hurt'
with that summing up of the matter he seemed to gain stoic energy
now he went back to his dressing room and pulled out to the veranda a couple of worn portmanteaux
into these he put a variety of personal belongings
among them pictures from the walls and old photographs in frames that had been on the dressing table
it was significant that none of these were portraits of his wife
the portmanteaux he dragged along the veranda to the side of the steps leading down to the front garden
then instead of returning to lady bridget's room he attacked an escritoire in the parlour in which he had kept family and private papers and which flanked her chippendale bureau
he brought out another collectionnotebooks papers bundles of letters dating much further back than his occupation of moongarrsalvage from the wreck of his old home
his mother's workbox his father's shakespeare the family biblea piteous catalogue
he looked long at the book and the photographs
these last were portraits of his father his mother and his sisters who had all been massacred by the blacks when he was a boy
he separated all such relics from the general lot placing them and also two or three packets of papers upon a shelftable in the verandait was that table where lady bridget had laid the cablegram from lord gaverick which she had shown him the day before she had left moongarr
now it seemed to him an altar of sacred memories
he brought various other small things out of the parlourthings he had not the heart to destroyall belonging to his youthand placed them there
as he looked at them a sudden thought seemed to strike him and a wave of emotion passed over his face softening its hardness for an instant
but the grimness came back
he made a quick movement back to lady bridget's room and when after a minute or two he came out again he was carrying a curious object which he had taken out of the deep drawer beneath her hanging wardrobe
it was a dry piece of gumtree bark shrivelled and curled up at the sides so that the two edges almost met
at first he put it on the heap that he had turned out of the portmanteaux for destruction
his grim thought had been to top with this strange memorial of his marriagenight the funeral pyre he had intended to build
but again the spasm of emotion contorted his features
his shoulders shook and a dry choking sound came from his lips
he took up the piece of bark too and laid it with the daguerreotypes on the table
he seemed afraid to give himself time to think but went from room to room here and in the old humpey dragging one thing after another out on to the veranda
some of the heavier articles he had to hoist over the steps connecting the two verandas and then to drag them down the other steps into the front garden where they strewed the gravel round the centre bed
in spring and summer when the chinamen had been there to water and lady bridget to superintend the planting and pruning this bed had always been gay with flowers banking a tall shrub of scented verbena the perfume of which she had been particularly fond of
now there were weedsmost of them witheredinstead of flowers
the verbena bush had long been dead and the dry leaves and branches beaten down by the late storm made a bed of kindling
never was there garden so desolatethe young ornamental trees and shrubs all dead the creepers dead also even the hardy passion vines upon the fence mere leafless fruitless withes of withered stems
mckeith paused after lugging down two squatters' chairsthe first house carpentering he had done for his wife after their arrival at the headstation and in which he had resolved no future owner of moongarr should ever sit
that was the thought fiercely possessing him
rough chairs and tables and suchlike that had been there always might remain
but no sacrilegious hands should touch things made for her or with which she had been closely associated
they should be burned out here in the deserted front garden where not even kuppithe only other occupant of the headstationwould witness his preparations
he himself would lay and kindle the funeral pyre and tonight when there would be only the stars to see him he would light the first holocaust
he stood considering
sweat dropped from his forehead
his gaunt frame was trembling after his effort which had been heavy and he leaned against one of the tarred piles supporting the veranda to rest
but only for a few minutes
then his feverish activity recommenced
he piled up the wooden furniture on the bed of withered verbena branches filled the interstices with dead leaves that he collected from the garden laid the smaller thingsbooks papers pictureswhere they would assist the conflagration and did not stop until the pyre had reached to the level of the veranda railing
he reflected grimly that there was a chance of sparks setting fire to the house itself and calculated the extent of the gravel between deciding that if he was there to watch there would be no danger
all the time the old kangaroo dog veno had been nosing round him sniffing at the objects lying round then looking up at him with bleared wistful eyes and evidently unable to understand these strange proceedings
once or twice he had roughly pushed the dog away but when he had finished the work and seated himself from sheer fatigue on the veranda steps veno came and squatted beside him the dog's head upon his knee
he filled his pipe and smoked ruminatively the exertion had had one good effect it had dulled the fierceness of his pain
as he sat therea faint breeze that had risen with the approach of sunset cooling his heated bodyhe thought again about moongarr bill's letter
he looked at the great pyre in front and caught the gleam of the lagoon below through the bare branches of the trees the little ripple on its surface the freshening green at its marge
then he gazed out over the vast plain towards the horizon
from his low position on the steps the middle distance was hidden from him
through the reddish tinge cast by the lowering sun he could discern far off likewise the unmistakable signs of newspringing grass and the course of the river for so long nonexistent
from the gully he heard the sound of rushing water
it had been a roaring torrent just after the storm and he knew that a flood must have come down from the heads
yes the drought had broken
the plain would soon be green again
flowers would spring up as they had done for bridget's bridal homecoming
if the rain had fallen a few months sooner the station might have been saved
and even now with the remnant of three or four hundred cattle provided there were no crippling debt no spectre of the man in possession he might still hang on and in time retrieve his losses lie low sink artesian wells make the station secure for the future
he had been so fond of the place
he had taken up the run with such high hopes had so slaved to increase his herd to make improvements on the headstation
he had looked upon this as the nucleus of his fortune the pivot on which his career as one of the empirebuilders would revolve and now  well some clever speculator no doubt would buy it at a low price during the slump stock it with more cattle work it up during a good season or two and when cattle stations boomed once more sell it at an immense profit
that was what he himself would have done had he been a speculator in similar conditions
even still he could do it with a small amount of capital to supply a sop for the bank now that the drought had broken they would be more likely to let him go on
he thought of the  pounds sir luke tallant had made him put into settlement on his marriage
he had not wanted to do that at the time his scotch caution had revolted against the tying up of his resources and his instinct was justified
if only he had command of that money now
it was his own his wife was rich that was the one benefit he could have taken from her
but it was impossible to broach the question
suddenly the dog stirred uneasily sniffed the air and leaped to the gravel walk where it stood giving short uncertain barks as though aware of something happening outside for which it could not account
mckeith lifted his head bent in the absorption of his thought and looked about for the disturber of veno's placidity
but kuppi was nowhere in sight nor was there sign of other intruder
where he sat the garden fence overgrown with withered passion vines bounded his vision and had anybody ridden or driven up the hill through the lower sliprails he would not have seen them probably would not have heard them
for there were no longer dogs black boys chinamen or station hands to voice intimation of a new arrival
all the old sounds of evening activity were hushed
no musteringmob being driven to the stockyard no running up of milkers or horses for the morrow no goats to be pennedthey had been killed off long ago no beasts grazing or callingno audible life at all except that of the birds who since the rain had found their notes again and were telling each other vociferously that it was time to go to bed
indeed the silence and solitariness of the once busy headstation had enticed many of the shyer kinds of birds from the lagoon and the forest
listening as he now was intently mckeith could hear the gurgling coorooroo of the swamp pheasant which is always found near waterand likewise rare soundthe silvery ring of the bellbird rejoicing in the freshfilled lagoon
but veno was still uneasy and colin got up on to the veranda
he stood there listening all the while strained expectancy in his eyes as if he too were vaguely conscious of something outside happening  and now he did hear something that made him go white as with uncanny dread
it was a footstep that he heard on the veranda of the old humpeyvery light a soft tapping of high heels and the accompanying swish of draperya ghostly rustle'a ghostly footfall echoing'
for surely in this place it could have no human reality
it approached along the passage between the two buildings halted for a few seconds and then mounted to the front veranda
the man was standing with his back to the old humpey
he would not turn
a superstitious fear fell upon him and made his knees shake and his tall lean frame tremble
he dared not turn his head and look lest he should see that which would tell him bridget was dead
but the dead do not speak in syllables that an ordinary human ear can hear
and colin heard his own name spoken in accents piercingly clear and sweet
'colin'
to him though it was as a ghostvoice
he stood transfixed
and just then the dog bounded past him
it had flown up the steps barking loudly
that could be no immaterial form upon which the creature flung itself pawing nosing licking with the wildest demonstrations of joy
he heard the wellremembered tones  'quiet veno good dog
lie down venolie down'
the dog seemed to understand that this was not a moment for effusiveness
without another sound it crouched upon its haunches gazing up at the newcomer
then colin turned
bridget was standing not a yard from him
a slender figure in a grey silk cloak with bare headshe had flung back her grey sunbonnet and shrouding gauze veil
he saw the face he knewthe small pale face the shadowy eyes wide and bright with an ecstatic determination yet in them a certain feminine timorousness the little pointed chin poked slightly forward the redbrown hairall untidy curls and tendrils each hair seeming to have a life and magnetism of its own
it was just as he had so often pictured her in dreams of sleep and waking
he gazed at her like one who beholds a vision from another world
and then a great sob burst from himthe pitiful sob of a strong man who is beaten broken with emotion
the whole being of the man seemed to collapse
he staggered forward and such a change came over the gaunt hard face that bridget saw it through a rain of tears which fell down her cheeks
'oh colinwon't you speak to me'
'biddy'
he went close to her and gripped her two wrists holding her before him while his hungry eyes seemed to be devouring her
'it's youit's really you
you're not dead are you'
'dead
oh nono
i've come home'
'home'
he laughed
'oh don'tdon't' she cried
'don't laugh like that'
'home'
he repeated grimly
'look round you
a nice sort of home
eh'
'i don't care
it's the only real home i've ever had'
'but looklook'
she followed his eyes to the great pyre in the garden with the dead leaves and the pieces of furniture the squatters' chairs the little tables he and she had covered together the hammock that he had cut down leaving the ropes danglingmany other things that she recognised also
then her gaze came back to the veranda
to the open portmanteaux the different objects still strewing the ground and then to the shelftable against the wall near the hammock and there to his most cherished possessions
she knew at once his mother's workbox the shabby shakespearethe portraits and on top of all the piece of gumtree bark
she snatched her wrists from his grasp darted to the shelf seized the shrivelled pice of bark and pressed it against her bosom as though it had been a living thing
'oh you couldn't burn this
 you were going to burn it with the restbut you couldn'tany more than you could have burned your mother's things
i thought of it all the wayi knew that if you could burn this too there would be no hope for me any more
i prayed that you might not burn it'
'but howhow did you know i was going to burn the things'
he stammered bewilderedly
'i saw it alli saw youjust like this on the verandaso thin and hard and miserableand so proud yetand stubborni saw it allsaw the bonfire readyand i saw this piece of barkand then something made you stop and you put it with your mother's things instead
you rememberedoh
mate you did understand
you did rememberthat first night by the camp fireand we twojust we two'she broke off sobbing
'you sawyou saw' he kept saying
'but howhow did you know
tell me mate'
'i saw it all in a dreamat castle gaverick
three times i dreamed the same dream and i felt inside me that it was a prophetic warning
we're like that you know we irish celts
and youthough you're a scotchmanyou used to laugh at such things
but they're true they're truei've had glints of second sight before
joan gildea understood
when i told her she believed it was a warning god had sent me and she said i must go to yougo at once lest it should be too late
she wanted to come with me but it would have been difficult for her to leave her work and i didn't want heri wanted to come to you all on my own'
'and thenthen'
he asked breathlessly
'oh then i left castle gaverick at once and in london i took my passagethere was an e and a boat just going to start
of course i knew the route
i got out of the steamer at leuraville and came straight on by traini didn't wait anywhere
i thought i'd get out at crocodile creek and pay somebody to drive me up here
but you've got the railway brought nearer and when i got out at kangaroo flat there was a most extraordinary thingthen i knew why the voice inside had been urging me on so quickly'
'an extraordinary thing
what was it'
he said in the same breathless broken way
'it was mr ninnis
he was there standing on the platform just off his droving triphe was going to take the next train to leuraville
if i had stayed there as captain halliwell wanted me to i should have missed him
he'd got a letter from moongarr billoh i know all about that
but it doesn't matterit doesn't matter in the least
you can go if you like and find the goldi'll stop at joan gildea's cottage in leichardt's town and wait for youi don't care about anything if you'll only let me be your mate again
but colin' she rushed on for he could not speak and the sight of a great man struggling with his tears is one that a woman who loves him can scarcely bear to see
and yet the sight made bridget happy for all its pain'colin when i first saw ninnis do you know what i thought
that you had sent him to meet me
that you too had been warned in a dream'
'no i wish i had beenmy god i wish i had been'
'what would you have done colin'
'i'd have been there myself' he said simply
'it would have been me not ninnis that you saw at kangaroo flat station'
she held out her arms
the roll of bark dropped on the boards of the veranda
in a moment he was pressing her fiercely to his breast and his lips were on hers
and in that kiss by the divine alchemy of true wedded love all the past pride and bitterness were transmuted into a great abiding peace
