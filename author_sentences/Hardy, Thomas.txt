chapter i    description of farmer oak  an incident   when farmer oak smiled the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears his eyes were reduced to chinks and diverging wrinkles appeared round them extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun
his christian name was gabriel and on working days he was a young man of sound judgment easy motions proper dress and general good character
on sundays he was a man of misty views rather given to postponing and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella  upon the whole one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of laodicean neutrality which lay between the communion people of the parish and the drunken section  that is he went to church but yawned privately by the time the con gegation reached the nicene creed and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon
or to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion when his friends and critics were in tantrums he was considered rather a bad man when they were pleased he was rather a good man when they were neither he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepperandsalt mixture
since he lived six times as many workingdays as sundays oak's appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own  the mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in that way
he wore a lowcrowned felt hat spread out at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds and a coat like dr johnson's his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large affording to each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp  their maker being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity
mr oak carried about him by way of watch what may be called a small silver clock in other words it was a watch as to shape and intention and a small clock as to size
this instrument being several years older than oak's grandfather had the peculiarity of going either too fast or not at all
the smaller of its hands too occasionally slipped round on the pivot and thus though the minutes were told with precision nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to
the stopping peculiarity of his watch oak remedied by thumps and shakes and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours' windows till he could discern the hour marked by the greenfaced timekeepers within
it may be mentioned that oak's fob being difficult of access by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion and drawing up the watch by its chain like a bucket from a well
but some thoughtfull persons who had seen him walking across one of his fields on a certain december morning  sunny and exceedingly mild  might have regarded gabriel oak in other aspects than these
in his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on to manhood there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy
his height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his presence imposing had they been exhibited with due consideration
but there is a way some men have rural and urban alike for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and sinew  it is a way of curtail ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them
and from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no great claim on the world's room oak walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders
this may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well which oak did not
he had just reached the time of life at which young is ceasing to be the prefix of man in speaking of one
he was at the brightest period of masculine growth for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again in the character of prejudice by the influence of a wife and family
in short he was twentyeight and a bachelor
the field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called norcombe hill
through a spur of this hill ran the highway between emminster and chalk newton
casually glancing over the hedge oak saw coming down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon painted yellow and gaily marked drawn by two horses a waggoner walking alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly
the waggon was laden with household goods and window plants and on the apex of the whole sat a woman young and attractive
gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a minute when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his eyes
the tailboard of the waggon is gone miss
said the waggoner
then i heard it fall
said the girl in a soft though not particularly low voice
i heard a noise i could not account for when we were coming up the hill
i'll run back
do
she answered
the sensible horses stood  perfectly still and the waggoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance
the girl on the summit of the load sat motionless surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards backed by an oak settle and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums myrtles and cactuses together with a caged canary  all probably from the windows of the house just vacated
there was also a cat in a willow basket from the partlyopened lid of which she gazed with halfclosed eyes and affectionatelysurveyed the small birds around
the handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place and the only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary upand down the perches of its prison
then she looked attentively downwards
it was not at the bird nor at the cat it was at an oblong package tied in paper and lying between them
she turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming
he was not yet in sight and hereyes crept back to the package her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it
at length she drew the article into her lap and untied the paper covering a small swing lookingglass was disclosed in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively
she parted her lips and smiled
it was a fine morning and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair
the myrtles geraniums and cactuses packed around her were fresh and green and at such a leafless season they invested the whole concern of horses waggon furniture and girl with a peculiar vernal charm
what possessed her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrows blackbirds and unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators  whether the smile began as a factitious one to test her capacity in that art  nobody knows it ended certainly in a real smile
she blushed at herself and seeing her reflection blush blushed the more
the change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act  from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors  lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess
the picture was a delicate one
woman's prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight which had clothed it in the freshness of an originality
a cynical inference was irresistible by gabriel oak as he regarded the scene generous though he fain would have been
there was no necessity whatever for her looking in the glass
she did not adjust her hat or pat her hair or press a dimple into shape or do one thing to signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the glass
she simply observed herself as a fair product of nature in the feminine kind her thoughts seeming to glide into faroff though likely dramas in which men would play a part  vistas of probable triumphs  the smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won
still this was but conjecture and the whole series of actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any part in them at all
the waggoner's steps were heard returning
she put the glass in the paper and the whole again into its place
when the waggon had passed on gabriel withdrew from his point of espial and descending into the road followed the vehicle to the turnpikegate some way beyond the bottom of the hill where the object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll
about twenty steps still remained between him and the gate when he heard a dispute
lt was a difference con cerning twopence between the persons with the waggon and the man at the tollbar
mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things and she says that's enough that i've offered ye you great miser and she won't pay any more
these were the waggoner's words
very well then mis'ess's niece can't pass
said the turnpikekeeper closing the gate
oak looked from one to the other of the disputants and fell into a reverie
there was something in the tone of twopence remarkably insignificant
threepence had a definite value as money  it was an appreciable infringement on a day's wages and as such a higgling matter but twopence   here
he said stepping forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper let the young woman pass
he looked up at her then she heard his words and looked down
gabriel's features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the middle line between the beauty of st john and the ugliness of judas iscariot as represented in a window of the church he attended that not a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of distinction or notoriety
the redjacketed and dark haired maiden seemed to think so too for she carelessly glanced over him and told her man to drive on
she might have looked her thanks to gabriel on a minute scale but she did not speak them more probably she felt none for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point and we know how women take a favour of that kind
the gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle
that's a handsome maid he said to oak but she has her faults
said gabriel
true farmer
and the greatest of them is  well what it is always
beating people down
ay 'tis so
o no
what then
gabriel perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller's indifference glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance over the hedge and said vanity
chapter ii    night  the flock  an interior  another interior   it was nearly midnight on the eve of st thomas's the shortest day in the year
a desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill whereon oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of a few days earlier
norcombe hill  not far from lonely tollerdown   was one of the spots which suggest to a passerby that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth
it was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil  an ordinary specimen of those smoothlyoutlined protuber ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on some great day of confusion when far grander heights and dizzy granite precipices topple down
the hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying plantation of beeches whose upper verge formed a line over the crest fringing its arched curve against the sky like a mane
tonight these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest blasts which smote the wood and floundered through it with a sound as of grumbling or gushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened moan
the dry leaves in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few and sending them spinning across the grass
a group or two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude had remained till this very midwinter time on the twigs which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks with smart taps between this halfwooded half naked hill and the vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly com manded was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade   the sounds from which suggested that what it con cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here
the thin grasses more or less coating the hill were touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers and almost of differing natures  one rubbing the blades heavily another raking them piercingly another brushing them like a soft broom
the instinctive act of human kind was to stand and listen and learn how the trees to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral choir how hedges and other shapes to leeward them caught the note lowering it to the tenderest sob and how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south to be heard no more
the sky was clear  remarkably clear  and the twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of one body timed by a common pulse
the north star was directly in the wind's eye and since evening the bear had swung round it outwardly to the east till he was now at a right angle with the meridian
a difference of colour in the stars  oftener read of than seen in englandwas really perceptible here
the sovereign brilliancy of sirius pierced the eye with a steely glitter the star called capella was yellow aldebaran and betelgueux shone with a fiery red
to persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as this the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement
the sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects which is perceptible in a few minutes of still ness or by the better outlook upon space that a hill affords or by the wind or by the solitude but whatever be its origin the impression of riding along is vivid and abiding
the poetry of motion is a phrase much in use and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night and having first expanded with a sense of differ ence from the mass of civilised mankind who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at this time long and quietly watch your stately progress through the stars
after such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is hard to get back to earth and to believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from a tiny human frame
suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this place up against the sky
they had a clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in nature
they were the notes of farmer oak's flute
the tune was not floating unhindered into the open air  it seemed muffled in some way and was altogether too curtailed in power to spread high or wide
it came from the direction of a small dark object under the plantation hedge  a shepherd's hut  now presenting an outline to which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled to attach either meaning or use
the image as a whole was that of a small noah's ark on a small ararat allowing the traditionary outlines and general form of the ark which are followed by toy makers  and by these means are established in men's imaginations among their firmest because earliest im pressions  to pass as an approximate pattern
the hut stood on little wheels which raised its floor about a foot from the ground
such shepherds' huts are dragged into the fields when the lambing season comes on to shelter the shepherd in his enforced nightly attendance
it was only latterly that people had begun to call gabriel farmer oak
during the twelvemonth pre ceding this time he had been enabled by sustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the small sheep farm of which norcombe hill was a portion and stock it with two hundred sheep
previously he had been a bailiff for a short time and earlier still a shepherd only having from his childhood assisted his father in tending the flocks of large proprietors till old gabriel sank to rest
this venture unaided and alone into the paths of farming as master and not as man with an advance of sheep not yet paid for was a critical juncture with gabriel oak and he recognised his position clearly
the first movement in his new progress was the lambing of his ewes and sheep having been his speciality from his youth he wisely refrained from deputing  the task of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice
the wind continued to beatabout the corners of the hut but the fluteplaying ceased
a rectangular space of light appeared in the side of the hut and in the opening the outline of farmer oak's figure
he carried a lantern in his hand and closing the door behind him came forward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly twenty minutes the lantern light appear ing and disappearing here and there and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it
oak's motions though they had a quietenergy were slow and their deliberateness accorded well with his occupation
fitness being the basis of beauty nobody couldhave denied that his steady swings and turns in and about the flock had elements of grace yet although if occasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a dash as can the men of towns who are more to the manner born his special power morally physically and mentally was static owing little or nothing to momentum as a rule
a close examination of the ground hereabout even by the wan starlight only revealed how a portion of what would have been casually called a wild slope had been appropriated by farmer oak for his great purpose this winter
detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the ground at various scattered points amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled
the ring of the sheepbell which had been silent during his absence recommenced in tones that had more mellowness than clearness owing to an increasing growth of surrounding wool
this continued till oak withdrew again from the flock
he    returned to the hut bringing in his arms a newborn lamb consisting of four legs large enough for a full grown sheep united by a seemingly inconsiderable mem brane about half the substance of the legs collectively which constituted the animal's entire body just at present
the little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small stove where a can of milk was simmer ing
oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff the cot being lighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire
a rather hard couch formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down covered half the floor of this little habitation and here the young man stretched himself along loosened his woollen cravat and closed his eyes
in about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have decided upon which side to lie farmer oak was asleep
the inside of the hut as it now presented itself was cosy and alluring and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle reflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach flung associations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools
in the corner stood the sheepcrook and along a shelf at one side were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple prepara tions pertaining to bovine surgery and physic spirits of wine turpentine tar magnesia ginger and castoroil being the chief
on a triangular shelf across the corner stood bread bacon cheese and a cup for ale or cider which was supplied from a flagon beneath
beside the provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious hour
the house was ventilated by two round holes like the lights of a ship's cabin with wood slides the lamb revived by the warmth began to bleat instant meaning as expected sounds will
passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation he looked at his watch found that the hour hand had shifted again put on his hat took the lamb in his arms and carried it into the darkness
after placing the little creature with its mother he stood and carefully examined the sky to ascertain the time of night from the altitudes of the stars
the dogstar and aldebaran pointing to the restless pleiades were halfway up the southern sky and between them hung orion which gorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now as it soared forth above the rim of the landscape
castor and pollux will the northwest far away through the plantation vega and cassiopeia's chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs
one o'clock
said gabriel
being a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some charm in this life he led he stood still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument and regarded it in an appreciative spirit as a work of art superlatively beautiful
for a moment he seemed impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene or rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man
human shapesinterferences troubles and joys were all as if they were not and there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side
occupied this with eyes stretched afar oak gradually per ceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing
it was an artificial light almost close at hand
to find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable and expected makes some people fearful but a case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when intuition sensation memory analogy testimony probability induction  every kind of evidence in the logician's list  have united to persuade con sciousness that it is quite in isolation
farmer oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side
a dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground
in front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative
through crevices in the roof and side spread streaks and spots of light a combination of which made the radiance that had attracted him
oak stepped up behind whereleaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole he could see into the interior clearly
the place contained two women and two cows
by the side of the latter a steaming branmash stood in a bucket
one of the women was past middle age
her companion was ap parently young and graceful he could form no decided opinion upon her looks her position being almost beneath his eye so that he saw her in a bird'seye view as milton's satan first saw paradise
she wore no bonnet or het but had enveloped her self in a large cloak which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering
there now we'll go home said the elder of the two resting  her knuckles upon her hips and looking at their goingson as a whole
i do hope daisy will fetch round again now
i have never been more frightened in my life but i don't mind break ing my rest if she recovers
the young woman whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall together on the smallest provocation of silenceyawned in sympathy
i wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things she said
as we are not we must do them ourselves said the other for you must help me if you stay
well my hat is gone however continued the younger
it went over the hedge i think
the idea of such a slight wind catching it
the cow standing erect was of the devon breed and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich indian red as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour her long back being mathematically level
the other was spottedgrey and white
beside her oak now noticed a little calf about a day old looking idiotically at the two women which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight and often turn ing to the lantern which it apparently mistook for the moon
inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience
between the sheep and the cows lucina had been busy on norcombe hill lately
i think we had better send for some oatmeal said the yes aunt and i'll ride over for it as soon as it is light
but there's no sidesaddle
i can ride on the other  trust me
oak upon hearing these remarks became more curious to observe her features but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak and by his aerial position he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details
in making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the warts within us whatever our eyes bring in
had gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her  countenance his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one
having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy he painted her a beauty
by one of those whimsical coincidences in which nature like a busy mother seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile the girl now dropped the cloak and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket
oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon myrtles and lookingglass  prosily as the woman who owed him twopence
they placed the calf beside its mother again took up the lantern and went out the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula
gabriel oak returned to his flock
chapter iii    a girl on horseback  conversation   the sluggish day began to break
even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there oak went again into the plantation
lingering and musing here he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back ascending by the path leading past the cattle shed
she was the young woman of the night before
gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind possibly she had come to look for it
he hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among the leaves
gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut
here he ensconced himself and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the riders approach
she came up and looked around  then on the other side of the hedge
gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected per formance induced him to suspend the action for the present
the path after passing the cowshed bisected the plantation
it was not a bridlepath  merely a pedestrian's track and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them
the girl who wore no ridinghabit looked around for a moment as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back her head over its tail her feet against its shoulders and her eyes to the sky
the rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher  its noiselessness that of a hawk
gabriel's eyes had scarcely been able to follow her
the tall lank pony seemed used to such doings and ambled along unconcerned
thus she passed under the level boughs
the performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head and its tail and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation she began to adopt another even more obviously convenient than the first
she had no sidesaddle and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un attainable sideways
springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling and satisfying her self that nobody was in sight she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle though hardly expected of the woman and trotted off in the direction of tewnell mill
oak was amused perhaps a little astonished and hanging up the hat in his hut went again among his ewes
an hour passed the girl returned properly seated now with a bag of bran in front of her
on nearing the cattleshed she was met by a boy bringing a milkingpail who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off
the boy led away the horse leaving the pail with the young woman
soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came in regular succession from within the shed the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow
gabriel took the lost hat in his hand and waited beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill
she came the pail in one hand hanging against her knee
the left arm was extended as a balance enough of it being shown bare to make oak wish that the event ha happened in the summer when the whole would have been revealed
there was a bright air and manner about her now by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be upon the whole true
like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power
it was with some surprise that she saw gabriel's face rising like the moon behind the hedge
the adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than a difference
the startingpoint selected by the judgment was
her height she seemed tall but the pail was a small one and the hedge diminutive hence making allowance for error by comparison with these she could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best
all features of consequence were severe and regular
it may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty that in englishwoman a classicallyformed face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern the highlyfinished features being generally too large for the remainder of the frame that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves
without throwing a nymphean tissue over a milkmaid let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of place and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure
from the contours of her figure in its upper part she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them
had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush
yet she was not a shy girl by any means it was merely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do it in towns
that the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she caught oak's eyes conning the same page was natural and almost certain
the self consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced dignity if a little less
rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts she brushed hers with her hand as if gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch and the free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself
yet it was the man who blushed the maid not at all
i found a hat
said oak
it is mine
said she and from a sense of proportion kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis tinctly  it flew away last night
one o'clock this morning
well  it was
she was surprised
how did you know
she said
i was here
you are farmer oak are you not
that or thereabouts
i'm lately come to this place
a large farm
she inquired casting her eyes round and swinging back her hair which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass but it being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with a colour of their own
no not large
about a hundred
in speaking of farms the word acres is omitted by the natives by analogy to such old expressions as a stag of ten
i wanted my hat this morning
she went on
i had to ride to tewnell mill
yes you had
how do you know
i saw you
where
she inquired a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill
heregoing through the plantation and all down the hill
said farmer oak with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his mind as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named and then turned back to meet his colloquist's eyes
a perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a theft
recollection of the strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was suc ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation and that by a hot face
it was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule not a point in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rosecolour
from the maiden's blush through all varieties of the provence down to the crimson tuscany the countenance of oak's acquaintance quickly graduated whereupon he in con siderateness turned away his head
the sympathetic man still looked the other way and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again
he heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze and looked
she had gone away
with an air between that of tragedy and comedy
gabriel returned to his work
five mornings and evenings passed
the young woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one but never allowed her vision to stray in the direction of oak's person
his want of tact had deeply offended her  not by seeing what he could not help but by letting her know that he had seen it
for as without law there is no sin without eyes there is no indecorum and she appeared to feel that gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance
it was food for great regret with him it was also a contretemps which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction
the acquaintanceship might however have ended in a slow forgetting but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week
one afternoon it began to freeze and the frost increased with evening which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds
it was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets when round the drawingroom fire of a thickwalled mansion the sitters' backs are cold even whilst their faces are all aglow
many a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs
as the milkinghour drew near oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed
at last he felt cold and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove
the wind came in at the bottom of the door and to prevent it oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south
then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole  of which there was one on each side of the hut
gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open  that chosen being always on the side away from the wind
closing the slide to windward he turned to open the other on second  thoughts the farmer con sidered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two till the temperature of the hut was a little raised
he sat down
his head began to ache in an unwonted manner and fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights oak decided to get up open the slide and then allow himself to fall asleep
he fell asleep however without having performed the necessary preliminary
how long he remained unconscious gabriel never knew
during the first stages of his return to percep tion peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment
his dog was howling his head was aching fearfully  somebody was pulling him about hands were loosening his neckerchief
on opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness
the young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him
more than this  astonishingly more  his head was upon her lap his face and neck were disagreeably wet and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar
whatever is the matter
said oak vacantly
she seemed to experience mirth but of too insignifi cant a kind to start enjoyment
nothing now' she answered since you are not dead it is a wonder you were notsuffocated in this hut of yours
ah the hut
murmured gabriel
i gave ten pounds for that hut
but i'll sell it and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times curl up to sleep in a lock of straw
it played me nearly the same trick the other day
gabriel by way of emphasis brought down his fist upon the floor
it was not exactly the fault of the hut
she ob served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty among women  one who finished a thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it
you should i think have considered and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed
yes i suppose i should
said oak absently
he was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her his head upon her dress before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things
he wished she knew his impressions but he would as soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language
so he remained silent
she made him sit up and then oak began wiping his face and shaking himself like a samson
how can i thank 'ee
he said at last gratefully some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face
oh never mind that
said the girl smiling and allowing her smile to hold good for gabriel's next remark whatever that might prove to be
how did you find me
i heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when i came to the milking it was so lucky daisy's milking is almost over for the season and  i shall not come here after this week or the next
the dog saw me and jumped over to me and laid hold of my skirt
i came across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the slides were closed
my uncle has a hut like this one and i have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open
i opened the door and there you were like dead
i threw the milk over you as there was no water forgetting it was warm and no use
i wonder if i should have died
gabriel said in a low voice which was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her
o no the girl replied
she seemed to prefer a less tragic probability to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed  and she shunned it
i believe you saved my life miss    i don't know your name
i know your aunt's but not yours
i would just as soon not tell it  rather not
there is no reason either why i should as you probably will never have much to do with me
still i should like to know
you can inquire at my aunt's  she will tell you
my name is gabriel oak
and mine isn't
you seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively gabriel oak
you see it is the only one i shall ever have and i must make the most of it
i always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable
i should think you might soon get a new one
mercy
 how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people gabriel oak
well missexcuse the wordsi thought you would like them but i can't match you i know in napping out my mind upon my tongue
i never was very clever in my inside
but i thank you
come give me your hand
she hesitated somewhat disconcerted at oak's old fashioned earnest conclusion
to a dialogue lightly carried on
very well
she said and gave him her hand compressing her lips to a demure impassivity
he held it but an instant and in his fear of being too demonstrative swerved to the opposite extreme touching her fingers with the lightness of a smallhearted person
i am sorry
he said the instant after
what for
you may have it again if you like there it is
she gave him her hand again
oak held it longer this time  indeed curiously long
how soft it is  being winter time too  not chapped or rough or anything
he said
there  that's long enough
said she though with out pulling it away but i suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it
you may if you want to
i wasn't thinking of any such thing
said gabriel simply but i will that you won't
she snatched back her hand
gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact
now find out my name
she said teasingly and withdrew
chapter iv    gabriel's resolve  the visit  the mistake   the only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is as a rule that of the unconscious kind but a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the subordinated man
this wellfavoured and comely girl soon made appre ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young farmer oak
love being an extremely exacting usurer a sense of exorbitant profit spiritually by an exchange of hearts being at the bottom of pure passions as that of exorbi tant profit bodily or materially is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere every morning oak's feelings were as sensitive as the moneymarket in calculations upon his chances
his dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which oak waited for the girl's presence that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance felt it lowering and would not look at the dog
however he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself
oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin passionate tales        full of sound and fury     signifying nothing  he said no word at all
by making inquiries he found that the girl's name was bathsheba everdene and that the cow would go dry in about seven days
he dreaded the eight day
at last the eighth day came
the cow had ceased to give milk for that year and bathsheba everdene came up the hill no more
gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before
he liked saying bathsheba' as a private enjoyment instead of whistling turned over his taste to black hair though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy isolated himself till the space he filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness
marriage transforms a distraction into a support the power of which should be and happily often is in direct pro portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants
oak began now to see light in this direction and said to himself i'll make her my wife or upon my soul i shall be good for nothing
all this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of bathsheba's aunt
he found his opportunity in the death of a ewe mother of a living lamb
on a day which had a summer face and a winter constitutiona fine january morning when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfullydisposed people wish for more and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine oak put the lamb into a respectable sunday basket and stalked across the fields to the house of mrs hurst the aunt  george the dog walking behind with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking
gabriel had watched the blue woodsmoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation
at evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin  seen the hearth and bathsheba beside it  beside it in her outdoor dress for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called bath sheba everdene
he had made a toilet of a nicelyadjusted kind  of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate  of a degree between finemarketday and wet sunday selection
he thoroughly cleaned his silver watchchain with whiting put new lacing straps to his boots looked to the brass eyeletholes went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walkingstick and trimmed it vigorously on his way back took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothesbox put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either and used all the hairoil he possessed upon his usually dry sandy and inextricably curly hair till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour between that of guano and roman cement making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb
nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save  the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them
it seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one for as the rather untoward commence ment of oak's overtures just as he arrived by the garden gate he saw a cat inside going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog george
the dog took no notice  for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath  in fact he never barked even at the sheep except to order when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance as a sort of com minationservice which though offensive had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good
a voice came from behind some laurelbushes into which the cat had run poor dear
did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it  did he poor dear
i beg your pardon
said oak to the voice but george was walking on behind me with a temper as mild as milk
almost before he had ceased speaking oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer
nobody appeared and he heard the person retreat among the bushes
gabriel meditated and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie
where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure
oak went up to the door a little abashed  his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening
bathsheba's aunt was indoors
will you tell miss everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to her
said mr oak
calling one's self merely some body without giving a name is not to be taken as an example of the illbreeding of the rural world it springs from a refined modesty of which townspeople with their cards and announcements have no notion whatever
bathsheba was out
the voice had evidently been hers
will you come in mr
oak
oh thank 'ee said gabriel following her to the fireplace
i've brought a lamb for miss everdene
i thought she might like one to rear girls do
she might
said mrs hurst musingly  though she's only a visitor here
if you will wait a minute bathsheba will be in
yes i will wait
said gabriel sitting down
the lamb isn't really the business i came about mrs hurst
in short i was going to ask her if she'd like to be married
and were you indeed
yes
because if she would i should be very glad to marry her
d'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all
let me think said mrs hurst poking the fire superfluously yes  bless you ever so many young men
you see farmer oak she's so goodlooking and an excellent scholar besides  she was going to be a governess once you know only she was too wild
not that her young men ever come here  but lord in the nature of women she must have a dozen
that's unfortunate
said farmer oak contemplating a crack in the stone floor with sorrow
i'm only an everyday sort of man and my only chance was in being the first comer  well there's no use in my waiting for that was all i came about so i'll take myself off homealong mrs
hurst
when gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down he heard a hoihoi
uttered behind him in a piping note of more treble quality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when shouted across a field
he looked round and saw a girl racing after him waving a white handkerchief
oak stood still  and the runner drew nearer
it was bathsheba everdene
gabriel's colour deepened hers was already deep not as it appeared from emotion but from running
farmer oak  i   she said pausing for want of breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side
i have just called to see you said gabriel pending her further speech
yesi know that
she said panting like a robin her face red and moist from her exertions like a peony petal before the sun dries off the dew
i didn't know you had come to ask to have me or i should have come in from the garden instantly
i ran after you to say  that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me       gabriel expanded
i'm sorry to have made you run so fast my dear
he said with a grateful sense of favours to come
wait a bit till you've found your breath
 it was quite a mistakeaunt's telling you i had a young man already
 bathsheba went on
i haven't a sweetheart at all  and i never had one and i thought that as times go with women it was such a pity to send you away thinking that i had several
really and truly i am glad to hear that
said farmer oak smiling one of his long special smiles and blushing with gladness
he held out his hand to take hers which when she had eased her side by pressing it there was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loudbeating heart
directly he seized it she put it behind her so that it slipped through his fingers like an eel 
i have a nice snug little farm
said gabriel with half a degree less assurance than when he had seized her hand
yes you have
a man has advanced me money to begin with but still it will soon be paid off and though i am only an everyday sort of man i have got on a little since i was a boy
gabriel uttered a little in a tone toshow her that it was the complacent form of a great deal
e continued   when we be married i am quite sure i can work twice as hard as i do now
he went forward and stretched out his arm again
bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush now laden with red berries
seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure if not compression of her person she edged off round the bush
why farmer oak
she said over the top looking at him with rounded eyes i never said i was going to marry you
well  that is a tale
said oak  with dismay
to run after anybody like this and then say you don't want him
what i meant to tell you was only this
she said eagerly and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for herself  that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart instead of my having a dozen as my aunt said i hate to be thought men's property in that way though possibly i shall be had some day
why if i'd wanted you i shouldn't have run after you like this 'twould have been the forwardest thing
but there was no harm in 'hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you
oh no  no harm at all
but there is such a thing as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls ively and oak added with a more appreciative sense of all the circumstances  well i am not quite certain it was no harm
indeed i hadn't time to think before starting whether i wanted to marry or not for you'd have been gone over the hill
come
said gabriel freshening again think a minute or two
i'll wait a while miss everdene
will you marry me
do bathsheba
i love you far more than common
i'll try to think
she observed rather more timor ously if i can think out of doors my mind spreads away so
but you can give a guess
then give me time
bathsheba looked thought fully into the distance away from the direction in which gabriel stood
i can make you happy said he to the back of her head across the bush
you shall have as piano in a year or two  farmers' wives are getting to have pianos now   and i'll practise up the flute right well to play with you in the evenings
yes i should like that
and have one of those little tenpound gigs for market  and nice flowers and birds  cocks and hens i mean because they be useful
continued gabriel feeling balanced between poetry and practicality
i should like it very much
and a frame for cucumbers  like a gentleman and lady
yes
and when the wedding was over we'd have it put in the newspaper list of marriages
dearly i should like that
and the babies in the births  every man jack of em
and at home by the fire whenever you look up there i shall be  and whenever i look up there will be you
wait wait and don't be improper
her countenance fell and she was silent awhile
he regarded the red berries between them over and over again to such an extent that holly seemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of marriage
bathsheba decisively turned to him
no 'tis no use
she said
i don't want to marry you
try
i have tried hard all the time i've been thinking for a marriage would be very nice in one sense
people would talk about me and think i had won my battle and i should feel triumphant and all that but a husband      well
why he'd always be there as you say whenever i looked up there he'd be
of course he would  i that is
well what i mean is that i shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding if i could be one without having a husband
but since a woman can't show off in that way by herself i shan't marry  at least yet
that's a terrible wooden story
at this criticism of her statement bathsheba made an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away from him
upon my heart and soul i don't know what a maid can say stupider than that
said oak
but dearest
he continued in a palliative voice don't be like it
oak sighed a deep honest sigh  none the less so in that being like the sigh of a pine plantation it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo sphere
why won't you have me
he appealed creeping round the holly to reach her side
i cannot
she said retreating
but why
he persisted standing still at last in despair of ever reaching her and facing over the bush
because i don't love you
yes but     she contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness so that it was hardly illmannered at all
i don't love you
she said
but i love you  and as for myself i am content to be liked
o mr oak  that's very fine
you'd get to despise me
never
said mr oak so earnestly that he seemed to be coming by the force of his words straight through the bush and into her arms
i shall do one thing in this life  one thing certain  that is love you and long for you and keep wanting you till i die
his voice had a genuine pathos now and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled
it seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much
she said with a little distress and looking hopelessly around for some means of escape from her moral dilemma
how i wish i hadn't run after you
however she seemed to have a short cut for getting back to cheerfulness and set her face to signify archness
it wouldn't do mr oak
i want somebody to tame me i am too independent and you would never be able to i know
oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was useless to attempt argument
mr
oak
she said with luminous distinctness and common sense  you are better off than i i have hardly a penny in the world  i am staying with my aunt for my bare sustenance
i am better educated than you  and i don't love you a bit that's my side of the case
now yours you are a farmer just begin ing and you ought in common prudence if you marry at all which you should certainly not think of doing at present to marry a woman with money who would admiration
that's the very thing i had been thinking myself
he naively said
farmer oak had oneandahalf christian character istics too many to succeed with bathsheba  his humility and a superfluous moiety of honesty
bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted well then why did you come and disturb me
she said almost angrily if not quite an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek
i can't do what i think would be  would be     right
no  wise
you have made an admission now mr
oak
she exclaimed with even more hauteur and rocking her head disdainfully
after that do you think i could marry you
not if i know it
he broke in passionately
but don't mistake me like that
because i am open enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought of you make your colours come up your face and get crabbed with me
that about your not being good enough for me is nonsense
you speak like a lady  all the parish notice it and your uncle at weatherbury is i have heerd a large farmer  much larger than ever i shall be
may i call in the evening or will you walk along with me o' sundays
i don't want you to makeup your mind at once if you'd rather not
no  no  i cannot
don't press me any more  don't
i don't love you  so 'twould be ridiculous he said with a laugh
no man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merrygoround of skittishness
very well
said oak firmly with the bearing of one who was going to give  his days and nights to ecclesiastes for ever
then i'll ask you no more
chapter v    departure of bathsheba  a pastoral tragedy   the news which one day reached gabriel that bath sheba everdene had left the neighbourhood had an influence upon him which might have surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the renun ciation the less absolute its character
it may have been observed that there is no regula path for getting out of love as there is for getting in
some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way but it has been known to fail
separation which was the means that chance offered to gabriel oak by bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people of certain humours is apt to idealise the removed object with others  notably those whose affection placid and regular as it may be flows deep and long
oak belonged to the eventempered order of humanity and felt the secret fusion of himself in bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now that she was gone  that was all
his incipient friendship with her aunthad been nipped by the failure of his suit and all that oak learnt of bathsheba's movements was done indirectly
it ap peared that she had gone to a place called weatherbury more than twenty miles off but in what capacity  whether as a visitor or permanently he could not discover
gabriel had two dogs
george the elder exhibited an ebonytipped nose surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh and a coat marked in random splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey but the grey after years of sun and rain had been scorched and washed out of the more prominent locks leaving them of a reddishbrown as if the blue component of the grey had faded like the indigo from the same kind of colour in turner's pictures
in substance it had originally been hair but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and staple
this dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and dreadful temper and the result was that george knew the exact degrees of condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood
long experience had so precisely taught the animal the difference between such exclamations as come in
and d     ye come in
that he knew to a hair's breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes' tails that each call involved if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped
though old he was clever and trustworthy still
the young dog george's son might possibly have been the image of his mother for there was not much resemblance between him and george
he was learn ing the sheepkeeping business so as to follow on at the flock when the other should die but had got no further than the rudiments as yet  still finding an insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well
so earnest and yet so wrongheaded was this young dog he had no name in particular and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant interjection that if sent behind the flock to help them on he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to step by the example of old george
thus much for the dogs
on the further side of norcombe hill was a chalkpit from which chalk had been drawn for generations and spread over adjacent farms
two hedges converged upon it in the form of a v but without quite meeting
the narrow opening left which was immediately over the brow of the pit was protected by a rough railing
one night when farmer oak had returned to his house believing there would be no further necessity for his attendance on the down he called as usual to the dogs previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till next morning
only one responded  old george the othercould not be found either in the house lane or garden
 gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb a kind of meat he usually kept from them except when other foodran finished his meal he went indoors to the luxury of a bed which latterly he had only enjoyed on sundays
it was a still moist night
just before dawn he was assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music
to the shepherd the note of the sheep chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing ever distant that all is well in the fold
in the solemn this exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways  by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell as when the flock breaks into new pasture which gives it an intermittent rapidity or by the sheep starting off in a run when the sound has a regular palpitation
the experienced ear of oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity
he jumped out of bed dressed tore down the lane through a foggy dawn and ascended the hill
the forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later there being two hundred of the latter class in gabriel's flock
these two hundred seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill
there were the fifty with their lambs enclosed at the other end as he had left them but the rest forming the bulk of the flock were nowhere
gabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd's call
ovey ovey ovey
not a single bleat
he went to the hedge  a gap had been broken through it and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep
rather surprised to find them break fence at this season yet putting it down instantly to their great fondness for ivy in wintertime of which a great deal grew in the plantation he followed through the hedge
they were not in the plantation
he called again  the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost hylas on the mysian shore but no sheep
he passed through the trees and along the ridge of the hill
on the extreme summit where the ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow of the chalkpit he saw the younger dog standing against the sky  dark and motionless as napoleon at st helena
a horrible conviction darted through oak
with a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced  at one point the rails were broken through and there he saw the footprints of his ewes
the dog came up licked his hand and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for signal services rendered
oak looked over the precipice
the ewes lay dead and dying at its foot  a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses representing in their condition just now at least two hundred more
oak was an intensely humane man indeed his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy and carried him on as by gravitation
a shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton  that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep
his first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs
it was a second to remember another phase of the matter
the sheep were not insured
all the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low  possibly for ever
gabriel's energies patience and industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and eightandtwenty to reach his present stage of progress that no more seemed to be left in him
he hands
stupors however do not last for ever and farmer oak recovered from his
it was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness   thank god i am not married  what would she have done in the poverty now coming upon me
oak raised his head and wondering what he could do listlessly surveyed the scene
by the outer margin of the pit was an oval pond and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chromeyellow moon which had only a few days to last  the morning star dogging her on the left hand
the pool glittered like a dead man's eye and as the world awoke a breeze blew shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon without breaking it and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric streak upon the water
all this oak saw and remembered
as far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog still under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep the more he ran after them the better had at the end of his meal off the dead lamb which may have given him additional energy and spirits collected all the ewes into a corner driven the timid creatures through the hedge across the upper field and by main force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the rotten railing and so hurled them over the edge
george's son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live and was in fact taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that same day  another instance of the untoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise
gabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer  on the strength of oak's promising look and character  who was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off oak found that the value of stock plant and implements which were really his own would be about sufficient to pay his debts leaving himself a free man with the clothes he stood up in and nothing more
chapter vi    the fair  the journey  the fire   two months passed away
we are brought on to a day in february on which was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the countytown of casterbridge
at one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon chance   all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation and pleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same among these carters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whipcord twisted round their hats thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw shepherds held their sheepcrooks in their hands and thus the situation required was known to the hirers at a glance
in the crowd was an athletic young fellow of some what superior appearance to the rest  in fact his superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly as to a farmer and to use sir' as a finishing word
his answer always was i am looking for a place myself  a bailiff's
do ye know of anybody who wants one
gabriel was paler now
his eyes were more medi tative and his expression was more sad
he had passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away
he had sunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very slimepits of siddim but there was left to him a digni fied calm he had never before known and that indiffer ence to fate which though it often makes a villain of a man is the basis of his sublimity when it does not
and thus the abasement had been exaltation and the loss gain
in the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town and a sergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets
as the end of the day drew on and he found himself not hired gabriel almost wished that he had joined them and gone off to serve his country
weary of standing in the market place and not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to he decided to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff
all the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds
sheeptending was gabriel's speciality
turning down an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane he went up to a smith's shop
how long would it take you to make a shepherd's crook
twenty minutes
how much
two shillings
he sat on a bench and the crook was made a stem being given him into the bargain
he then went to a readymade clothes' shop the owner of which had a large rural connection
as the crook had absorbed most of gabriel's money he attempted and carried out an exchange of his overcoat for a shepherd's regulation smockfrock
this transaction having been completed he again hurried off to the centre of the town and stood on the kerb of the pavement as a shepherd crook in hand
now that oak had turned himself into a shepherd it seemed that bailifs were most in demand
however two or three farmers noticed him and drew near
dialogues followed more or lessin the subjoined for  where do you come from
norcombe
that's a long way
fifteen miles
who's farm were you upon last
my own
this reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera
the inquiring farmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously
gabriel like his dog was too good to be trustworthy
and he never made advance beyond this point
it is safer to accept any chance that offers itself and extemporize a procedure to fit it than to get a good shepherd but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair
it grew dusk
some merry men were whistling and singing by the cornexchange
gabriel's hand which had lain for some time idle in his smockfrock pocket touched his flute which he carried there
here was an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom into practice
he drew out his flute and began to play jockey to the fair in the style of a man who had never known moment's sorrow
oak could pipe with arcadian sweetness and the sound of the wellknown notes cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers
he played on with spirit and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute man
by making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at shottsford the next day
how far is shottsford
ten miles t'other side of weatherbury
weatherbury
it was where bathsheba had gone two months before
this information was like coming from night into noon
how far is it to weatherbury
five or six miles
bathsheba had probably left weatherbury long before this time but the place had enough interest attaching to it to lead oak to choose shottsford fair as his next field of inquiry because it lay in the weatherbury quarter
moreover the weatherbury folk were by no means uninteresting intrinsically
if report spoke truly they were as hardy merry thriving wicked a set as any in the whole county
oak resolved to sleep at weatherbury  that  night on his way to shottsford and struck out at once  into the  high road which had been recommended as the direct route to the village in question
the road stretched through watermeadows traversed by little brooks whose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres and folded into creases at the sides or where the flow was more rapid the stream was pied with spots of white froth which rode on in undisturbed serenity
on the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter skelter upon the shoulders of the wind and little birds in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking themselves in comfortably for the night retaining their places if oak kept moving but flying away if he stopped to look at them
he passed by yalburywood where the gamebirds were rising to their roosts and heard the crackvoiced cockpheasants cuuck cuck and the wheezy whistle of the hens
by the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in thelandscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness
he descended yalbury hill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon drawn up under a great overhanging tree by the roadside
on coming close he found there were no horses attached to it the spot being apparently quite deserted
the waggon from its position seemed to have been left there for the night for beyond about half a truss  of hay which was heaped in the bottom it was quite empty
gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and con sidered his position
he calculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey and having been on foot since daybreak he felt tempted to lie down upon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the village of weatherbury and having to pay for a lodging
eating his las slices of bread and ham and drinking from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him he got into the lonely waggon
here he spread half of the hay as a bed and as well as he could in the darkness pulled the other half over him by way of bedclothes covering himself entirely and feeling physically as comfortable as ever he had been in his life
inward melancholy it was impossible for a man like oak introspective far beyond his neighbours to banish quite whilst conning the present
untoward page of his history
so thinking of his misfortunes amorous and pastoral he fell asleep shepherds enjoying in common with sailors the privilege of being able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him
on somewhat suddenly awaking after a sleep of whose length he had no idea oak found that the waggon was in motion
he was being carried along the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without springs and under circumstances of physical uneasiness his head being dandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrumstick
he then dis tinguished voices in conversation coming from the forpart of the waggon
his concern at this dilemma which would have been alarm had he been a thriving man but  misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror led him to peer cautiously from the hay and the first sight he beheld was the stars above him
charles's wain was getting towards a right angle with the pole star and gabriel concluded that it must be about nine o'clock  in other words that he had slept two hours
this small astronomical calculation was made without any positive effort and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover if possible into whose hands he had fallen
two figures were dimly visible in front sitting with their legs outside the waggon one of whom was driving
gabriel soon found that this was the waggoner and it appeared they had come from casterbridge fair like himself
a conversation was in progress which continued thus   be as 'twill she's a fine handsome body as far's looks be concerned
but that's only the skin of the woman and these dandy cattle be asproud as a lucifer in their insides
ay  so 'a do seem billy smallbury  so 'a do seem
this utterance was very shaky by nature and more so by circumstance the jolting of the waggon not being without its effect upon the speaker's larynx
it came from the man who held the reins
she's a very vain feymell  so 'tis said here and there
ah now
if so be 'tis like that i can't look her in the face
lord no  not i  hehhehheh
such a shy man as i be
yes  she's very vain
'tis said that every night at going to bed she looks in the glass to put on her night cap properly
and not a married woman
oh the world
and 'a can play the peanner so 'tis said
can play so clever that 'a can make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a man can wish for
d'ye tell o't
a happy time for us and i feel quite a new man
and how do she play
that i don't know master poorgrass
on hearing these and other similar remarks a wild thought flashed into gabriel's mind that they might be speaking of bathsheba
there were however no ground for retaining such a supposition for the waggon though going in the direction of weatherbury might be going beyond it and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate
they were now apparently close upon weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers unnecessarily gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen
he turned to an opening in the hedge which he found to be a gate and mounting thereon he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in the village or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or cornstack
the crunching jangle of the waggon died upon his ear
he was about to walk on when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light  appearing about half a mile distant
oak watched it and the glow increased
something was on fire
gabriel again mounted the gate and leaping down on the other side upon what he found to be ploughed soil made across the field in the exact direction of the fire
the blaze enlarging in a  double ratio by his approach and its own increase showed him as he drew nearer the outlines of ricks beside it lighted up to great distinctness
a rickyard was the source of the fire
his weary face now began to be painted over with a rich orange glow and the whole front of his smock frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of thorntwigs  the light reaching him through a leafless intervening hedge  and the metallic curve of his sheepcrook shone silverbright in the same abound ing rays
he came up to the boundary fence and stood to regain breath
it seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living soul
the fire was issuing from a long strawstack which was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it
a rick burns differently from a house
as the wind blows the fire inwards the portion in flames completely disappears like melting sugar and the outline is lost to the eye
however a hay or a wheatrick well put together will resist combustion for a length of time if it begins on the outside
this before gabriel's eyes was a rick of straw loosely put together and the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness
it glowed on the windward side rising and falling in intensity like the coal of a cigar
then a superincumbent bundle rolled down with a whisking noise flames elongated and bent themselves about with a quiet roar but no crackle
banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds and behind these burned hidden pyres illuminating the semitransparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity
individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat as if they were knots of red worms and above shone imaginary fiery faces tongues hanging from lips glaring eyes and other impish forms from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case to be more serious than he had at first imagined
a scroll of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheatrick in startling juxtaposition with the decaying one and behind this a series of others composing the main corn produce of the farm so that instead of the strawstack standing as he had imagined comparatively isolated there was a regular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group
gabriel leapt over the hedge and saw that he was not alone
the first man he came to was running about in a great hurry as if his thoughts were several yards in advance of his body which they could never drag on fast enough
o man  fire fire
a good master and a bad servant is fire fire
 i mane a bad servant and a good master o mark clark  come
and you billy smallbury  and you maryann money  and you jan coggan and matthew there
other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among the smoke and gabriel found that far from being alone he was in a great company  whose shadows danced merrily up and down timed by the jigging of the flames and not at all by their owners' movements
the assemblage  belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling and its feelings into the form of commotion  set to work with a remarkable confusion of purpose
stop the draught under the wheatrick
cried gabriel to those nearest to him
the corn stood on stone staddles and between these tongues of yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully
if the fire once got under this stack all would be lost
get a tarpaulin  quick
said gabriel
a rickcloth was brought and they hung it like a curtain across the channel
the flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the cornstack and stood up vertical
stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet
said gabriel again
the flames now driven upwards began to attack the angles of the huge roof covering the wheatstack
a ladder
cried gabriel
the ladder was against the strawrick and is burnt to a cinder
said a spectrelike form in the smoke
oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves as if he were going to engage in the operation of reeddrawing and digging in his feet and occasionally sticking in the stem of his sheepcrook he clambered up the beetling face
he at once sat astride the very apex and began with his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon shouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder and some water
billy smallbury  one of the men who had been on the waggon  by this time had found a ladder which mark clark ascended holding on beside oak upon the thatch
the smoke at this corner was stifling and clark a nimble fellow having been handed a bucket of water bathed oak's face and sprinkled him generally whilst gabriel now with a long beechbough in one hand in addition to his crook in the other kept sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles
on the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all they could to keep down the conflagration which was not much
they were all tinged orange and backed up by shadows of varying pattern
round the corner of the largest stack out of the direct rays of the fire stood a pony bearing a young woman on its back
by her side was another woman on foot
these two seemed to keep at a distance from the fire that the horse might not become restive
he's a shepherd
said the woman on foot
yes  he is
see how his crook shines as he beats the rick with it
and his smockfrock is burnt in two holes i declare
a fine young shepherd he is too ma'am
whose shepherd is he
said the equestrian in a clear voice
don't know ma'am
don't any of the others know
nobody at all  i've asked 'em
quite a stranger they say
the young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked anxiously around
do you think the barn is safe
she said
d'ye think the barn is safe jan coggan
said the second woman passing on the question to the nearest man in that direction
safe now  leastwise i think so
if this rick had gone the barn would have followed
'tis that bold shepherd up there that have done the most good  he sitting on the top o' rick whizzing his great longarms about like a windmill
he does work hard
said the young woman on horseback looking up at gabriel through her thick woollen veil
i wish he was shepherd here
don't any of you know his name
never heard the man's name in my life or seed his form afore
the fire began to get worsted and gabriel's elevated position being no longer required of him he made as if to descend
maryann
said the girl on horseback go to him as he comes down and say that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he has done
maryann stalked off towards the rick and met oak at the foot of the ladder
she delivered her message
where is your master the farmer
asked gabriel kindling with the idea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now
'tisn't a master 'tis a mistress shepherd
a woman farmer
ay 'a b'lieve and a rich one too
said a by stander
lately 'a came here from a distance
took on her uncle's farm who died suddenly
used to measure his money in halfpint cups
they say now that she've business in every bank in casterbridge and thinks no more of playing pitchandtoss sovereign than you and i do pitchhalfpenny  not a bit in the world shepherd
that's she back there upon the pony
said mary ann
wi' her face acovered up in that black cloth with holes in it
oak his features smudged grimy and undiscoverable from the smoke and heat his smockfrock burntinto holes and dripping with water the ash stem of his sheep crook charred six inches shorter advansed with the humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the slight female form in the saddle
he lifted his hat with respect and not without gallantry stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice  do you happen to want a shepherd ma'am
she lifted the wool veil tied round her face and looked all astonishment
gabriel and his coldhearted darling bathsheba everdene were face to face
bathsheba did not speak and he mechanically repeated in an abashed and sad voice  do you want a shepherd ma'am
chapter vii    recognition  a timid girl   bathsheba withdrew into the shade
she scarcely knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of the meeting or to be concerned at its awkwardness
there was room for a little pity also for a very little exultation  the former at his position the latter at her own
embarrassed she was not and she remembered gabriel's declaration of love to her at norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it
yes she murmured putting on an air of dignity and turning again to him with a little warmth of cheek i do want a shepherd
but     he's the very man ma'am
said one of the villagers quietly
conviction breeds conviction
ay that 'a is
said a second decisively
the man truly
said a third with heartiness
he's all there
said number four fervidly
then will you tell him to speak to the bailiff said bathsheba
all was practical again now
a summer eve and loneliness would have been necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance
the palpitation within his breast at discovering that this ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of venus the wellknown and admired retired with him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring
the fire before them wasted away
men
said bathsheba  you shall take a little refreshment after this extra work
will you come to the house
we could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal freer miss if so be ye'd send it to warren's malthouse replied the spokesman
bathsheba then rode off into the darkness and the men straggled on to the village in twos and threes  oak and the bailiff being left by the rick alone
and now
said the bailiff finally all is settled i think about your coming and i am going homealong
goodnight to ye shepherd
can you get me a lodging
inquired gabriel
that i can't indeed he said moving past oak as a christian edges past an offertoryplate when he does not mean to contribute
if you follow on the road till you come to warren's malthouse where they are all gone to have their snap of victuals i daresay some of 'em will tell you of a place
goodnight to ye shepherd
the bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as himself went up the hill and oak walked on to the village still astonished at the ren counter with bathsheba glad of his nearness to her and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here
but some women only require an emerg ency to make them fit for one
obliged to some extent to forgo dreaming in order to find the way he reached the churchyard and passed round it under the wall where several ancient trees grew
there was a wide margin of grass along here and gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness even at this indurating period of the year
when abreast of a trunk which appeared to be the oldest of the old he became aware that a figure was standing behind it
gabriel did not pause in his walk and in another moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone
the noise was enough to disturb the motionless stranger who started and assumed a careless position
it was a slim girl rather thinly clad
goodnight to you
said gabriel heartily
goodnight
said the girl to gabriel
the voice was unexpectedly attractive it was the low and dulcet note suggestive of romance common in descriptions rare in experience
i'll thank you to tell me if i'm in the way for warren's malthouse
gabriel resumed primarily to gain the information indirectly to get more of the music
quite right
it's at the bottom of the hill
and do you know    the girl hesitated and then went on again
do you know how late they keep open the buck's head inn
she seemed to be won by gabriel's heartiness as gabriel had been won by her modulations
i don't know where the buck's head is or anything about it
do you think of going there tonight
yes    the woman again paused
there was no necessity for any continuance of speech and the fact that she did add more seemed to proceed from an unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a remark which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they are acting by stealth
you are not a weatherbury man
she said timorously
i am not
i am the new shepherd  just arrived
only a shepherd  and you seem almost a farmer by your ways
only a shepherd
gabriel repeated in a dull cadence of finality
his thoughts were directed to the past his eyes to the feet of the girl and for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some sort
she may have perceived the direction of his face for she said coaxingly  you won't say anything in the parish about having seen me here will you  at least not for a day or two
i won't if you wish me not to
said oak
thank you indeed
the other replied
i am rather poor and i don't want people to know anything about me
then she was silent and shivered
you ought to have a cloak on such a cold night gabriel observed
i would advise 'ee to get indoors
o no
would you mind going on and leaving me
i thank you much for what you have told me
i will go on
he said adding hesitatingly  since you are not very well off perhaps you would accept this trifle from me
it is only a shilling but it is all i have to spare
yes i will take it
said the stranger gratefully
she extended her hand gabriel his
in feeling for each other's palm in the gloom before the money could be passed a minute incident occurred which told much
gabriel's fingers alighted on the young woman's wrist
it was beating with a throb of tragic intensity
he had frequently felt the same quick hard beat in the femoral artery of  his lambs when overdriven
it suggested a consumption too great of a vitality which to judge from her figure and stature was already too little
what is the matter
nothing
but there is
no no no
let your having seen me be a secret
very well i will
goodnight again
goodnight
the young girl remained motionless by the tree and gabriel descended into the village of weatherbury or lower longpuddle as it was sometimes called
he fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile creature
but wisdom lies in moderating mere impres sions and gabriel endeavoured to think little of this
chapter viii    the malthouse  the chat  news   warren's malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy and though not much of the exterior was visible at this hour the character and purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline upon the sky
from the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to a point in the centre upon which rose a small wooden lantern fitted with louvreboards on all the four sides and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping into the night air
there was no window in front but a square hole in the door was glazed with a single pane through which red comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front
voices were to be heard inside
oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an elymasthesomerer pattern till he found a leathern strap which he pulled
this lifted a wooden latch and the door swung open
the room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln mouth which shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality of the setting sun and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those assembled around
the stoneflag floor was worn into a path from the doorway to the kiln and into undula tions everywhere
a curved settle of unplaned oak stretched along one side and in a remote corner was a small bed and bedstead the owner and frequent occupier of which was the maltster
this aged man was now sitting opposite the fire his frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless appletree
he wore breeches and the lacedup shoes called anklejacks he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire
gabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell of new malt
the conversation which seemed to have been concerning the origin of the fire immediately ceased and every one ocularly criticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eye lids as if he had been a light too strong for their sight
several exclaimed meditatively after this operation had been completed   oh 'tis the new shepherd 'a b'lieve
we thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin but weren't sure 'twere not a dead leaf blowed across
said another
come in shepherd sure ye be welcome though we don't know yer name
gabriel oak that's my name neighbours
the ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up this  his turning being as the turning of a rusty crane
that's never gable oak's grandson over at nor combe  never
he said as a formula expressive of surprise which nobody was supposed to take literally'
my father and my grandfather were old men of the name of gabriel
said the shepherd placidly
thought i knowed the man's face as i seed him on the rick
 thought i did
and where be ye trading o't to now shepherd
i'm thinking of biding here
said mr oak
knowed yer grandfather for years and years
continued the maltster the words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum previously imparted had been sufficient
ah  and did you
knowed yer grandmother
and her too
likewise knowed yer father when he was a child
why my boy jacob there and your father were sworn brothers  that they were sure  weren't ye jacob
ay sure
said his son a young man about sixty five with a semibald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw which made much of itself by standing prominent like a milestone in a bank
but twas joe had most to do with him
however my son william must have knowed the very man afore us  didn't ye billy afore ye left norcombe
no 'twas andrew
said jacob's son billy a child of forty or thereabouts who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here and there
i can mind andrew
said oak as being a man in the place when i was quite a child
ay  the other day i and my youngest daughter liddy were over at my grandson's christening
continued billy
we were talking about this very family and twas only last purification day in this very world when the usemoney is gied away to the secondbest poor folk you know shepherd and i can mind the day because they all had to traypse up to the vestry  yes this very man's family
come shepherd and drink
'tis gape and swaller with us  a drap of sommit but not of much account
said the maltster removing from the fire his eyes which were vermilionred and bleared by gazing into it for so many years
take up the godforgive me jacob
see if 'tis warm jacob
jacob stooped to the godforgiveme which was a twohandled tall mug standing in the ashes cracked and charred with heat  it was rather furred with ex traneous matter about the outside especially in the crevices of the handles the innermost curves of which may not have seen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation thereon  formed of ashes accident ally wetted with cider and baked hard but to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that being incontestably clean on the inside and about the rim
it may be observed that such a class of mug is called a godforgiveme in weatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons probably because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees its bottom in drinking it empty
jacob on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough placidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer and having pronounced it nearly of the proper degree raised the cup and very civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with the skirt of his smockfrock because shepherd oak was a stranger
a clane cup for the shepherd
said the maltster commandingly
no  not at all said gabriel in a reproving tone of considerateness
i never fuss about dirt in its pure state and when i know what sort it is
taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its contents and duly passed it to the next man
wouldn't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there's so much work to be done in the world already
continued oak in a moister tone after recovering from the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by pulls at large mugs
a right sensible man
said jacob
true true it can't be gainsaid
observed a brisk young man  mark clark by name a genial and pleasant gentleman whom to meet anywhere in your travels was to know to know was to drink with and to drink with was unfortunately to pay for
and here's a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis'ess have sent shepherd
the cider will go down better with a bit of victuals
don't ye chaw quite close shepherd for i let the bacon fall in the road outside as i was bringing it along and may be 'tis rather gritty
there 'tis clane dirt and we all know what that is as you say and you bain't a particular man we see shepherd
true true  not at all
said the friendly oak
don't let your teeth quite meet and you won't feel the sandiness at all
ah
'tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance
my own mind exactly neighbour
ah he's his grandfer's own grandson
 his grandfer were just such a nice unparticular man
said the maltster
drink henry fray  drink
magnanimously said jan coggan a person who held saintsimonian notions of share and share alike where liquor was concerned as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual revolution among them
having at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into midair henry did not refuse
he was a man of more than middle age with eyebrows high up in his forehead who laid it down that the law of the world was bad with a longsuffering look through his listeners at the world alluded to as it presented itself to his imagination
he always signed his name henery  strenuously insisting upon that spelling and if any passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second e was superfluous and oldfashioned he received the reply that  henery was the name he was christened and the name he would stick to  in the tone of one to whom orthographical differences were matters which had a great deal to do with personal character
mr jan coggan who had passed the cup to henery was a crimson man with a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye whose name had appeared on the marriage register of weatherbury and neighbour ing parishes as best man and chief witness in countless unions of the previous twenty years he also very frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms of the subtlyjovial kind
come mark clark  come
ther's plenty more in the barrel
said jan ay  that i will 'tis my only doctor
replied mr clark who twenty years younger than jan coggan revolved in the same orbit
he secreted mirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular parties
why joseph poorgrass ye han't had a drop
said mr coggan to a selfconscious man in the background thrusting the cup towards him
such a modest man as he is
said jacob smallbury
why ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look in our young mis'ess's face so i hear joseph
all looked at joseph poorgrass with pitying reproach
no  i've hardly looked at her at all
simpered joseph reducing his body smaller whilst talking apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence
and when i seed her 'twas nothing but blushes with me
poor feller
said mr clark
'tis a curious nature for a man
said jan coggan
yes
continued joseph poorgrass  his shyness which was so painful as a defect filling him with a mild complacency now that it was regarded as an interesting study
'twere blush blush blush with me every minute of the time when she was speaking to me
i believe ye joseph poorgrass for we all know ye to be a very bashful man
'tis a' awkward gift for a man poor soul
said the maltster
and ye have suffered from it a long time we know
ay ever since i was a boy
yes  mother was concerned to her heart about it  yes
but twas all nought
did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it joseph poorgrass
oh ay tried all sorts o' company
they took me to greenhill fair and into a great gay jerrygonimble show where there were womenfolk riding round  standing upon horses with hardly anything on but their smocks but it didn't cure me a morsel
and then i was put errandman at the women's skittle alley at the back of the tailor's arms in casterbridge
'twas a horrible sinful situation and a very curious place for a good man
i had to stand and look ba'dy people in the face from morning till night but 'twas no use  i was just asbad as ever after all
blushes hev been in the family for generations
there 'tis a happy pro vidence that i be no worse
true
said jacob smallbury deepening his thoughts to a profounder view of the subject
'tis a thought to look at that ye might have been worse but even as you be 'tis a very bad affliction for 'ee joseph
for ye see shepherd though 'tis very well for a woman dang it all 'tis awkward for a man like him poor feller
'tis  'tis
said gabriel recovering from a medita tion
yes very awkward for the man
ay and he's very timid too
observed jan coggan
once he had been working late at yalbury bottom and had had a drap of drink and lost his way as he was coming homealong through yalbury wood didn't ye master poorgrass
no no no not that story
expostulated the modest man forcing a laugh to bury his concern 
    and so 'a lost himself quite
continued mr coggan with an impassive face implying that a true narrative like time and tide must run its course and would respect no man
and as he was coming along in the middle of the night much afeared and not able to find his way out of the trees nohow 'a cried out manalost
manalost
a owl in a tree happened to be crying whoowhoowhoo
as owls do you know shepherd gabriel nodded  and joseph all in a tremble said  joseph poorgrass of weatherbury sir
no no now  that's too much
said the timid man becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden
i didn't say sir
i'll tike my oath i didn't say  joseph poorgrass o' weatherbury sir
no no what's right is right and i never said sir to the bird knowing very well that no man of a gentleman's rank would be hollering there at that time o' night
joseph poor grass of weatherbury   that's every word i said and i shouldn't ha' said that if 't hadn't been for keeper day's metheglin
there 'twas a merciful thing it ended where it did
the question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company jan went on meditatively   and he's the fearfullest man bain't ye joseph
ay another time ye were lost by lambingdown gate weren't ye joseph
i was
replied poorgrass as if there were some conditions too serious even for modesty to remember itself under this being one
yes that were the middle of the night too
the gate would not open try how he would and knowing there was the devil's hand in it he kneeled down
ay
said joseph acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire the cider and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to
my heart died within me that time but i kneeled down and said the lord's prayer and then the belie right through and then the ten commandments in earnest prayer
but no the gate wouldn't open and then i went on with dearly beloved brethren and thinks i this makes four and 'tis all i know out of book and if this don't do it nothing will and i'm a lost man
well when i got to saying after me i rose from my knees and found the gate would open   yes neighbours the gate opened the same as ever
a meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all and during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun shaping their eyes long and liny partly because of the light partly from the depth of the subject discussed
gabriel broke the silence
what sort of a place is this to live at and what sort of a mis'ess is she to work under
gabriel's bosom thrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner most subject of his heart
we d' know little of her  nothing
she only showed herself a few days ago
her uncle was took bad and the doctor was called with his worldwide skill but he couldn't save the man
as i take it she's going to keep on the farm
that's about the shape o't 'a b'lieve
said jan uncle was a very fair sort of man
did ye know en be under 'em as under one here and there
her uncle was a very fair sort of man
did ye know 'en shepherd  a bachelorman
not at all
i used to go to his house acourting my first wife charlotte who was his dairymaid
well a very good hearted man were farmer everdene and i being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see her and drink as much ale as i liked but not to carry away any  outside my skin i mane of course
ay ay jan coggan we know yer meaning
and so you see 'twas beautiful ale and i wished to value his kindness as much as i could and not to be so illmannered as to drink only a thimbleful which would have been insulting the man's generosity        true master coggan 'twould so
corroborated mark clark   
   and so i used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going and then by the time i got there i were as dry as a limebasket  so thorough dry that that ale would slip down   ah 'twould slip down sweet
happy times
heavenly times
such lovely drunks as i used to have at that house
you can mind jacob
you used to go wi' me sometimes
i can  i can
said jacob
that one too that we had at buck's head on a white monday was a pretty tipple
'twas
but for a wet of the better class that brought you no nearer to the horned man than you were afore you begun there was none like those in farmer everdene's kitchen
not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great relief to a merry soul
true
said the maltster
nater requires her swearing at the regular times or she's not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life
but charlotte
continued coggan  not a word of the sort would charlotte allow nor the smallest item of taking in vain ay poor charlotte i wonder if she had the good fortune to get into heaven when 'a died
but 'a was never much in luck's way and perhaps 'a went downwards after all poor soul
and did any of you know miss everdene'sfather and mother
inquired the shepherd who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired channel
i knew them a little
said jacob smallbury but they were townsfolk and didn't live here
they've been dead for years
father what sort of people were mis'ess' father and mother
well
said the maltster he wasn't much to look at but she was a lovely woman
he was fond enough of her as his sweetheart
used to kiss her scores and longhundreds o times so 'twas said
observed coggan
he was very proud of her too when they were married as i've been told
said the maltster
ay
said coggan
he admired her so much that he used to light the candle three time a night to look at her
boundless love i shouldn't have supposed it in the universe
murmered joseph poorgrass who habitually spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections
well to be sure
said gabriel
oh 'tis true enough
i knowed the man and woman both well
levi everdene  that was the man's name sure
man
saith i in my hurry but he were of a higher circle of life than that  'a was a gentleman tailor really worth scores of pounds
and he became a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times
oh i thought he was quite a common man
said joseph
o no no
that man failed for heaps of money hundreds in gold and silver
the maltster being rather short of breath mr coggan after absently scrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes took up the narrative with a private twirl of his eye    well now you'd hardly believe it but that man  husbands alive after a while
understand
'a didn't want to be fickle but he couldn't help it
the poor feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish but his heart would rove do what he would
he spoke to me in real tribulation about it once
coggan he said i could never wish for a handsomer woman than i've got but feeling she's ticketed as my lawful wife i can't help my wicked heart wandering do what i will
but at last i believe he cured it by making her take off her weddingring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together after the shop was shut and so 'a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart and not married to him at all
and as soon as he could thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and committing the seventh 'a got to like her as well as ever and they lived on a perfect picture of mutel love
well 'twas a most ungodly remedy
murmured joseph poorgrass but we ought to feel deep cheerful ness that a happy providence kept it from being any worse
you see he might have gone the bad road and given his eyes to unlawfulness entirely  yes gross un lawfulness so to say it
you see
said billy smallbury the man's will was to do right sure enough but his heart didn't chime in
he got so much better that he was quite godly in his later years wasn't he jan
said joseph poor grass
he got himself confirmed over again in a more serious way and took to saying amen almost as loud as the clerk and he liked to copy comforting verses from the tombstones
he used too to hold the money plate at let your light so shine and stand godfather to poor little comebychance children and he kept a missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares when they called yes and he wouldbox the charity boys' ears if they laughed in church till they could hardly stand upright and do other deeds of piety natural to the saintly inclined
ay at that time he thought of nothing but high things
added billy smallbury
one day parson thirdly met him and said goodmorning mister everdene 'tis a fine day
amen said everdene quite absent like thinking only of religion when he seed a parson   their daughter was not at all a pretty chile at that time
said henery fray
never should have
thought she'd have growed up such a handsome body as she is
'tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face
well yes but the baily will have most to do with the business and ourselves
ah
henery gazed into the ashpit and smiled volumes of ironical knowledge
a queer christian like the devil's head in a cowl   he is
said henery implying that irony must cease at a certain point
between we two man and man i believe that man would as soon tell a lie sundays as workingdays  that i do so
good faith you do talk
said gabriel
true enough
said the man of bitter moods looking round upon the company with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of
'ah there's people of one sort and people of another but that man   bless your souls
gabriel thought fit to change the subject
you must be a very aged man malter to have sons growed mild and ancient he remarked
father's so old that 'a can't mind his age can ye father
interposed jacob
and he growled terrible crooked too lately jacob continued surveying his father's figure which was rather more bowed than his own
really one may say that father there is threedouble
crooked folk will last a long while
said the maltster grimly and not in the best humour
shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life father  wouldn't ye shepherd
ay that i should
said gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had longed to hear it for several months
what may your age be malter
the maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis and elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit
said in the slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so generally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it well i don't mind the year i were born in but perhaps i can reckon up the places i've lived at and so get it that way
i bode at upper long puddle across there nodding to the north till i were eleven
i bode seven at kingsbere nodding to the east where i took to malting
i went therefrom to norcombe and malted there twoandtwenty years and twoandtwenty years i was there turniphoeing and harvesting
ah i knowed that old place norcombe years afore you were thought of master oak oak smiled sincere belief in the fact
then i malted at dur nover four year and four year turniphoeing and i was fourteen times eleven months at millpond st jude's nodding northwestbynorth
old twills wouldn't hire me for more than eleven months at a time to keep me from being chargeable to the parish if so be i was disabled
then i was three year at mellstock and i've been here oneandthirty year come candlemas
how much is that
hundred and seventeen
chuckled another old gentleman given to mental arithmetic and little con versation who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner
well then that's my age
said the maltster em phatically
o no father
said jacob
your turniphoeing were in the summer and your malting in the winter of the same years and ye don't ought to countboth halves father
chok' it all
i lived through the summers didn't i
that's my question
i suppose ye'll say next i be no age at all to speak of
sure we shan't
said gabriel soothingly
ye be a very old aged person malter
attested jan must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able to live so long mustn't he neighbours
true true ye must malter wonderful said the meeting unanimously
the maltster being know pacified was even generous enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a great many years by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out of was three years older than he
while the cup was being examined the end of gabriel oak's flute became visible over his smockfrock i seed you blowing into a great flute by now at caster bridge
you did
said gabriel blushing faintly
i've been in great trouble neighbours and was driven to it
take it carelesslike shepherd and your time will come tired
neither drum nor trumpet have i heard since christmas
said jan coggan
come raise a tune master oak
that i will
said gabriel pulling out his flute and putting it together
a poor tool neighbours but such as i can do ye shall have and welcome
oak then struck up jockey to the fair
and played that sparkling melody three times through accenting the notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping with his foot to beat time
he can blow the flute very well  that 'a can
said a young married man who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as susan tall's husband
he continued i'd as lief as not be able to blow into a flute as wellas that
he's a clever man and 'tis a true comfort for us to have such a shepherd
murmured joseph poorgrass in a soft cadence
we ought to feel full o' thanksgiving that he's not a player of ba'dy songs 'instead of these merry tunes for 'twould have been just as easy for god to have made the shepherd a loose low man  a man of iniquity so to speak it  as what he is
yes for our wives and daughters' sakes we should feel real thanks giving
true true  real thanksgiving
dashed in mark clark conclusively not feeling it to be of any conse quence to his opinion that he had only heard about a word and threequarters of what joseph had said
yes
added joseph beginning to feel like a man in the bible for evil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the cleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the turnpike if i may term it so
ay i can mind yer face now shepherd
said henery fray criticising gabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second tune
yes  now i see 'ee blowing into the flute i know 'ee to be the same man i see play at casterbridge for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes astaring out like a strangled man's  just as they be now
'tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a scarecrow
observed mr mark clark with additional criticism of gabriel's countenance the latter person jerking out with the ghastly grimace required by the instrument the chorus of dame durden
i hope you don't mind that young man's bad manners in naming your features
whispered joseph to gabriel
not at all
said mr oak
for by nature ye be a very handsome man shepherd
continued joseph poorgrass with winning sauvity
ay that ye be shepard
said the company
thank you very much
said oak in the modest tone good manners demanded thinking however that he would never let bathsheba see him playing the flute in this severe showing a discretion equal to that related to its sagacious inventress the divine minerva herself
ah when i and my wife were married at norcombe church
said the old maltster not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood  everybody said so
danged if ye bain't altered now malter
said a voice with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark ably evident truism
it came from the old man in the background whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he con tributed to general laughs
o no no
said gabriel
don't ye play no more shepherd said susan tall's husband the young married man who had spoken once before
i must be moving and when there's tunes going on i seem as if hung in wires
if i thought after i'd left that music was still playing and i not there i should be quite melancholylike
what's yer hurry then laban
inquired coggan
you used to bide as late as the latest
well ye see neighbours i was lately married to a woman and she's my vocation now and so ye see     the young man hated lamely
new lords new laws as the saying is i suppose remarked coggan
ay 'a b'lieve  ha ha
said susan tall's husband in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all
the young man then wished them goodnight and withdrew
henery fray was the first to follow
then gabriel arose and went off with jan coggan who had offered him a lodging
a few minutes later when the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart fray came back again in a hurry
flourishing his finger ominously he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just  where his eye alighted by accident which happened to be in joseph poorgrass's face
o  what's the matter what's the matter henery
said joseph starting back
what's abrewing henrey
asked jacob and mark clark
baily pennyways  baily pennyways  i said so yes i said so
what found out stealing anything
stealing it is
the news is that after miss everdene got home she went out again to see all was safe as she usually do and coming in found baily pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a a bushel of barley
she fleed at him  like a cat  never such a tomboy as she is  of course i speak with closed doors
you do  you do henery
she fleed at him and to cut a long story short he owned to having carried off five sack altogether upon her promising not to persecute him
well he's turned out neck and crop and my question is who's going to be baily now
the question was such a profound one that henery was obliged to drink there and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside
before he had replaced it on the table in came the young man susan tall's husband in a still greater hurry
have ye heard the news that's all over parish
about baily pennyways
but besides that
no  not a morsel of it
they replied looking into the very midst of laban tall as if to meet his words halfway down his throat
what a night of horrors
murmured joseph poor grass waving his hands spasmodically
i've had the newsbell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a murder and i've seen a magpie all alone
fanny robin  miss everdene's youngest servant  can't be found
they've been wanting to lock up the door these two hours but she isn't come in
and they don't know what to do about going to hed for fear of locking her out
they wouldn't be so concerned if she hadn't been noticed in such low spirits these last few days and maryann d'think the beginning of a crowner's inquest has happened to the poor girl
o  'tis burned  'tis burned
came from joseph poorgrass's dry lips
no  'tis drowned
said tall
or 'tis her father's razor
suggested billy smallbury with a vivid sense of detail
well  miss everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go to bed
what with this trouble about the baily and now about the girl mis'ess is almost wild
they all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse excepting the old maltster whom neither news fire rain nor thunder could draw from his hole
there as the others' footsteps died away he sat down again and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red bleared eyes
from the bedroom window above their heads bath sheba's head and shoulders robed in mystic white were dimly seen extended into the air
are any of my men among you
she said anxiously
yes ma'am several
said susan tall's husband
tomorrow morning i wish two or three of you to make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen such a person as fanny robin
do it quietly there is no reason for alarm as yet
she must have left whilst we were all at the fire
i beg yer pardon but had she any young man court ing her in the parish ma'am
asked jacob smallbury
i don't know
said bathsheba
i've never heard of any such thing ma'am
said two or three
it is hardly likely either
continued bathsheba
for any lover of hers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad
the most mysterious matter connected with her absence  indeed the only thing which gives me serious alarm  is that she was seen to go out of the house by maryann with only her indoor working gown on  not even a bonnet
and you mean ma'am excusing my words that a young woman would hardly go to see her young man without dressing up
said jacob turning his mental vision upon past experiences
that's true  she would not ma'am
she had i think a bundle though i couldn't see very well
said a female voice from another window which seemed that of maryann
but she had no young man about here
hers lives in casterbridge and i believe he's a soldier
do you know his name
bathsheba said
no mistress she was very close about it
perhaps i might be able to find out if i went to casterbridge barracks
said william smallbury
very well if she doesn't return tomorrow mind you go there and try to discover which man it is and see him
i feel more responsible than i should if she had had any friends or relations alive
i do hope she has come to no harm through a man of that kind and then there's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff  but i can't speak of him now
bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one
do as i told you then she said in conclusion closing the casement
ay ay mistress we will
they replied and moved away
that night at coggan's gabriel oak beneath the screen of closed eyelids was busy with fancies and full of movement like a river flowing rapidly under its ice
night had always been the time at which he saw bath sheba most vividly and through the slow hours of shadow he tenderly regarded her image now
it is rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compen sate for the pain of sleeplessness but they possibly did with oak tonight for the delight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his perception of the great differ ence between seeing and possessing
he also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from norcombe
the young man's best companion the farrier's sure guide the veterinary surgeon paradise lost the pilgrim's progress robinson crusoe ash's dictionary the walkingame's arithmetic constituted his library and though a limited series it was one from which he had acquired more sound informa tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities has done from a furlong of laden shelves
chapter ix    the homestead  a visitor  halfconfidences   by daylight the bower of oak's newfound mistress bathsheba everdene presented itself as a hoary build ing of the early stage of classic renaissance as regards its architecture and of 'a proportion which told at a glance that as is so frequently the case it had once been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it now altogether effaced as a distinct property and merged in the vast tract of a nonresident landlord which com prised several such modest demesnes
fluted pilasters worked from the solid stone decorated its front and above the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar some coped gables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their gothic extraction
soft brown mosses like faded velveteen formed cushions upon the stone tiling and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings
a gravel walk leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides with more moss  here it was a silvergreen variety the nutbrown of the gravel being visible to the width of only a foot or two in the centre
this circum stance and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect here together with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse facade suggested to the imagination that on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes the vital principle' of the house had turned round inside its body to face the other way
reversals of this kind strange deformities tremendous paralyses are often seen to be inflicted by trade upon edifices  either individual or in the aggregate as streets and towns  which were originally planned for pleasure alone
lively voices were heard this morning in the upper rooms the main staircase to which was of hard oak the balusters heavy as bedposts being turned and moulded in the quaint fashion of their century the handrail as stout as a parapettop and the stairs themselves con tinually twisting round like a person trying to look over his shoulder
going up the floors above were found to have a very irregular surface rising to ridges sinking into valley and being just then uncarpeted the face of the boards was seen to be eaten into innumerable the opening and shutting of every door a tremble followed every bustling movement and a creak accom panied a walker about the house like a spirit wherever he went
in the room from which the conversation proceeded bathsheba and her servantcompanion liddy small bury were to be discovered sitting upon the floor and sorting a complication of papers books bottles and rubbish spread out thereon  remnants from the house hold stores of the late occupier
liddy the maltster's greatgranddaughter was about bathsheba's equal in age and her face was a prominent advertisement of the features' might have lacked in form was amply made up for by perfection  of hue which at this wintertime was the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity and like the presentations of those great colourists it was a face which kept well back from the boundary between comeliness and the ideal
though elastic in nature she was less daring than bathsheba and occa sionally showed some earnestness which consisted half of genuine feeling and half of mannerliness superadded by way of duty
through a partlyopened door the noise of a scrubbing brush led up to the charwoman maryann money a person who for a face had a circular disc furrowed less by age than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects
to think of her was to get goodhumoured to speak of her was to raise the image of a dried normandy pippin
stop your scrubbing a moment
said bathsheba through the door to her
i hear something
maryann suspended the brush
the tramp of a horse was apparent approaching the front of the building
the paces slackened turned in at the wicket and what was most unusual came up the mossy path close to the door
the door was tapped with the end of a crop or stick
what impertinence
said liddy in a low voice
to ride up the footpath like that
why didn't he stop at the gate
lord
'tis a gentleman
i see the top of his hat
be quiet
said bathsheba
the further expression of liddy's concern was con tinued by aspect instead of narrative
why doesn't mrs coggan go to the door
bath sheba continued
rattattattat resounded more decisively from bath sheba's oak
maryann you go
said she fluttering under the onset of a crowd of romantic possibilities
o ma'am  see here's a mess
the argument was unanswerable after a glance at maryann
liddy  you must
said bathsheba
liddy held up her hands and arms coated with dust from the rubbish they were sorting and looked implor ingly at her mistress
there  mrs coggan is going
said bathsheba exhaling her relief in the form of a long breath which had lain in her bosom a minute or more
the door opened and a deep voice said    is miss everdene at home
i'll see sir
said mrs coggan and in a minute appeared in the room
dear what a thirtover place this world is
con tinued mrs coggan a wholesomelooking lady who had a voice for each class of remark according to the emotion involved who could toss a pancake or twirl a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics and who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour
i am never up to my elbows miss in making a pudding but one of two things do happen  either my nose must needs begin tickling and i can't live without scratching   a woman's dress being a part of her countenance and any disorder in the one being of the same nature with a malformation or wound in the other bathsheba said at once    i can't see him in this state
whatever shall i do
notathomes were hardly naturalized in weatherbury farmhouses so liddy suggested  say you're a fright with dust and can't come down
yes  that sounds very well
said mrs coggan critically
say i can't see him  that will do
mrs coggan went downstairs and returned the answer as requested adding however on her own responsibility miss is dusting bottles sir and is quite a object  that's why 'tis
oh very well
said the deep voice
indifferently
all i wanted to ask was if anything had been heard of fanny robin
nothing sir  but we may know tonight
william smallbury is gone to casterbridge where her young man lives as is supposed and the other men be inquir ing about everywhere
the horse's tramp then recommenced and retreated and the door closed
who is mr
boldwood
said bathsheba
a gentlemanfarmer at little weatherbury
married
no miss
how old is he
forty i should say  very handsome  rather stern looking  and rich
what a bother this dusting is
i am always in some unfortunate plight or other bathsheba said complainingly
why should he inquire about fanny
oh because as she had no friends in her childhood he took her and put her to school and got her her place here under your uncle
he's a very kind man that way but lord  there
what
never was such a hopeless man for a woman
he's been courted by sixes and sevens  all the girls gentle and simple for miles round have tried him
jane perkins worked at him for two months like a slave and the two miss taylors spent a year upon him and he cost farmer ives's daughter nights of tears and twenty pounds' worth of new clothes but lord  the money might as well have been thrown out of the window
a little boy came up at this moment and looked in upon them
this child was one of the coggans who with the smallburys were as common among the families of this district as the avons and derwents among our rivers
he always had a loosened tooth or a cut finger to show to particular friends which he did with an air of being thereby elevated above the common herd of afflictionless humanity  to which exhibition of congratulation as well as pity
i've got a pennee
said master coggan in a scanning measure
well  who gave it you teddy
said liddy
misterr boldwood
he gave it to me for opening the gate
what did he say
he said where are you going my little man'
and i said to miss everdene's please and he said she is a staid woman isn't she my little man
and i said yes
you naughty child
what did you say that for
cause he gave me the penny
what a pucker everything is in
said bathsheba discontentedly when the child had gone
'get away thing
you ought to be married by this time and not here troubling me
ay mistress  so i did
but what between the poor men i won't have and the rich men who won't have me i stand as a pelicon in the wilderness
did anybody ever want to marry you miss
liddy ventured to ask when they were again alone
lots of em i daresay
bathsheba paused as if about to refuse a reply but the temptation to say yes since it was really in her power was irresistible by aspiring virginity in spite of her spleen at having been published as old
a man wanted to once
she said in a highly experi enced tone and the image of gabriel oak as the farmer rose before her
how nice it must seem
said liddy with the fixed features of mental realization
and you wouldn't have him
he wasn't quite good enough for me
how sweet to be able to disdain when most of us are glad to say thank you
i seem i hear it
no sir  i'm your better
or kiss my foot sir my face is for mouths of consequence
and did you love him miss
oh no
but i rather liked him
do you now
of course not  what footsteps are those i hear
liddy looked from a back window into the courtyard behind which was now getting lowtoned and dim with the earliest films of night
a crooked file of men was approaching the back door
the whole string of trailing individuals advanced in the completest balance of inten tion like the remarkable creatures known as chain salpae which distinctly organized in other respects have one will common to a whole family
some were as usual in snowwhite smockfrocks of russia duck and some in whiteybrown ones of drabbet  marked on the wrists breasts backs and sleeves with honeycombwork
two or three women in pattens brought up the rear
the philistines be upon us
said liddy making her nose white against the glass
oh very well
maryann go down and keep them in the kitchen till i am dressed and then show them in to me in the hall
chapter x    halfanhour later bathsheba in finished dress   and followed by liddy entered the upper end of the old hall to find that her men had all deposited themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower extremity
she sat down at a table and opened the timebook pen in her hand with a canvas moneybag beside her
from this she poured a small heap of coin
liddy chose a position at her elbow and began to sew sometimes pausing and looking round or with the air of a privileged person taking up one of the halfsovereigns lying before her and surveying it merely as a work of art while strictly preventing her countenance from expressing any wish to possess it as money
now before i begin men
said bathsheba i have two matters to speak of
the first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving and that i have formed a resolu tion to have no bailiff at all but to manage everything with my own head and hands
the men breathed an audible breath of amazement
the next matter is have you heard anything of fanny
nothing ma'am
have you done anything
i met farmer boldwood
said jacob smallbury 'and i went with him and two of his men and dragged new mill pond but we found nothing
and the new shepherd have been to buck's head by yalbury thinking she had gone there but nobody had seed her
said laban tall
hasn't william smallbury been to casterbridge
yes ma'am but he's not yet come home
he promised to be back by six
it wants a quarter to six at present
said bathsheba looking at her watch
i daresay he'll be in directly
well now then  she looked into the book  joseph poorgrass are you there
yes sir  ma'am i mane
said the person addressed
i be the personal name of poorgrass
and what are you
nothing in my own eye
in the eye of other people   well i don't say it though public thought will out
what do you do on the farm
i do do carting things all the year and in seed time i shoots the rooks and sparrows and helps at pigkilling sir
how much to you
please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where 'twas a bad one sir  ma'am i mane
quite correct
now here are ten shillings in addi tion as a small present as i am a new comer
bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being generous in public and henery fray who had drawn up towards her chair lifted his eyebrows and fingers to express amazement on a small scale
how much do i owe you  that man in the corner  what's your name
continued bathsheba
matthew moon ma'am
said a singular framework of clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them which advanced with the toes in no definite direction forwards but turned in or out as they chanced to swing
matthew mark did you say
 speak out  i shall not hurt you
inquired the young farmer kindly
matthew moon mem said henery fray correct ingly from behind her chair to which point he had edged himself
matthew moon
murmured bathsheba turning her bright eyes to the book
ten and twopence halfpenny is the sum put down to you i see
yes mis'ess
said matthew as the rustle of wind among dead leaves
here it is and ten shillings
now the next  andrew randle you are a new man i hear
how come you to leave your last farm
pppppplplplplllllease ma'am ppppplpl plplplease ma'amplease'mplease'm        'a's a stammering man mem
said henery fray in an undertone and they turned him away because the only time he ever did speak plain he said his soul was his own and other iniquities to the squire
a can cuss mem as well as you or i but 'a can't speak a common speech to save his life
andrew randle here's yours  finish thanking me in a day or two
temperance miller  oh here's another soberness  both women i suppose
yes'm
here we be 'a b'lieve
was echoed in shrill unison
what have you been doing
tending thrashingmachine and wimbling haybonds and saying hoosh
to the cocks and hens when they go upon your seeds and planting early flourballs and thompson's wonderfuls with a dibble
yes  i see
are they satisfactory women
she inquired softly of henery fray
o mem  don't ask me
yielding women
as scarlet a pair as ever was
groaned henery under his breath
sit down
who mem
sit down   joseph poorgrass in the background twitched and his lips became dry with fear of some terrible conse quences as he saw bathsheba summarily speaking and henery slinking off to a corner
now the next
laban tall you'll stay on working for me
for you or anybody that pays me well ma'am replied the young married man
true  the man must live
said a woman in the back quarter who had just entered with clicking pattens
what woman is that
bathsheba asked
i be his lawful wife
continued the voice with greater prominence of manner and tone
this lady called herself fiveandtwenty looked thirty passed as thirtyfive and was forty
she was a woman who never like some newly married showed conjugal tenderness in public perhaps because she had none to show
oh you are
said bathsheba
well laban will you stay on
yes he'll stay ma'am
said again the shrill tongue of laban's lawful wife
well he can speak for himself i suppose
o lord not he ma'am
a simple tool
well enough but a poor gawkhammer mortal
the wife replied   hehhehheh
laughed the married man with a hideous effort of appreciation for he was as irrepressibly goodhumoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings
the names remaining were called in the same manner
now i think i have done with you
said bathsheba closing the book and shaking back a stray twine of hair
has william smallbury returned
no ma'am
the new shepherd will want a man under him suggested henery fray trying to make himself official again by a sideway approach towards her chair
oh  he will
who can he have
young cain ball is a very good lad
henery said and shepherd oak don't mind his youth
he added turning with an apologetic smile to the shepherd who had just appeared on the scene and was now leaning against the doorpost with his arms folded
no i don't mind that
said gabriel
how did cain come by such a name
asked bathsheba
oh you see mem his pore mother not being a scriptureread woman made a mistake at his christening thinking 'twas abel killed cain and called en cain but 'twas too late for the name could never be got rid of in the parish
'tis very unfortunate for the boy
it is rather unfortunate
yes
however we soften it down as much as we can and call him cainey
ah pore widowwoman
she cried her heart out about it almost
she was brought up by a very heathen father and mother who never sent her to church or school and it shows how the sins of the parents are visited upon the children mem
mr
fray here drew up his features to the mild degree of melancholy required when the persons involved in the given misfortune do not belong to your own family
very well then cainey ball to be undershepherd and you quite understand your duties
 you i mean gabriel oak
quite well i thank you miss everdene
said shepard oak from the doorpost
if i don't i'll inquire
gabriel was rather staggered by the remark able coolness of her manner
certainly nobody without previous information would have dreamt that oak and the handsome woman before whom he stood had ever been other than strangers
but perhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields
the case is not unexampled in high places
when in the writings of the later poets jove and his family are found to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak of olympus into the wide sky above it their words show a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve
footsteps were heard in the passage combining in their character the qualities both of weight and measure rather at the expense of velocity
all
here's billy smallbury come from caster bridge
and what's the news
said bathsheba as william after marching to the middle of the hall took a hand kerchief from his hat and wiped his forehead from its centre to its remoter boundaries
i should have been sooner miss
he said if it hadn't been for the weather
he then stamped with each foot severely and on looking down his boots were perceived to be clogged with snow
come at last is it
said henery
well what about fanny
said bathsheba
well ma'am in round numbers she's run away with the soldiers
said william
no not a steady girl like fanny
i'll tell ye all particulars
when i got to caster bridge barracks they said  the eleventh dragoon guards be gone away and new troops have come
the eleventh left last week for melchester and onwards
the route came from government like a thief in the night as is his nature to and afore the eleventh knew it almost they were on the march
they passed near here
gabriel had listened with interest
i saw them go he said
yes
continued william they pranced down the street playing the girl i left behind me
so 'tis said in glorious notes of triumph
every lookeron's inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his deepest vitals and there was not a dry eye throughout the town among the publichouse people and the name less women
but they're not gone to any war
no ma'am but they be gone to take the places of them who may which is very close connected
and so i said to myself fanny's young man was one of the regiment and she's gone after him
there ma'am that's it in black and white
gabriel remained musing and said nothing for he was in doubt
well we are not likely to know more tonight at any rate
said bathsheba
but one of you had better run across to farmer boldwood's and tell him that much
she then rose but before retiring addressed a few words to them with a pretty dignity to which her mourning dress added a soberness that was hardly to be found in the words themselves
now mind you have a mistress instead of a master i don't yet know my powers or my talents in farming but i shall do my best and if you serve me well so shall i serve you
don't any unfair ones among you if there are any such but i hope not suppose that because i'm a woman i don't understand the difference between bad goingson and good
all
nom
liddy
excellent well said
i shall be up before you are awake i shall be afield before you are up and i shall have breakfasted before you are afield
in short i shall astonish you all
all
yes'm
and so goodnight
all
goodnight ma'am
then this smallthesmothete stepped from the table and surged out of the hall her black silk dress licking up a few straws and dragging them along with a scratch ing noise upon the floor
biddy elevating her feelings to the occasion from a sense of grandeur floated off behind bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely free from travesty and the door was closed
chapter xi    outside the barracks  snow  a meeting   for dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a certain town and military station many miles north of weatherbury at a later hour on this same snowy evening  if that may be called a prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitous ness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope  when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
the scene was a public path bordered on the left hand by a river behind which rose a high wall
on the right was a tract of land partly meadow'and partly moor reaching at its remote verge to a wide undulating uplan
the changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this kind than amid woodland scenery
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such wellknown ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
many are not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor or waste
winter in coming to the country hereabout advanced in wellmarked stages wherein might have been successively observed the retreat of the snakes the transformation of the ferns the filling of the pools a rising of fogs the embrowning by frost the collapse of the fungi and an obliteration by snow
this climax of the series had been reached tonight on the aforesaid moor and for the first time in the season its irregularities were forms without features suggestive of anything proclaiming nothing and without more character than that of being the limit of something else  the lowest layer of a firmament of snow
from this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and moor momentarily received additional clothing only to appear momentarily more naked thereby
the vast arch of cloud above was strangely low and formed as it were the roof of a large dark cavern gradually sinking in upon its floor for the instinctive thought was that the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass without any intervening stratum of air at all
we turn our attention to the lefthand characteristics which were flatness in respect of the river verticality in respect of the wall behind it and darkness as to both
these features made up the mass
if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath
the indistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys here and there and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows though only in the upper part
below down to the water's edge the flat was unbroken by hole or projection
an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere
it was a neighbouring clock striking ten the bell was in the open air and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow had lost its voice for the time
about this hour the snow abated  ten flakes fell where twenty had fallen then one had the room of ten
not long after a form moved by the brink of the river
by its outline upon the colourless background a close observer might have seen that it was small
this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human
the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
at this time some words were spoken aloud   one
two
three
four
five
between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
it was evident now that the windows high in the wall were being counted
the word five represented the fifth window from the end of the wall
here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller
the figure was stooping
then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
it smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark
the throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman
no man who had ever seen bird rabbit or squirrel in his childhood could possibly have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here
another attempt and another till by degrees the wall must have become pimpled with the adhering lumps of snow  at last one fragment struck the fifth window
the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirl pool
nothing was heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible wheels  together with a few small sounds which a sad man would have called moans and a happy man laughter  caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling objects in other parts of the stream
the window was struck again in the same manner
then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window
this was followed by a voice from the same quarter
who's there
the tones were masculine and not those of surprise
the high wall being that of a barrack and marriage being looked upon with disfavour in the army assigna tions and communications had probably been made across the river before tonight
is it sergeant troy
said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously
this person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth and the other speaker so much a part of the building that one would have said the wall was holding a conversation with the snow
yes
came suspiciously from the shadow
what girl are you
o frank  don't you know me
said the spot
your wife fanny robin
fanny
said the wall in utter astonishment
yes
said the girl with a halfsuppressed gasp of emotion
there was something in the woman's tone which is not that of the wife and there was a mannerin the man which is rarely a husband's
the dialogue went on how did you come here
i asked which was your window
forgive me
i did not expect you tonight
indeed i did not think you would come at all
it was a wonder you found me here
i am orderly tomorrow
you said i was to come
well  i said that you might
yes i mean that i might
you are glad to see me frank
o yes  of course
can you  come to me
my dear fan no
the bugle has sounded the barrack gates are closed and i have no leave
we are all of us as good as in the county gaol till tomorrow morning
then i shan't see you till then
the words were in a faltering tone of disappointment
how did you get here from weatherbury
i walked  some part of the way  the rest by the carriers
i am surprised
yes  so am i
and frank when will it be
what
that you promised
i don't quite recollect
o you do
don't speak like that
it weighs me to the earth
it makes me say what ought to be said first by you
never mind  say it
o must i
 it is when shall we be married frank
oh i  see
well   you have to get proper clothes
i have money
will it be by banns or license
banns i should think
and we live in two parishes
do we
what then
my lodgings are in st mary's and this is not
so they will have to be published in both
is that the law
yes
o frank  you think me forward i am afraid
don't dear frank  will you  for i love you so
and you said lots of times you would marry me and and  i  i  i       don't cry now
it is foolish
if i said so of course i will
and shall i put up the banns in my parish and will you in yours
yes tomorrow
not tomorrow
we'll settle in a few days
you have the permission of the officers
no not yet
o  how is it
you said you almost had before you left casterbridge
the fact is i forgot to ask
your coming like this i'll go away now
will you qodeand seq be tomorroy is so sudden and unexpected
yes  yes  it is
it was wrong of me to worry you
i'll go away now
will you come and see me tomorrow at mrs twills's in north street
i don't like to come to the barracks
there are bad women about and they think me one
quiteso
i'll come to you my dean goodnight
goodnight frank  goodnight
and the noise was again heard of a window closing the little spot moved away
when she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the wall
ho  ho  sergeant  ho  ho
an expostulation followed but it was indistinct and it became lost amid a low peal of laughter which was hardly distinguishable from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside
chapter xii    farmers  a rule  in exception   the first public evidence of bathsheba's decision to be a farmer in her own person and by proxy no more was her appearance the following marketday in
the cornmarket at casterbridge
the low though extensive hall supported by beams and pillars and latterly dignified bythe name of corn ex change was thronged with hot men who talked among each other in twos and threes the speaker of the minute looking sideways into his auditor's face and concentrating his argument by a contraction of one eyelid during de livery
the greater number carried in their hands groundash saplings using them partly as walkingsticks and partly for poking up pigs sheep neighbours with their backs turned and restful things in general which seemed to require such treatment in the course of their peregrinations
during conversations each subjected his sapling to great varieties of usage  bending it round his back forming anarch of it between his two hands overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a semicircle or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the arm whilst the samplebag was pulled forth and a hand ful of corn poured into the palm which after criticism was flung upon the floor an issue of events perfectly well known to halfadozen acute townbred fowls which had as usual crept into the building unobserved and waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high stretched neck and oblique eye
among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided the single one of her sex that the room contained
she was prettily and even daintily dressed
she moved between them as a chaise between carts was heard after them as a romance after sermons was felt among them like a breeze among furnaces
it had required a little determination  far more than she had at first imagined   to take up a position here for at her first entry the lumbering dialogues had ceased nearly every face had been turned towards her and those that were already turned rigidly fixed there
two or three only of the farmers were personally known to bathsheba and to these she had made her way
but if she was to be the practical woman she had intended to show herself business must be carried on introductions or none and she ultimately acquired con fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely known to her by hearsay
bathsheba too had her samplebags and by degrees adopted the professional pour into the hand  holding up the grains in her narrow palm for inspection in perfect casterbridge manner
something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth and in the keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when with parted lips she somewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a tall man suggested that there was potentiality enough in that lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of sex and daring enough to carry them out
but her eyes had a softness  invariably a softness  which had they not been dark would have seemed mistiness as they were it lowered an expression that might have been piercing to simple clearness strange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor she always allowed her interlocutors to finish their state ments before rejoining with hers
in arguing on prices he held to her own firmly as was natural in a dealer and reduced theirs persistently as was inevitable in a oman
but there was an elasticity in her firmness which removed it from obstinacy as there was a naivete in her cheapening which saved it from meanness
those of the farmers with whom she had no dealings by far the greater part were continually asking each other who is she
the reply would be  farmer everdene's niece took on weatherbury upper farm turned away the baily and swears she'll do everything herself
the other man would then shake his head
yes 'tis a pity she's so headstrong
the first would say
but we ought to be proud of her here  she lightens up the old place
'tis such a shapely maid however that she'll soon get picked up
it would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement in such an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism as had the beauty of her face and movements
however the interest was general and this saturday's debut in the forum whatever it may have been to bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer was unquestionably a triumph to her as the maiden
indeed the sensation was so pronounced that her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow like a little sister of a little jove and to neglect closing prices altogether
the numerous evidences ofher power to attract were only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception
women seem to have eyes in their ribbons for such matters as these
bathsheba without looking within a right angle of him was conscious of a black sheep among the flock
it perplexed her first
if there had been a respect able minority on either side the case would have been most natural
if nobody had regarded her she would have  taken the matter indifferently  such cases had occurred
if everybody this man included she would have taken it as a matter of course  people had done so before
but the smallness of the exception made the mystery
she soon knew thus much of the recusant's appear ance
he was a gentlemanly man with full and distinctly outlined roman features the prominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronzelike richness of tone
he was erect in attitude and quiet in demeanour
one characteristic preeminently marked him  dignity
apparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age at which a man's aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of a dozen years or so and artificially a woman't does likewise
thirtyfive and fifty were his limits of variation  he might have been either or anywhere between the two
it may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by the way
probably as with persons playing whist for love the consciousness of a certain immunity under any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate the having to pay makes them unduly speculative
bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person was not a married man
when marketing was over she rushed off to liddy who was waiting for her  beside the yellowing in which they had driven to town
the horse was put in and on they trotted bathsheba's sugar tea and drapery parcels being packed behind and expressing in some indescribable manner by their colour shape and general lineaments that they were that young lady farmer's property and the grocer's and drapers no more
i've been through it liddy and it is over
i shan't mind it again for they will all have grown accustomed to seeing me there but this morning it was as bad as being married  eyes everywhere
i knowed it would
be
liddy said men be such a terrible class of society to look at a body
but there was one man who had more sense than to waste his time upon me
the information was put in this form that liddy might not for a moment suppose her mistress was at all piqued
a very goodlooking man
she continued upright about forty i should think
do you know at all who he could be
liddy couldn't think
can't you guess at all
said bathsheba with some disappointment
i haven't a notion besides 'tis no difference since he took less notice of you than any of the rest
now if he'd taken more it would have mattered a great deal
bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just then and they bowled along in silence
a low carriage bowling along still more rapidly behind a horse of un impeachable breed overtook and passed them
why there he is
she said
liddy looked
that
that's farmer boldwood  of course 'tis  the man you couldn't see the other day when he called
oh farmer boldwood
murmured bathsheba and looked at him as he outstripped them
the farmer had never turned his head once but with eyes fixed on the most advanced point along the road passed as uncon sciously and abstractedly as if bathsheba and her charms were thin air
he's an interesting man  don't you think so
she remarked
o yes very
everybody owns it
replied liddy
i wonder why he is so wrapt up and indifferent and seemingly so far away from all he sees around him it is said  but not known for certain  that he met with some bitter disappointment when he was a young man and merry
a woman jilted him they say
people always say that  and we know very well women scarcely ever jilt men 'tis the men who jilt us
i expect it is simply his nature to be so reserved
simply his nature  i expect so miss  nothing else in the world
still 'tis more romantic to think he has been served cruelly poor thing'
perhaps after all he has
i depend upon it he has
o yes miss he has
feel he must have
however we are very apt to think extremes of people
i   shouldn't wonder after all if it wasn't a little of both  just between the two  rather cruelly used and rather reserved
o dear no miss  i can't think it between the two
that's most likely
well yes so it is
i am convinced it is most likely
you may   take my word miss that that's what's the matter with him
chapter xiii    sortes sanctorum  the valentine   it was sunday afternoon in the farmhouse on the thirteenth of february
dinner being over bathsheba for want of a better companion had asked liddy to come and sit with her
the mouldy pile was dreary in wintertime before the candles were lighted and the shutters closed the atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the walls every nook behind the furniture had a temperature of its own for the fire was not kindled in this part of the house early in the day and bathsheba's new piano which was an old one in other annals looked particularly sloping and out of level on the warped floor before night threw a shade over its less prominent angles and hid the unpleasantness
liddy like a little brook though shallow was always rippling her presence had not so much weight as to task thought and yet enough to exercise it
on the table lay an old quarto bible bound in leather
liddy looking at it said  did you ever find out miss who you are going to marry by means of the bible and key don't be so foolish liddy
as if such things could be
well there's a good deal in it all the same
nonsense child
and it makes your heart beat fearful
some believe in it some don't i do
very well let's try it
said bathsheba bounding from her seat with that total disregard of consistency which can be indulged in towards a dependent and entering into the spirit of divination at once
go and get the front door key
liddy fetched it
i wish it wasn't sunday
she said on returning
perhaps 'tis wrong
what's right week days is right sundays
replied her mistress in a tone which was a proof in itself
the book was opened  the leaves drab with age being quite worn away at muchread verses by the fore fingers of unpractised readers in former days where they were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision
the special verse in the book of ruth was sought out by bathsheba and the sublime words met her eye
they slightly thrilled and abashed her
it was wisdom in the abstract facing folly in the concrete
folly in the concrete blushed persisted in her intention and placed the key on the book
a rusty patch immediately upon the verse caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon told that this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the purpose
now keep steady and be silent
said bathsheba
the 'verse was repeated the book turned round bathsheba blushed guiltily
who did you try
said liddy curiously
i shall not tell you
did you notice mr boldwood's doings in church this morning miss
liddy continued adumbrating by the remark the track her thoughts had taken
no indeed
said bathsheba with serene indifference his pew is exactly opposite yours miss
i know it
and you did not see his goings on certainly i did not i tell you
liddy assumed a smaller physiognomy and shut her lips decisively
this move was unexpected and proportionately dis concerting
what did he do
bathsheba said perforce
didn't turn his head to look at you once all the service
why should he
again demanded her mistress wearing a nettled look
i didn't ask him to
oh no
but everybody else was noticing you and it was odd he didn't
there 'tis like him
rich and gentlemanly what does he care
bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to ex press that she had opinions on the matter too abstruse for liddy's comprehension rather than that she had nothing to say
dear me  i had nearly forgotten the valentine i bought yesterday
she exclaimed at length
valentine
who for miss
said liddy
farmer boldwood
it was the single name among all possible wrong ones that just at this moment seemed to bathsheba more pertinent than the right
well no
it is only for little teddy coggan
have promised him something and this will be a pretty surprise for him
liddy you may as well bring me my desk and i'll direct it at once
bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illumin ated and embossed design in postoctavo which had been bought on the previous marketday at the chief stationer's in casterbridge
in the centre was a small oval enclosure this was left blank that the sender might insert tender words more appropriate to the special occasion than any generalities by a printer could possibly be
here's a place for writing
said bathsheba
what shall i put
something of this sort i should think' returned liddy promptly   the rose is red  the violet blue  carnation's sweet  and so are you
yes that shall be it
it just suits itself to a chubby faced child like him
said bathsheba
she inserted the words in a small though legible handwriting enclosed the sheet in an envelope and dipped her pen for the direction
what fun it would be to send it to the stupid old boldwood and how he would wonder
said the irrepressible liddy lifting her eyebrows and indulging in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she thought of the moral and social magnitude of the man contem plated
bathsheba paused to regard the idea at full length
boldwood's had begun to be a troublesome image  a species of daniel in her kingdom who persisted in kneeling eastward when reason and common sense said that he might just as well follow suit with the rest and afford her the official glance of admiration which cost nothing at all
she was far from being seriously concerned about his nonconformity
still it was faintly depressing that the most dignified and valuable man in the parish should withhold his eyes and that a girl like liddy should talk about it
so liddy's idea was at first rather harassing than piquant
no i won't do that
he wouldn't see any humour in it
he'd worry to death
said the persistent liddy
really i don't care particularly to send it to teddy
remarked her mistress
he's rather a naughty child sometimes
yes  that he is
let's toss as men do
said bathsheba idly
now then head boldwood tail teddy
no we won't toss money on a sunday that would be tempting the devil indeed
toss this hymnbook there can't be no sinfulness in that miss
very well
open boldwood  shut teddy
no it's more likely to fall open
open teddy  shut boldwood
the book went fluttering in the air and came down shut
bathsheba a small yawn upon her mouth took the pen and with offhand serenity directed the missive to boldwood
now light a candle liddy
which seal shall we use
here's a unicorn's head   there's nothing in that
what's this
 two doves  no
it ought to be something extraordinary ought it not liddy
here's one with a motto  i remember it is some funny one but i can't read it
we'll try this and if it doesn't do we'll have another
a large red seal was duly affixed
bathsheba looked closely at the hot wax to discover the words
capital
she exclaimed throwing down the letter frolicsomely
'twould upset the solemnity of a parson the same evening the letter was sent and was duly returned to weatherbury again in the morning
of love as a spectacle bathsheba had a fair knowledge but of love subjectively she knew nothing
chapter xiv    effect of the letter  sunrise   at dusk on the evening of st valentine's day bold wood sat down to supper as usual by a beaming fire of aged logs
upon the mantelshelf before him was a timepiece surmounted by a spread eagle and upon the eagle's wings was the letter bathsheba had sent
here the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening itself till the large red seal became as a blot of blood on the retina of his eye and as he ate and drank he still read in fancy the words thereon although they were too remote for his sight  marry me
the pert injunction was like those crystal substances which colourless themselves assume the tone of objects about them
here in the quiet of boldwood's parlour where everything that was not grave was extraneous and where the atmosphere was that of a puritan sunday lasting all the week the letter and its dictum changed their tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity imbibed from their accessories now
since the receipt of the missive in the morning boldwood had felt the symmetry of his existence to be slowly getting distorted in the direction of an ideal passion
the disturbance was as the first floating weed to columbus  the eontemptibly little suggesting possibilities of the infinitely great
the letter must have had an origin and a motive
that the latter was of the smallest magnitude com patible with its existence at all boldwood of course did not know
and such an explanation did not strike him as a possibility even
it is foreign to a mystified condition of mind to realize of the mystifier that the processes of approving a course suggested by circumstance and of striking out a course from inner impulse would look the same in the result
the vast difference between starting a train of events and direct ing into a particular groove a series already started is rarely apparent to the person confounded by the issue
when boldwood went to bed he placed the valen tine in the corner of the lookingglass
he was conscious of its presence even when his back was turned upon it
it was the first time in boldwood's life that such an event had occurred
the same fascination that caused him to think it an act which had a deliberate motive prevented him from regarding it as an impertinence
he looked again at the direction
the mysterious influences of night invested the writing with the presence of the unknown writer
somebody's some woman's  hand had travelled softly over the paper bearing his name her unrevealed eyes had watched every curve as she formed it her brain had seen him in imagination the while
why should she have imagined him
her mouth  were the lips red or pale plump or creased
 had curved itself to a certain expression as the pen went on  the corners had moved with all their natural tremulousness  what had been the expression
the vision of the woman writing as a supplement to the words written had no individuality
she was a misty shape and well she might be considering that her original was at that moment sound asleep and oblivious of all love and letterwriting under the sky
whenever boldwood dozed she took a form and com paratively ceased to be a vision  when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream
the moon shone tonight and its light was not of a customary kind
his window admitted only a reflection of its rays and the pale sheen had that reversed direction which snow gives coming upward and lighting up his ceiling in an unnatural way casting shadows in strange places and putting lights where shadows had used to be
the substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in comparison with the fact of its arrival
he suddenly wondered if anything more might be found in the envelope than what he had withdrawn
he jumped out of bed in the weird light took the letter pulled out the flimsy sheet shook the envelope  searched it
nothing more was there
boldwood looked as he had a hundred times the preceding day at the insistent red seal  marry me
he said aloud
the solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the letter and stuck it in the frame of the glass
in doing so he caught sight of his reflected features wan in expression and insubstantial in form
he saw how closely compressed was his mouth and that his eyes were widespread and vacant
feeling uneasy and dis satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability he returned to bed
then the dawn drew on
the full power of the clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at noon when boldwood arose and dressed himself
he descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of a field to the east leaning over which he paused and looked around
it was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of the year and the sky pure violet in the zenith was leaden to the northward and murky to the east where over the snowy down or ewelease on weatherbury upper farm and apparently resting upon the ridge the only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless like a red and flameless fire shining over a white hearthstone
the whole effect resembled a sunset as childhood resembles age
in other directions the fields and sky were so much of one colour by the snow that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts the horizon occurred and in general there was here too that beforementioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which attends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky is found on the earth and the shades of earth are in the sky
over the west hung the wasting moon now dull and greenishyellow like tarnished brass
boldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had hardened and glazed the surface of the snow till it shone in the red eastern light with the polish of marble how in some portions of the slope withered grassbents encased in icicles bristled through the smooth wan coverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old venetian glass and how the footprints of a few birds which had hopped over the snow whilst it lay in the state of a soft fleece were now frozen to a short perma nency
a halfmuffled noise of light wheels interrupted him
boldwood turned back into the road
it was the mailcart  a crazy twowheeled vehicle hardly heavy enough to resist a puff of wind
the driver held out a letter
boldwood seized it and opened it ex pecting another anonymous one  so greatly are people's ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent will repeat itself
i don't think it is for you sir
said the man when he saw boldwood's action
though there is no name i think it is for your shepherd
boldwood looked then at the address  to the new shepherd weatherbury farm near casterbridge
oh  what a mistake
 it is not mine
nor is it for my shepherd
it is for miss everdene's
you had better take it on to him  gabriel oak  and say i opened it in mistake
at this moment on the ridge up against the blazing sky a figure was visible like the black snuff in the midst of a candleflame
then it moved and began to bustle about vigorously from place to place carrying square skeleton masses which were riddled by the same rays
a small figure on all fours followed behind
the tall form was that of gabriel oak the small one that of george the articles in course of transit were hurdles
wait said boldwood
that's the man on the hill
i'll take the letter to him myself
to boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to i another man
it was an opportunity
exhibiting a face pregnant with intention he entered the snowy field
gabriel at that minute descended the hill towards the right
the glow stretched down in this direction now and touched the distant roof of warren's malthouse whither the shepherd was apparently bent   boldwood followed at a distance
chapter xv    the scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate to its interior which was as usual lighted by a rival glow of similar hue radiating from the hearth
the maltster after having lain down in his clothes for a few hours was now sitting beside a threelegged table breakfasting of bread and bacon
this was eaten on the plateless system which is performed by placing a slice of bread upon the table the meat flat upon the bread a mustard plaster upon the meat and a pinch of salt upon the whole then cutting them vertically downwards with a large pocketknife till wood is reached when the severed lamp is impaled on the knife elevated and sent the proper way of food
the maltster's lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish his powers as a mill
he had been without them for so many years that toothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition
indeed he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic curve approaches a straight line  less directly as he got nearer till it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all
in the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting and a boiling pipkin of charred bread called coffee
for the benefit of whomsoever should call for warren's was a sort of clubhouse
used as an alternative to the in
i say says i we get a fine day and then down comes a snapper at night
was a remark now suddenly heard spreading into the malthouse from the door which had been opened the previous moment
the form of henery fray advanced to the fire stamping the snow from his boots when about halfway there
the speech and entry had not seemed to be at all an abrupt begin ning to the maltster introductory matter being often omitted in this neighbourhood both from word and deed and the maltster having the same latitude allowed him did not hurry to reply
he picked up a fragment of cheese by pecking upon it with his knife as a butcher picks up skewers
henery appeared in a drab kerseymere greatcoat buttoned over his smockfrock the white skirts of the latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below the coattails which when you got used to the style of dress looked natural enough and even ornamental  it certainly was comfortable
matthew moon joseph poorgrass and other carters and waggoners followed at his heels with great lanterns dangling from their hands which showed that they had just come from the carthorse stables where they had been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning
and how is she getting on without a baily
the maltster inquired
henery shook his head and smiled one of the bitter smiles dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre
she'll rue it  surely surely
he said  benjy pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily  as big a betrayer as judas iscariot himself
but to think she can carr' on alone
he allowed his head to swing laterally three or four times in silence
never in all my creeping up  never
this was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the head henery meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his face to imply that they would be required for use again directly he should go on speaking
all will be ruined and ourselves too or there's no meat in gentlemen's houses
said mark clark
a headstrong maid that's what she is  and won't listen to no advice at all
pride and vanity have ruined many a cobbler's dog
dear dear when i think o' it i sorrows like a man in travel
true henery you do i've heard ye
said joseph poorgrass in a voice of thorough attestation and with a wiredrawn smile of misery
'twould do a martel man no harm to have what's under her bonnet
said billy smallbury who had just entered bearing his one tooth before him
she can spaik real language and must have some sense some where
do ye foller me
i do but no baily  i deserved that place
wailed henery signifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at visions of a high destiny apparently visible to him on billy smallbury's smockfrock
there 'twas to be i suppose
your lot is your lot and scripture is nothing for if you do good you don't get rewarded according to your works but be cheated in some mean way out of your recompense
no no i don't agree with'ee there
said mark clark
god's a perfect gentleman in that respect
good works good pay so to speak it
attested joseph poorgrass
a short pause ensued and as a sort of entr'acte henery turned and blew out the lanterns which the increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even in the malthouse with its one pane of glass
i wonder what a farmerwoman can want with a harpsichord dulcimer pianner or whatever 'tis they d'call it
said the maltster
liddy saith she've a new one
got a pianner
ay
seems her old uncle's things were not good enough for her
she've bought all but everything new
there's heavy chairs for the stout weak and wiry ones for the slender great watches getting on to the size of clocks to stand upon the chimbleypiece
pictures for the most part wonderful frames
and long horsehair settles for the drunk with horse hair pillows at each end
said mr clark
likewise lookingglasses for the pretty and lying books for the wicked
firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside the door was opened about six inches and somebody on the other side exclaimed  neighbours have ye got room for a few newborn lambs
ay sure shepherd
said the conclave
the door was flung back till it kicked the wall and trembled from top to bottom with the blow
mr oak appeared in the entry with a steaming face hay bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow a leather strap round his waist outside the smockfrock and looking altogether an epitome of the world's health and vigour
four lambs hung in various embarrassing attitudes over his shoulders and the dog george whom gabriel had contrived to fetch from norcombe stalked solemnly behind
well shepherd oak and how's lambing this year if i mid say it
inquired joseph poorgrass
terrible trying said oak
i've been wet through twice aday either in snow or rain this last fortnight
cainy and i haven't tined our eyes tonight
a good few twins too i hear
too many by half
yes 'tis a very queer lambing this year
we shan't have done by lady day
and last year 'twer all over by sexajessamine sunday
joseph remarked
bring on the rest cain
said gabriel  and then run back to the ewes
i'll follow you soon
cainy ball  a cheeryfaced young lad with a small circular orifice by way of mouth advanced and deposited two others and retired as he was bidden
oak lowered the lambs from their unnatural elevation wrapped them in hay and placed them round the fire
we've no lambinghut here as i used to have at norcombe
said gabriel  and 'tis such a plague to bring the weakly ones to a house
if 'twasn't for your place here malter i don't know what i should do
this keen weather
and how is it with you today malter
oh neither sick nor sorry shepherd but no younger
ay  i understand
sit down shepherd oak continued the ancient man of malt
and how was the old place at norcombe when ye went for your dog
i should like to see the old familiar spot but faith i shouldn't know a soul there now
i suppose you wouldn't
'tis altered very much
is it true that dicky hill's wooden ciderhouse is pulled down
o yes  years ago and dicky's cottage just above it
well to be sure yes and tompkins's old appletree is rooted that used to bear two hogsheads of cider and no help from other trees
rooted
 you don't say it
ah
stirring times we live in  stirring times
and you can mind the old well that used to be in the middle of the place
that's turned into a solid iron pump with a large stone trough and all complete
dear dear  how the face of nations alter and what we live to see nowadays
yes  and 'tis the same here
they've been talking but now of the mis'ess's strange doings
what have you been saying about her
inquired oak sharply turning to the rest and getting very warm
these middleaged men have been pulling her over the coals for pride and vanity
said mark clark but i say let her have rope enough
bless her pretty face shouldn't i like to do so  upon her cherry lips
the gallant mark clark here made a peculiar and well known sound with his own
mark
said gabriel sternly now you mind this
none of that dalliancetalk  that smackandcoddle style of yours  about miss everdene
i don't allow it
do you hear 
with all my heart as i've got no chance
replied mr clark cordially
i suppose you've been speaking against her
said oak turning to joseph poorgrass with a very grim look
no no  not a word i  'tis a real joyful thing that she's no worse that's what i say
said joseph trembling and blushing with terror
matthew just said     matthew moon what have you been saying
asked oak
i
why ye know i wouldn't harm a worm  no not one underground worm
said matthew moon looking very uneasy
well somebody has  and look here neighbours
gabriel though one of the quietest and most gentle men on earth rose to the occasion with martial promptness and vigour
that's my fist
here he placed his fist rather smaller in size than a common loaf in the mathemarical centre of the maltster's little table and with it gave a bump or two thereon as if to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the idea of fistiness before he went further
now  the first man in the parish that i hear prophesying bad of our mistress why here the fist was raised and let fall as t'hor might have done with his hammer in assaying it  he'll smell and taste that  or i'm a dutchman
all earnestly expressed by their features that their minds did not wander to holland for a moment on account of this statement but were deploring the difference which gave rise to the figure and mark clark cried hear hear just what i should ha' said
the dog george looked up at the same time after the shepherd's menace and though he understood english but imperfectly began to growl
now don't ye take on so shepherd and sit down
said henery with a deprecating peacefulness equal to anything of the kind in christianity
we hear that ye be a extraordinary good and clever man shepherd
said joseph poorgrass with considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed stead whither he had retired for safety
'tis a great thing to be clever i'm sure
he added making move ments associated with states of mind rather than body we wish we were don't we neighbours
ay that we do sure
said matthew moon with a small anxious laugh towards oak to show how very friendly disposed he was likewise
who's been telling you i'm clever
said oak
'tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common said matthew
we hear that ye can tell the time as well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon shepherd
yes i can do a little that way
said gabriel as a man of medium sentiments on the subject
names upon their waggons almost like copperplate with beautiful flourishes and great long tails
a excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man shepherd
joseph poorgrass used to prent to farmer james everdene's waggons before you came and 'a could never mind which way to turn the j's and e's   could ye joseph
joseph shook his head to express how absolute was the fact that he couldn't
and so you used to do 'em the wrong way like this didn't ye joseph
matthew marked on the dusty floor with his whiphandle
and how farmer james would cuss and call thee a fool wouldn't he joseph when 'a seed his name looking so insideoutlike
continued matthew moon with feeling
ay  'a would
said joseph meekly
but you see i wasn't so much to blame for them j's and e's be such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind whether they face backward or forward and i always had such a forgetful memory too
'tis a bad afiction for ye being such a man of calamities in other ways
well 'tis but a happy providence ordered that it should be no worse and i feel my thanks
as to shepherd there i'm sure mis'ess ought to have made ye her baily  such a fitting man for't as you be
i don't mind owning that i expected it
said oak frankly
indeed i hoped for the place
at the same time miss everdene has a right to be own baily if she choose  and to keep me down to be a common shepherd only
oak drew a slow breath looked sadly into the bright ashpit and seemed lost in thoughts not of the most hopeful hue
the genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate the nearly lifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs briskly upon the hay and to recognize for the first time the fact that they were born
their noise increased to a chorus of baas upon which oak pulled the milkcan from before the fire and taking a small teapot from the pocket of his smockfrock filled it with milk and taught those of the helpless creatures which were not to be restored to their dams how to drink from the spout  a trick they acquired with astonishing aptitude
and she don't even let ye have the skins of the dead lambs i hear
resumed joseph poorgrass his eyes lingering on the operations of oak with the neces sary melancholy
i don't have them
said gabriel
ye be very badly used shepherd
hazarded joseph again in the hope of getting oak as an ally in lamenta tion after all
i think she's took against ye  that i do
o no  not at all
replied gabriel hastily and a sigh escaped him which the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused
before any further remark had been added a shade darkened the door and boldwood entered the malthouse bestowing upon each a nod of a quality between friendli ness and condescension
ah
oak i thought you were here
he said
i met the mailcart ten minutes ago and a letter was put into my hand which i opened without reading the address
i believe it is yours
you must excuse the accident please
o yes  not a bit of difference mr boldwood  not a bit
said gabriel readily
he had not a corre spondent on earth nor was there a possible letter coming to him whose contents the whole parish would not have been welcome to persue
oak stepped aside and read the following in an unknown hand  dear friend  i do not know your name but l think these few lines will reach you which i wrote to thank you for your kindness to me the night i left weatherbury in a reckless way
i also return the money i owe you which you will excuse my not keeping as a gift
all has ended well and i am happy to say i am going to be married to the young man who has courted me for some time  sergeant troy of the th dragoon guards now quartered in this town
he would i know object to my having received anything except as a loan being a man of great respecta bility and high honour  indeed a nobleman by blood
i should be much obliged to you if you would keep the contents of this letter a secret for the present dear friend
we mean to surprise weatherbury by coming there soon as husband and wife though l blush to state it to one nearly a stranger
the sergeant grew up in weatherbury
thank ing you again for your kindness i am your sincere wellwisher fanny robin
have you read it mr
boldwood
said gabriel if not you had better do so
i know you are interested in fanny robin
boldwood read the letter and looked grieved
fanny  poor fanny
the end she is so confident of has not yet come she should remember  and may never come
i see she gives no address
what sort of a man is this sergeant troy
said gabriel
h'm  i'm afraid not one to build much hope upon in such a case as this
the farmer murmured though he's a clever fellow and up to everything
a slight romance attaches to him too
his mother was a french governess and it seems that a secret attachment existed between her and the late lord severn
she was married to a poor medical man and soon after an infant was horn and while money was forthcoming all went on well
unfortunately for her boy his best friends died and he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's in casterbridge
he stayed there for some time and might have worked himself into a dignified position of some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak of enlisting
i have much doubt if ever little fanny will surprise us in the way she mentions  very much doubt a silly girl
 silly girl
the door was hurriedly burst open again and in came running cainy ball out of breath his mouth red and open like the bell of a penny trumpet from which he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face
now cain ball
said oak sternly why will you run so fast and lose your breath so
i'm always telling you of it
oh  i  a puff of mee breath  went  the  wrong way please mister oak and made me cough  hok  hok
well   what have you come for
i've run to tell ye
said the junior shepherd supporting his exhausted youthful frame against the doorpost that you must come directly'
two more ewes have twinned  that's what's the matter shepherd oak
oh that's it
said oak jumping up and dimissing for the present his thoughts on poor fanny
you are a good boy to run and tell me cain and you shall smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat
but before we go cainy bring the tarpot and we'll mark this lot and have done with 'em
oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron dipped it into the pot and imprintcd on the buttocks of the infant sheep the initials of her he delighted to muse on  b e which signified to all the region round that henceforth the lambs belonged to farmer bathsheba everdene and to no one else
now cainy shoulder your two and off good morning mr
boldwood
the shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had himself brought and vanished with them in the direction of the lambing field hard by  their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful state pleasantly contrasting with their death'sdoor plight of half an hour before
boldwood followed him a little way up the field hesitated and turned back
he followed him again with a last resolve annihilating return
on approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed the farmer drew outhis pocketbook unfastenedit and allowed it to lie open on his hand
a letter was revealed  bath sheba's
i was going to ask you oak
he said with unreal carelessness if you know whose writing this is 
oak glanced into the book and replied instantly with a flushed face  miss everdene's
oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name
he now felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought
the letter could of course be no other than anonymous or the inquiry would not have been necessary
boldwood mistook his confusion  sensitive persons are always ready with their is it i
in preference to objective reasoning
the question was perfectly fair
he returned  and there was something incongruous in the serious earnest ness with which he applied himself to an argument on a valentine
you know it is always expected that privy inquiries will be made  that's where the  fun lies
if the word fun had been torture
it could not have been uttered with a more constrained and restless countenance than was boldwood's then
soon parting from gabriel the lonely and reserved man returned to his house to breakfast  feeling twinges of shame and regret at having so far exposed his mood by those fevered questions to a stranger
he again placed the letter on the mantelpiece and sat down to think of the circumstances attending it by the light of gabriel's information
chapter xvi    all saints' and all souls'   on a weekday morning a small congregation con sisting mainly of women and girls rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church called all saints' in the distant barracktown before mentioned at the end of a service without a sermon
they were about to disperse when a smart footstep entering the porch and coming up the central passage arrested their attention
the step echoed with a ring unusual in a church it was the clink of spurs
everybody looked
a young cavalry soldier in a red uniform with the three chevrons of a sergeant upon his sleeve strode up the aisle with an embarrassment which was only the more marked by the intense vigour of his step and by the deter mination upon his face to show none
a slight flush had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these women but passing on through the chancel arch he never paused till he came close to the altar railing
here for a moment he stood alone
the officiating curate who had not yet doffed his surplice perceived the newcomer and followed him to the communionspace
he whispered to the soldier and then beckoned to the clerk who in his turn whispered to an elderly woman apparently his wife and they also went up the chancel steps
'tis a wedding
murmured some of the women brightening
let's wait
the majority again sat down
there was a creaking of machinery behind and some of the young ones turned their heads
from the interior face of the west wall of the tower projected a little canopy with a quarterjack and small bell beneath it the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery that struck the large bell in the tower
be tween the tower and the church was a close screen the door of which was kept shut during services hiding this grotesque clockwork from sight
at present how ever the door was open and the egress of the jack the blows on the bell and the mannikin's retreat intothe nook again were visible to many and audible through out the church
the jack had struck halfpast eleven
where's the woman
whispered some of the spectators
the young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old pillars around
he faced the south east and was as silent as he was still
the silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on and nobody else appeared and not a soul moved
the rattle of the quarterjack again from its niche its blows for threequarters its fussy retreat were almost painfully abrupt and caused many of the congregation to start palpably
i wonder where the woman is
a voice whispered again
there began now that slight shifting of feet that artificial coughing among several which betrays a nervous suspense
at length there was a titter
but the soldier never moved
there he stood his face to the southeast upright as a column his cap in his hand
the clock ticked on
the women threw off their nervousness and titters and giggling became more frequent
then came a dead silence
every one was waiting for the end
some persons may have noticed how extraordinarily the striking of quarters
seems to quicken the flight of time
it was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with the minutes when the rattle began again the puppet emerged and the four quarters were struck fitfully as before one could al most be positive that there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature's face and a mischievous delight in its twitchings
then followed the dull and remote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower above
the women were impressed and there was no giggle this time
the clergyman glided into the vestry and the clerk vanished
the sergeant had not yet turned every woman in the church was waiting to see his face and he appeared to know it
at last he did turn and stalked resolutely down the nave braving them all with a compressed lip
two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other and chuckled innocently enough but the sound had a strange weird effect in that place
opposite to the church was a paved square around which several overhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade
the young man on leaving the door went to cross the square when in the middle he met a little woman
the expression of her face which had been one of intense anxiety sank at the sight of his nearly to terror
well
he said in a suppressed passion fixedly looking at her
o frank  i made a mistake
 i thought that church with the spire was all saints' and i was at the door at halfpast eleven to a minute as you said
waited till a quarter to twelve and found then that i was in all souls'
but i wasn't much frightened for i thought it could be tomorrow as well
you fool for so fooling me
but say no more
shall it be tomorrow frank
she asked blankly
tomorrow
and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh
i don't go through that experience again for some time i warrant you
but after all
she expostulated in a trembling voice the mistake was not such a terrible thing
now dear frank when shall it be
ah when
god knows
he said with a light irony and turning from her walked rapidly away
chapter xvii    in the marketplace   on saturday boldwood was in casterbridge market house as usual when the disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him
adam had awakened from his deep sleep and behold
there was eve
the farmer took courage and for the first time really looked at her
material causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in regular equation
the result from capital employed in the production of any movement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause itself is absurdly minute
when women are in a freakish mood their usual intuition either from carelessness or inherent defect seemingly fails to teach them this and hence it was that bathsheba was fated to be astonished today
boldwood looked at her  not slily critically or understandingly but blankly at gaze in the way a reaper looks up at a passing train  as something foreign to his element and but dimly understood
to bold wood women had been remote phenomena rather than necessary complements  comets of such uncertain aspect movement and permanence that whether their orbits were as geometrical unchangeable and as subject to laws as his own or as absolutely erratic as they superficially appeared he had not deemed it his duty to consider
he saw her black hair her correct facial curves and profile and the roundness of her chin and throat
he saw then the side of her eyelids eyes and lashes and the shape of her ear
next he noticed her figure her skirt and the very soles of her shoes
boldwood thought her beautiful but wondered whether he was right in his thought for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh if so sweet as he imagined could have been going on long without creating a commotion of delight among men and pro voking more inquiry than bathsheba had done even though that was not a little
to the best of his judge ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect one of an imperfect many
his heart began to move within him
boldwood it must be remembered though forty years of age had never before inspected a woman with the very centre and force of his glance they had struck upon all his senses at wide angles
was she really beautiful
he could not assure himself that his opinion was true even now
he fur tively said to a neighbour is miss everdene considered handsome
o yes she was a good deal noticed the first time she came if you remember
a very handsome girl indeed
a man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is half or quite in love with a mere child's word on the point has the weight of an ra's
boldwood was satisfied now
and this charming woman had in effect said to him marry me
why should she have done that strange thing
boldwood's blindness to the difference between approving of what circumstances suggest and originating what they do not suggest was well matched by bathsheba's insensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings
she was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer adding up accounts with him as indiffer ently as if his face had been the pages of a ledger
it was evident that such a nature as his had no attraction for a woman of bathsheba's taste
but boldwood grew hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy he trod for the first time the threshold of the injured lover's hell
his first impulse was to go and thrust himself between them
this could be done but only in one way  by asking to see a sample of her corn
boldwood renounced the idea
he could not make the request it was debasing loveliness to ask it to buy and sell and jarred with his conceptions of her
all this time bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that dignified stronghold at last
his eyes she knew were following her everywhere
this was a triumph and had it come naturally such a triumph would have been the sweeter to her for this piquing delay
but it had been brought about by misdirected ingenuity and she valued it only as she valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit
being a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein her heart was not involved bath sheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed its existence as much to liddy as to herself should ever have been undertaken to disturb the placidity of a man she respected too highly to deliberately tease
she that day nearly formed the intention of begging his pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting
the worst features of this arrangement were that if he thought she ridiculed him an apology would in crease the offence by being disbelieved and if he thought she wanted him to woo her it would read like additional evidence of her forwardness
chapter xviii    boldwood in meditation  regret   boldwood was tenant of what was called little weatherbury farm and his person was the nearest ap proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the parish could boast of
genteel strangers whose god was their town who might happen to be compelled to linger about this nook for a day heard the sound of light wheels and prayed to see good society to the degree of a solitary lord or squire at the very least but it was only mr boldwood going out for the day
they heard the sound of wheels yet once more and were reanimated to expectancy  it was only mr bold wood coming home again
his house stood recessed from the road and the stables which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a room were behind their lower portions being lost amid bushes of laurel
inside the blue door open halfway down were to be seen at this time the backs and tails of halfadozen warm and contented horses standing in their stalls and as thus viewed they pre sented alternations of roan and bay in shapes like a moorish arch the tail being a streak down the midst of each
over these and lost to the eye gazing in from the outer light the mouths of the same animals could be heard busily sustaining the abovenamed warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay
the restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered about a loosebox at the end whilst the steady grind of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot
pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was farmer boldwood himself
this place was his almonry and cloister in one  here after looking to the feeding of his fourfooted dependants the celibate would walk and meditate of an evening till the moon's rays streamed in through the cobwebbed windows or total darkness enveloped the scene
his squareframed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the crowd and bustle of the markethouse
in this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel and toe simultaneously and his fine reddishfleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the still mouth and the wellrounded though rather prominent and broad chin
a few clear and threadlike horizontal lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead
the phases of boldwood's life were ordinary enough but his was not an ordinary nature
that stillness which struck casual observers more than anything else in his character and habit and seemed so precisely like the rest of inanition may have been the perfect balance of enormous antagonistic forces  positives and negatives in fine adjustment
his equilibrium disturbed he was in extremity at once
if an emotion possessed him at all it ruled him a feeling not mastering him was entirely latent
stagnant or rapid it was never slow
he was always hit mortally or he was missed
he had no light and careless touches in his constitu tion either for good or for evil
stern in the outlines of action mild in the details he was serious throughout all
he saw no absurd sides to the follies of life and thus though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry men and scoffers and those to whom all things show life as a jest he was not intolerable to the earnest and those acquainted with grief
being a man who read all the dramas of life seriously if he failed to please when they were comedies there was no frivolous treat ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end tragically
bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon which she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic intensity
had she known boldwood's moods her blame would have been fearful and the stain upon her heart ineradicable
moreover had she known her present power for good or evil over this man she would have trembled at her responsibility
luckily for her present unluckily for her future tran quillity her understanding had not yet told her what boldwood was
nobody knew entirely for though it was possible to form guesses concerning his wild capa bilities from old floodmarks faintly visible he had never been seen at the high tides which caused them
farmer boldwood came to the stabledoor and looked forth across the level fields
beyond the first enclosure was a hedge and on the other side of this a meadow belonging to bathsheba's farm
it was now early spring  the time of going to grass with the sheep when they have the first feed of the meadows before these are laid up for mowing
the wind which had been blowing east for several weeks had veered to the southward and the middle of spring had come abruptly  almost without a beginning
it was that period in the vernal quarter when we map suppose the dryads to be waking for the season
the vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise till in the completest silence of lone gardens and trackless plantations where everything seems help less and still after the bond and slavery of frost there are bustlings strainings united thrusts and pullsall together in comparison with which the powerful tugs of cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts
boldwood looking into the distant meadows saw there three figures
they were those of miss everdene shepherd oak and cainy ball
when bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's eyes it lighted him up as the moon lights up a great tower
a man's body is as the shell or the tablet of his soul as he is reserved or ingenuous overflowing or selfcontained
there was a  change in boldwood's exterior from its former impassibleness and his face showed that he was now living outside his defences for the first time and with a fearful sense of exposure
it is the usual experience of strong natures when they love
at last he arrived at a conclusion
it was to go across and inquire boldly of her
the insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years without a channel of any kind for disposable emotion had worked its effect
it has been observed more than once that the causes of love are chiefly subjective and boldwood was a living testimony to the truth of the proposition
no mother existed to absorb his devotion no sister for his tenderness no idle ties for sense
he became surcharged with the compound which was genuine lover's love
he approached the gate of the meadow
beyond it the ground was melodious with ripples and the sky with larks the low bleating of the flock mingling with both
mistress and man were engaged in the operation of making a lamb take
which is performed whenever an ewe has lost her own offspring one of the twins of another ewe being given her as a substitute
gabriel had skinned the dead lamb and was tying the skin over the body of the live lamb in the customary manner whilst bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four hurdles into which the mother and foisted lamb were driven where they would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for the young one
bathsheba looked up at the completion of the manouvre and saw the farmer by the gate where he was overhung by a willow tree in full bloom
gabriel to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an april day was ever regardful of its faintest changes and instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence from without in the form of a keenly selfconscious reddening
he also turned and beheld boldwood
at onee connecting these signs with the letter bold wood had shown him gabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that means and carried on since he knew not how
farmer boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware of his presence and the perception was as too much light turned upon his new sensibility
he was still in the road and by moving on he hoped that neither would recognize that he had originally intended to enter the field
he passed by with an utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance shyness and doubt
perhaps in her manner there were signs that she wished to see him  perhaps not  he could not read a woman
the cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways
every turn look word and accent contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious import and not one had ever been pondered by him until now
as for bathsheba she was not deceived into the belief that farmer boldwood had walked by on business or in idleness
she collected the probabilities of the case and concluded that she was herself responsible for boldwood's appearance there
it troubled her much to see what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle
bathsheba was no schemer for marriage nor was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men and a censor's experience on seeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling of surprise that bathsheba could be so different from such a one and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be
she resolved never again by look or by sign to interrupt the steady flow of this man's life
but a resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible
chapter xix    the sheepwashing  the offer   boldwood did eventually call upon her
she was not at home
of course not
he murmured
in con templating bathsheba as a woman he had forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist  that being as much of a farmer and as extensive a farmer as himself her probable whereabouts was outofdoors at this time of the year
this and the other oversights boldwood was guilty of were natural to the mood and still more natural to the circumstances
the great aids to idealization in love were present here  occasional observation of her from a distance and the absence of social intercourse with her  visual familiarity oral strangeness
the smaller human elements were kept out of sight the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by the accident of lover and lovedone not being on visiting terms and there was hardly awakened a thought in boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her or that she like all others had moments of commonplace when to be least plainly seen was to be most prettily remembered
thus a mild sort of apotheosis took place in his fancy whilst she still lived and breathed within his own horizon a troubled creature like himself
it was the end of may when the farmer determined to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense
he had by this time grown used to being in love the passion now startled him less even when it tortured him more and he felt himself adequate to the situation
on inquiring for her at her house they had told him she was at the sheepwashing and he went off to seek her there
the sheepwashing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in the meadows full of the clearest water
to birds on the wing its glassy surface reflecting the light sky must have been visible for miles around as a glistening cyclops' eye in a green face
the grass about the margin at this season was a sight to remember long  in a minor sort of way
its activity in sucking the moisture from the rich damp sod
was almost a pro cess observable by the eye
the outskirts of this level watermeadow were diversified by rounded and hollow pastures where just now every flower that was not a buttercup was a daisy
the river slid along noiselessly as a shade the swelling reeds and sedge forming a flexible palisade upon its moist brink
to the north of the mead were trees the leaves of which were new soft and moist not yet having stiffened and darkened under summer sun and drought their colour being yellow beside a green  green beside a yellow
from the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the still air
boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots which the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations
a tribu tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its diameter
shepherd oak jan coggan moon poor grass cain ball and several others were assembled here all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair and bathsheba was standing by in a new ridinghabit  the most elegant she had ever worn  the reins of her horse being looped over her arm
flagons of cider were rolling about upon the green
the meek sheep were pushed into the pool by coggan and matthew moon who stood by the lower hatch immersed to their waists then gabriel who stood on the brink thrust them under as they swam along with an instrument like a crutch formed for the purpose and also for assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became saturated and they began to sink
they were let out against the stream and through the upper opening all impurities flowing away below
cainy ball and joseph who performed this latter operation were if possible wetter than the rest they resembled dolphins under a fountain every protuberance and angle of their clothes dribbling forth a small rill
boldwood came close and bade her goodmorning with such constraint that she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for its own sake hoping not to find her there more she fancied his brow severe and his eye slighting
bathsheba immediately contrived to withdraw and glided along by the river till she was a stone's throw off
she heard footsteps brushing the grass and had a consciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume
instead of turning or waiting bathsheba went further among the high sedges but boldwood seemed determined and pressed on till they were completely past the bend of the river
here without being seen they could hear the splashing and shouts of the washers above
miss everdene
said the farmer
she trembled turned and said good morning
his tone was so utterly removed from all she had expected as a beginning
it was lowness and quiet accentuated  an emphasis of deep meanings their form at the same time being scarcely expressed
silence has sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as the disembodied soul of feeling wandering without its carcase and it is then more impressive than speech
in the same way to say a little is often to tell more than to say a great deal
boldwood told everything in that word
as the consciousness expands on learning that what was fancied to be the rumble of wheels is the reverbera tion of thunder so did bathsheba's at her intuitive conviction
i feel  almost too much  to think
he said with a solemn simplicity
i have come to speak to you with out preface
my life is not my own since i have beheld you clearly miss everdene  i come to make you an offer of marriage
bathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral countenance and all the motion she made was that of closing lips which had previously been a little parted
i am now fortyone years old
he went on
i may have been called a confirmed bachelor and i was a confirmed bachelor
i had never any views of myself as a husband in my earlier days nor have i made any calculation on the subject since i have been older
but we all change and my change in this matter came with seeing you
i have felt lately more and more that my present way of living is bad in every respect
beyond all things i want you as my wife
i feel mr boldwood that though i respect you much i do not feel  what would justify me to  in accepting your offer
she stammered
this giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to open the sluices of feeling that boldwood had as yet kept closed
my life is a burden without you
he exclaimed in a low voice
i want you  i want you to let me say i love you again and again
bathsheba answered nothing and the mare upon her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up
i think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what i have to tell
bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he thought that till she remembered that far from being a conceited assumption on boldwood's part it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec tion based on deceptive premises of her own offering
i wish i could say courteous flatteries to you
the farmer continued in an easier tone  and put my rugged feeling into a graceful shape but i have neither power nor patience to learn such things
i want you for my wife  so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me but i should not have spoken out had i not been led to hope
the valentine again
o that valentine
she said to herself but not a word to him
if you can love me say so miss everdene
if not   don't say no
mr boldwood it is painful to have to say i am surprised so that i don't know how to answer you with propriety and respect  but am only just able to speak out my feeling  i mean my meaning that i am afraid i can't marry you much as i respect you
you are too dignified for me to suit you sir
but miss everdene
i  i didn't  i know i ought never to have dreamt of sending that valentine  forgive me sir  it was a wanton thing which no woman with any selfrespect should have done
if you will only pardon my thought lessness i promise never to     no no no
don't say thoughtlessness
make me think it was something more  that it was a sort of prophetic instinct  the beginning of a feeling that you would like me
you torture me to say it was done in thoughtlessness  i never thought of it in that light and i can't endure it
ah
i wish i knew how to win you
but that i can't do  i can only ask if i have already got you
if i have not and it is not true that you have come unwittingly to me as i have to you i can say no more
i have not fallen in love with you mr boldwood  certainly i must say that
she allowed a very small smile to creep for the first time over her serious face in saying this and the white row of upper teeth and keenly cut lips already noticed suggested an idea of heartless ness which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant eyes
but you will just think  in kindness and conde scension think  if you cannot bear with me as a husband
i fear i am too old for you but believe me i will take more care of you than would many a man of your own age
i will protect and cherish you with all my strength   i will indeed
you shall have no cares  be worried by no household affairs and live quite at ease miss everdene
the dairy superintendence shall be done by a man  i can afford it will  you shall never have so much as to look out of doors at haymaking time or to think of weather in the harvest
i rather cling to the chaise because it is he same my poor father and mother drove but if you don't like it i will sell it and you shall have a ponycarriage of your own
i cannot say how far above every other idea and object on earth you seem to me  nobody knows  god only knows  how much you are to me
bathsheba's heart was young and it swelled with sympathy for the deepnatured man who spoke so simply
don't say it
don't
i cannot bear you to feel so much and me to feel nothing
and i am afraid they will notice us mr boldwood
will you let the matter rest now
i cannot think collectedly
i did not know you were going to say this to me
o i am wicked to have made you suffer so
she was frightened as well as agitated at his vehemence
say then that you don't absolutely refuse
do not quite refuse
i can do nothing
i cannot answer
i may speak to you again on the subject
yes
i may think of you
yes i suppose you may think of me
and hope to obtain you
no  do not hope
let us go on
i will call upon you again tomorrow
no  please not
give me time
yes  i will give you any time
he said earnestly and gratefully
i am happier now
no  i beg you
don't be happier if happiness only comes from my agreeing
be neutral mr bold wood
i must think
i will wait
he said
and then she turned away
boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground and stood long like a man who did not know where he was
realities then returned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an excitement which eclipses it and he too then went on
chapter xx    perplexity  grinding the shears  a quarrel   he is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that i can desire
bathsheba mused
yet farmer boldwood whether by nature kind or the reverse to kind did not exercise kindness here
the rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self indulgence and no generosity at all
bathsheba not being the least in love with him was eventually able to look calmly at his offer
it was one which many women of her own station in the neighbour hood and not a few of higher rank would have been wild to accept and proud to publish
in every point of view ranging from politic to passionate it was desirable that she a lonely girl should marry and marry this earnest welltodo and respected man
he was close to her doors his standing was sufficient his qualities were even supererogatory
had she felt which she did not any wish whatever for the married state in the abstract she could not reasonably have rejected him being a woman who frequently appealed to her under standing for deliverance from her whims
boldwood as a means to marriage was unexceptionable she esteemed and liked him yet she did not want him
it appears that ordinary men take wives because possession is not possible without marriage and that ordinary women accept husbands because marriage is not possible with out possession with totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides
but the understood incentive on the woman's part was wanting here
besides bath sheba's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a novel one and the novelty had not yet begun to wear off
but a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit for it would have affected few
beyond the men tioned reasons with which she combated her objections she had a strong feeling that having been the one who began the game she ought in honesty to accept the conse quences
still the reluctance remained
she said in the same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry boldwood and that she couldn't do it to save her life
bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera tive aspect
an elizabeth in brain and a mary stuart in spirit she often performed actions of the greatest temerity with a manner of extreme discretion
many of her thoughts were perfect syllogisms unluckily they always remained thoughts
only a few were irrational assumptions but unfortunately they were the ones which most frequently grew into deeds
the next day to that of the declaration she found gabriel oak at the bottom of her garden grinding his shears for the sheepshearing
all the surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign
peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara tion  sickles scythes shears and pruninghooks ranking with swords bayonets and lances in their common necessity for point and edge
cainy ball turned the handle of gabriel's grindstone his head performing a melancholy seesaw up and down with each turn of the wheel
oak stood somewhat as eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his arrows his figure slightly bent the weight of his body thrown over on the shears and his head balanced side ways with a critical compression of the lips and contrac tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude
his mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or two then she said  cain go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare
i'll turn the winch of the grindstone
i want to speak to you gabriel
cain departed and bathsheba took the handle
gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise quelled its expression and looked down again
bathsheba turned the winch and gabriel applied the shears
the peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind
it is a sort of attenuated variety of ixion's punishment and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of heavy and the body's centre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere be tween the eyebrows and the crown
bathsheba felt the unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen turns
will you turn gabriel and let me hold the shears
she said
my head is in a'whirl and i can't talk
gabriel turned
bathsheba then began with some awkwardness allowing her thoughts to stray occasion ally from her story to attend to the shears which required a little nicety in sharpening
i wanted to ask you if the men made any observa tions on my going behind the sedge with mr boldwood yesterday
yes they did
said gabriel
you don't hold the shears right miss  i knew you wouldn't know the way  hold like this
he relinquished the winch and inclosing her two hands completely in his own taking each as we some times slap a child's hand in teaching him to write grasped the shears with her
incline the edge so he said
hands and shears were inclined to suit the words and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in structor as he spoke
that will do
exclaimed bathsheba
loose my hands
i won't have them held
turn the winch
gabriel freed her hands quietly retired to his handle and the grinding went on
did the men think it odd
she said again
odd was not the idea miss
what did they say
that farmer boldwood's name and your own were likely to be flung over pulpit together before the year was out
i thought so by the look of them
why there's nothing in it
a more foolish remark was never made and i want you to contradict it
that's what i came for
gabriel looked incredulous and sad but between his moments of incredulity relieved
they must have heard our conversation
she continued
well then bathsheba
said oak stopping the handle and gazing into her face with astonishment
miss everdene you mean she said with dignity
i mean this that if mr boldwood really spoke of marriage i bain't going to tell a story and say he didn't to please you
i have already tried to please you too much for my own good
bathsheba regarded him with roundeyed perplexity
she did not know whether to pity him for disappointed love of her or to be angry with him for having got over it  his tone being ambiguous
i said i wanted you just to mention that it was not true i was going to be married to him
she mur mured with a slight decline in her assurance
i can say that to them if you wish miss everdene
and i could likewise give an opinion to 'ee on what you have done
i daresay
but i don't want your opinion
i suppose not
said gabriel bitterly and going on with his turning his words rising and falling in a regular swell and cadence as he stooped or rose with the winch which directed them according to his position perpendicularly into the earth or horizontally along the garden his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon the ground
with bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act but as does not always happen time gained was prudence insured
it must be added however that time was very seldom gained
at this period the single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings that she valued as sounder than her own was gabriel oak's
and the outspoken honesty of his character was such that on any subject even that of her love for or marriage with another man the same disinter estedness of opinion might be calculated on and be had for the asking
thoroughly convinced of the impossibility of his own suit a high resolve constrained him not to injure that of another
this is a lover's most stoical virtue as the lack of it is a lover's most venial sin
knowing he would reply truly she asked the question painful as she must have known the sub ject would be
such is the selfishness of some charm ing women
perhaps it was some excuse for her thus torturing honesty to her own advantage that she had absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach
well what is your opinion of my conduct
she said quietly
that it is unworthy of any thoughtful and meek and comely woman
in an instant bathsheba's face coloured with the angry crimson of a danby sunset
but she forbore to utter this feeling and the reticence of her tongue only made the loquacity of her face the more notice able
the next thing gabriel did was to make a mistake
perhaps you don't like the rudeness of my repri manding you for i know it is rudeness but i thought it would do good
she instantly replied sarcastically  on the contrary my opinion of you is so low that i see in your abuse the praise of discerning people
i am glad you don't mind it for i said it honestly and with every serious meaning
i see
but unfortunately when you try not to speak in jest you are amusing  just as when you wish to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a sensible word it was a hard hit but bathsheba had unmistakably lost her temper and on that account gabriel had never in his life kept his own better
he said nothing
she then broke out    i may ask i suppose where in particular my unworthiness lies
in my not marrying you perhaps
not by any means
said gabriel quietly
i have long given up thinking of that matter
or wishing it i suppose
she said and it was apparent that she expected an unhesitating denial of this supposition
whatever gabriel felt he coolly echoed her words  or wishing it either
a woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her and with a rudeness which is not offensive
bathsheba would have submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had gabriel pro tested that he was loving her at the same time the impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable even if it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the humiliation and a tenderness in the strife
this was what she had been expecting and what she had not got
to be lectured because the lecturer saw her in the cold morning light of openshuttered disillusion was exasperating
he had not finished either
he continued in a more agitated voice  my opinion is since you ask it that you are greatly to blame for playing pranks upon a man like mr boldwood merely as a pastime
leading on a man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action
and even miss everdene if you seriously inclined towards him you might have let him find it out in some way of true lovingkindness and not by sending him a valentine's letter
bathsheba laid down the shears
i cannot allow any man to  to criticise my private conduct
she exclaimed
nor will i for a minute
so you'll please leave the farm at the end of the week
it may have been a peculiarity  at any rate it was a fact  that when bathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled when by a refined emotion her upper or heavenward one
her nether lip quivered now
very well so i will
said gabriel calmly
he had been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking rather than by a chain he could not break
i should be even better pleased to go at once
he added
go at once then in heaven's name
said sheher eyes flashing at his though never meeting them
don't let me see your face any more
very well miss everdene  so it shall be
and he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity as moses left the presence of pharaoh
chapter xxi    troubles in the fold  a message   gabriel oak had ceased to feed the weatherbury flock for about fourandtwenty hours when on sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen joseph poorgrass matthew moon fray and halfadozen others came running up to the house of the mistress of the upper farm
whatever is the matter men
she said meeting them at the door just as she was coming out on her way to church and ceasing in a moment from the close compression of her two red lips with which she had accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove
sixty
said joseph poorgrass
seventy
said moon
fiftynine
said susan tall's husband 
 sheep have broke fence
said fray 
 and got into a field of young clover
said tall 
 young clover
said moon 
 clover
said joseph poorgrass
and they be getting blasted
said henery fray
that they be
said joseph
and will all die as dead as nits if they bain't got out and cured
said tall
joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern
fray's forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise after the pattern of a portcullis expressive of a double despair
laban tall's lips were thin and his face were rigid
matthew's jaws sank and his eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull them
yes
said joseph and i was sitting at home looking for ephesians and says i to myself 'tis nothing but corinthians and thessalonians in this danged testament
when who should come in but henery there joseph he said the sheep have with bathsheba it was a moment when thought was blasted theirselves     with bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech exclamation
moreover she had hardly recovered her equanimity since the disturbance which she had suffered from oak's remarks
that's enought  that's enough
 oh you fools
she cried throwing the parasol and prayerbook into the passage and running out of doors in the direction signified
to come to me and not go and get them out directly
oh the stupid numskulls
her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now
bathsheba's beauty belonged rather to the demonian than to the angelic school she never looked so well as when she was angry  and particularly when the effect was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress care fully put on before a glass
all the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the cloverfield joseph sinking down in the midst when about halfway like an individual withering in a world which was more and more insupportable
having once received the stimulus that her presence always gave them they went round among the sheep with a will
the majority of the afflicted animals were lying down and could not be stirred
these were bodily lifted out and the others driven into the adjoining field
here after the lapse of a few minutes several more fell down and lay helpless and livid as the rest
bathsheba with a sad bursting heart looked at these primest specimens of her prime flock as they rolled there  swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew
many of them foamed at the mouth their breathing being quick and short whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended
o what can i do what can i do
said bathsheba helplessly
sheep are such unfortunate animals
 there's always something happening to them
i never knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape or other
there's only one way of saving them
said tall
what way
tell me quick
they must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose
can you do it
can i
no ma'am
we can't nor you neither
it must be done in a particular spot
if ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab the ewe and kill her
not even a shepherd can do it as a rule
then they must die
she said in a resigned tone
only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way said joseph now just come up
he could cure 'em all if he were here
who is he
let's get him
shepherd oak said matthew
ah he's a clever man in talents
ah that he is so
said joseph poorgrass
true  he's the man
said laban tall
how dare you name that man in my presence
she said excitedly
i told you never to allude to him nor shall you if you stay with me
ah
she added brighten ing farmer boldwood knows
o no ma'am said matthew
two of his store ewes got into some vetches t'other day and were just like these
he sent a man on horseback here posthaste for gable and gable went and saved 'em farmer boldwood hev got the thing they do it with
'tis a holler pipe with a sharp pricker inside
isn't it joseph
ay  a holler pipe
echoed joseph
that's what 'tis
ay sure  that's the machine
chimed in henery fray reflectively with an oriental indifference to the flight of time
well burst out bathsheba don't stand there with your ayes and your sures talking at me
get somebody to cure the sheep instantly
all then stalked or in consternation to get some body as directed without any idea of who it was to be
in a minute they had vanished through the gate and she stood alone with the dying flock
never will i send for him never
she said firmly
one of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly extended itself and jumped high into the air
the leap was an astonishing one
the ewe fell heavily and lay still
bathsheba went up to it
the sheep was dead
o what shall i do  what shall i do
she again exclaimed wringing her hands
i won't send for him
no i won't
the most vigorous expression of a resolution does not always coincide with the greatest vigour of the resolution itself
it is often flung out as a sort of prop to support a decaying conviction which whilst strong required no enunciation to prove it so
the no i won't of bathsheba meant virtually i think i must
she followed her assistants through the gate and lifted her hand to one of them
laban answered to her signal
where is oak staying
across the valley at nest cottage
jump on the bay mare and ride across and say he must return instantly  that i say so
tall scrambled off to the field and in two minutes was on poll the bay barebacked and with only a halter by way of rein
he diminished down the hill
bathsheba watched
so did all the rest
tall cantered along the bridlepath through sixteen acres sheeplands middle field the flats cappel's piece shrank almost to a point crossed the bridge and ascended from the valley through springmead and whitepits on the other side
the cottage to which gabriel had retired before taking his final departure from the locality was visible as a white spot on the opposite hill backed by blue firs
bathsheba walked up and down
the men entered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb creatures by rubbing them
nothing availed
bathsheba continued walking
the horse was seen descending the hill and the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order whitepits springmead cappel's piece the flats middle field sheeplands sixteen acres
she hoped tall had had presence of mind enough to give the mare up to gabriel and return himself on foot
the rider neared them
it was tall
o what folly
said bathsheba
gabriel was not visible anywhere
perhaps he is already gone
she said
tall came into the inclosure and leapt off his face tragic as morton's after the battle of shrewsbury
well
said bathsheba unwilling to believe that her verbal lettredecachet could possibly have miscarried
he says beggars mustn't be choosers
replied laban
what
said the young farmer opening her eyes and drawing in her breath for an outburst
joseph poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle
he says he shall not come unless you request en to come civilly and in a proper manner as becomes any woman begging a favour
oh oh that's his answer
where does he get his airs
who am i then to be treated like that
shall i beg to a man who has begged to me
another of the flock sprang into the air and fell dead
the men looked grave as if they suppressed opinion
bathsheba turned aside her eyes full of tears
the strait she was in through pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer she burst out crying bitterly they all saw it and she attempted no further concealment
i wouldn't cry about it miss
said william small bury compassionately
why not ask him softer like
i'm sure he'd come then
gable is a true man in that way
bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes
o it is a wicked cruelty to me  it is  it is
she murmured
and he drives me to do what i wouldn't yes he does
 tall come indoors
after this collapse not very dignified for the head of an establishment she went into the house tall at her heels
here she sat down and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence which follow a fit of crying as a groundswell follows a storm
the note was none the less polite for being written in a hurry
she held it at a distance was about to fold it then added these words at the bottom  do not desert me gabriel
she looked a little redder in refolding it and closed her lips as if thereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in examining whether such strategy were justifiable
the note was despatched as the message had been and bathsheba waited indoors for the result
it was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the messenger's departure and the sound of the horse's tramp again outside
she could not watch this time but leaning over the old bureau at which she had written the letter closed her eyes as if to keep out both hope and fear
the case however was a promising one
gabriel was not angry he was simply neutral although her first command had been so haughty
such imperiousness would have damned a little less beauty and on the other hand such beauty would have redeemed a little less imperiousness
she went out when the horse was heard and looked up
a mounted figure passed between her and the sky and drew on towards the field of sheep the rider turning his face in receding
gabriel looked at her
it was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell distinctly opposite tales
bathsheba looked full of gratitude and she said    o gabriel how could you serve me so unkindly
such a tenderlyshaped reproach for his previous delay was the one speech in the language that he could pardon for not being commendation of his readiness now
gabriel murmured a confused reply and hastened on
she knew from the look which sentence in her note had brought him
bathsheba followed to the field
gabriel was already among the turgid prostrate forms
he had flung off his coat rolled up his shirtsleeves and taken from his pocket the instrument of salvation
it was a small tube or trochar with a lance passing down the inside and gabriel began to use it with a dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon
passing his hand over the sheep's left flank and selecting the proper point he punctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube then he suddenly withdrew the lance retaining the tube in its place
a current of air rushed up the tube forcible enough to have extinguished a candle held at the orifice
it has been said that mere ease after torment is de light for a time and the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now
fortynine operations were successfully performed
owing to the great hurry necessitated by the fargone state of some of the flock gabriel missed his aim in one case and in one only  striking wide of the mark and inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering ewe
four had died three recovered without an operation
the total number of sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves so dangerously was fiftyseven
when the loveled man had ceased from his labours bathsheba came and looked him in the face
gabriel will you stay on with me
she said smiling winningly and not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end because there was going to be another smile soon
i will
said gabriel
and she smiled on him again
chapter xxii    the great barn and the sheepshearers   men thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not making the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking good spirits when they are indispensable
gabriel lately for the first time since his prostration by misfortune had been independent in thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent  conditions which powerless without an opportunity as an opportunity without them is barren would have given him a sure lift upwards when the favourablecon junction should have occurred
but this incurable loitering beside bathsheba everdene stole his time ruinously
the spring tides were going by without floating him off and the neap might soon come which could not
it was the first day of june and the sheepshearing season culminated the landscape even to the leanest pasture being all health and colour
every green was young every pore was open and every stalk was swollen with racing currents of juice
god was palpably present in the country and the devil had gone with the world to town
flossy catkins of the later kinds fernsprouts like bishops' croziers the squareheaded moschatel the odd cuckoopint  like an apoplectic saint in a niche of malachite  snowwhite ladies'smocks the toothwort approximating to human flesh the enchanter's night shade and the blackpetaled dolefulbells were among the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about weatherbury at this teeming time and of the animal the metamorphosed figures of mr jan coggan the mastershearer the second and third shearers who travelled in the exercise of their calling and do not re quire definition by name henery fray the fourth shearer susan tall's husband the fifth joseph poorgrass the sixth young cain ball as assistantshearer and gabriel oak as general supervisor
none of these were clothed to any extent worth mentioning each appearing to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean between a high and low caste hindoo
an angularity of lineament and a fixity of facial machinery in general proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day
they sheared in the great barn called for the nonce the shearingbarn which on groundplan resembled a church with transepts
it not only emulated the form of the neighbouring church of the parish but vied with it in antiquity
whether the barn had ever formed one of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to be aware no trace of such surroundings remained
the vast porches at the sides lofty enough to admit a waggon laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf were spanned by heavypointed arches of stone broadly and boldly cut whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not apparent in erections where more ornament has been attempted
the dusky filmed chestnut roof braced and tied in by huge collars curves and diagonals was far nobler in design because more wealthy in material than ninetenths of those in our modern churches
along each side wall was a range of striding buttresses throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them which were perforated by lancet openings combining in their proportions the precise requirements both of beauty and ventilation
one could say about this barn what could hardly be said of either the church or the castle akin to it in age and style that the purpose which had dictated its original erection was the same with that to which it was still applied
unlike and superior to either of those two typical remnants of mediaevalism the old barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutila tion at the hands of time
here at least the spirit of the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern beholder
standing before this abraded pile the eye regarded its present usage the minddwelt upon its past history with a satisfied sense of functional continuity throughout  a feeling almost of gratitude and quite of pride at the permanence of the idea which had heaped it up
the fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake inspired any hatred of its purpose nor given rise to any reaction that had battered it down invested this simple grey effort of old minds with a repose if not a grandeur which a too curious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers
for once medievalism and modernism had a common stand point
the lanccolate windows the timeeaten arch stones and chamfers the orientation of the axis the misty chestnut work of the rafters referred to no exploded fortifying art or wornout religious creed
the defence and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study a religion and a desire
today the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit a bountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers' operations which was the wood threshingfloor in the centre formed of thick oak black with age and polished by the beating of flails for many generations till it had grown as slippery and as rich in hue as the stateroom floors of an elizabethan mansion
here the shearers knelt the sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts tanned arms and the polished shears they flourished causing these to bristle with a thousand rays strong enough to blind a weakeyed man
beneath them a captive sheep lay panting quickening its pants as misgiving merged in terror till it quivered like the hot landscape outside
this picture of today in its frame of four hundred years ago did not produce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast of date
in comparison with cities weatherbury was immutable
the citizen's then is the rustic's now
in london twenty or thirtyyears ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing less than a century set a mark on its face or tone
five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair
ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase
in these wessex nooks the busy out sider's ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity
so the barn was natural to the shearers and the shearers were in harmony with the barn
the spacious ends of the building answering ecclesi astically to nave and chancel extremities were fenced off with hurdles the sheep being all collected in a crowd within these two enclosures and in one angle a catching pen was formed in which three or four sheep were continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss of time
in the background mellowed by tawny shade were the three women maryann money and temperance and soberness miller gathering up the fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying them round
they were indifferently well assisted by the old maltster who when the malting season from october to april had passed made himself useful upon any of the bordering farmsteads
behind all was bathsheba carefully watching the men to see that there was no cutting or wounding through carelessness and that the animals were shorn close
gabriel who flitted and hovered under her bright eyes like a moth did not shear continuously half his time being spent in attending to the others and selecting the sheep for them
at the present moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of mild liquor supplied from a barrel in the corner and cut pieces of bread and cheese
bathsheba after throwing a glance here a caution there and lecturing one of the younger operators who had allowed his last finished sheep to go off among the flock without restamping it with her initials came again to gabriel as he put down the luncheon to drag a frightened ewe to his shearstation flinging it over upon its back with a dexterous twist of the arm he lopped off the tresses about its head and opened up the neck and collar his mistress quietly looking on she blushes at the insult
murmured bathsheba watching the pink flush which arose and overspread the neck and shoulders of the ewe where they were left bare by the clicking shears  a flush which was enviable for its delicacy by many queens of coteries and would have been creditable for its promptness to any woman in the world
poor gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content by having her over him her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears which apparently were going to gather up a piece of the flesh at every close and yet never did so
like guildenstern oak was happy in that he was not over happy
he had no wish to converse with her that his bright lady and himself formed one group exclusively their own and containing no others in the world was enough
so the chatter was all on her side
there is a loquacity that tells nothing which was bathsheba's and there is a silence which says much that was gabriel's
full of this dim and temperate bliss he went on to fling the ewe over upon her other side covering her head with his knee gradually running the shears line after line round her dewlap thence about her flank and back and finishing over the tail
well done and done quickly
said bathsheba looking at her watch as the last snip resounded
how long miss
said gabriel wiping his brow
threeandtwenty minutes and a half since you took the first lock from its forehead
it is the first time that i have ever seen one done in less than half an hour
the clean sleek creature arose from its fleece  how perfectly like aphrodite rising from the foam should have been seen to be realized  looking startled and shy at the loss of its garment which lay on the floor in one soft cloud united throughout the portion visible being the inner surface only which never before exposed was white as snow and without flaw or blemish of the minutest kind
cain ball
yes mister oak here i be
cainy now runs forward with the tarpot
b e is newly stamped upon the shorn skin and away the simple dam leaps panting over the board into the shirtless flock outside
then up comes maryann throws the loose locks into the middle of the fleece rolls it up and carries it into the background as threeandahalf pounds of unadulterated warmth for the winter enjoy ment of persons unknown and far away who will however never experience the superlative comfort derivable from the wool as it here exists new and pure   before the unctuousness of its nature whilst in a living state has dried stiffened and been washed out   rendering it just now as superior to anything woollen as cream is superior to milkandwater
but heartless circumstance could not leave entire gabriel's happiness of this morning
the rams old ewes and twoshear ewes had duly undergone their stripping and the men were proceeding with the shear lings and hogs when oak's belief that she was going to stand pleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully interrupted by farmer bold wood's appearance in the extremest corner of the barn
nobody seemed to have perceived his entry but there he certainly was
boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere of his own which everybody felt who came near him and the talk which bathsheba's presence had somewhat suppressed was now totally suspended
he crossed over towards bathsheba who turned to greet him with a carriage of perfect ease
he spoke to her in low tones and she instinctively modulated her own to the same pitch and her voice ultimately even caught the inflection of his
she was far from having a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him but woman at the impressionable age gravitates to the larger body not only in her choice of words which is apparent every day but even in her shades of tone and humour when the influence is great
what they conversed about was not audible to gabriel who was too independent to get near though too concerned to disregard
the issue of their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer to help her over the spreadingboard into the bright june sunlight outside
standing beside the sheep already shorn they went on talking again
concerning the flock
apparently not
gabriel theorized not without truth that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach of the speakers' eyes these are usually fixed upon it
bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying upon the ground in a way which suggested less ovine criticism than womanly embarrassment
she became more or less red in the cheek the blood wavering in uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space between ebb and flood
gabriel sheared on constrained and sad
she left boldwood's side and he walked up and down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour
then she reappeared in her new ridinghabit of myrtlegreen which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit and young bob coggan led on her mare boldwood fetching his own horse from the tree under which it had been tied
oak's eyes could not forsake them and in en deavouring to continue his shearing at the same time that he watched boldwood's manner he snipped the sheep in the groin
the animal plunged bathsheba instantly gazed towards it and saw the blood
o gabriel
she exclaimed with severe remon strance you who are so strict with the other men  see what you are doing yourself
to an outsider there was not much to complain of in this remark but to oak who knew bathsheba to be well aware that she herself was the cause of the poor ewe's wound because she had wounded the ewe's shearer in a  still more vital part it had a sting which the abiding sense of his inferiority to both herself and boldwood was not calculated to heal
but a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he had no longer a lover's interest in her helped him occasionally to conceal a feeling
bottle
he shouted in an unmoved voice of routine
cainy ball ran up the wound was anointed and the shearing continued
boldwood gently tossed bathsheba into the saddle and before they turned away she again spoke out to oak with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness
i am going now to see mr boldwood's leicesters
take my place in the barn gabriel and keep the men carefully to their work
the horses' heads were put about and they trotted away
boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great interest among all around him but after having been pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar of thriving bachelorship his lapse was an anticlimax somewhat resembling that of st john long's death by consumption in the midst of his proofs that it was not a fatal disease
that means matrimony
said temperance miller following them out of sight with her eyes
i reckon that's the size o't
said coggan working along without looking up
well better wed over the mixen than over the moor said laban tall turning his sheep
henery fray spoke exhibiting miserable eyes at the same time i don't see why a maid should take a husband when she's bold enough to fight her own battles and don't want a home for 'tis keeping another woman out
but let it be for 'tis a pity he and she should trouble two houses
as usual with decided characters bathsheba invari ably provoked the criticism of individuals like henery fray
her emblazoned fault was to be too pronounced in her objections and not sufficiently overt in her likings
we learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb but those which they reject that give them the colours they are known by and win the same way people are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms whilst their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all
henery continued in a more complaisant mood  i once hinted my mind to her on a few things as nearly as a battered frame dared to do so to such a froward piece
you all know neighbours what a man i be and how i come down with my powerful words when my pride is boiling wi' scarn
we do we do henery
so i said  mistress everdene there's places empty and there's gifted men willing but the spite  no
not the spite  i didn't say spite  but the villainy of the contrarikind
i said meaning womankind  keeps 'em out
that wasn't too strong for her say
passably well put
yes and i would have said it had death and salvation overtook me for it
such is my spirit when i have a mind
a true man and proud as a lucifer
you see the artfulness
why 'twas about being baily really but i didn't put it so plain that she could understand my meaning so i could lay it on all the stronger
that was my depth

however let her marry an she will
perhaps 'tis high time
i believe farmer boldwood kissed her behind the spearbed at the sheepwashing t'other day  that i do
what a lie
said gabriel
ah neighbour oak  how'st know
said henery mildly
because she told me all that passed
said oak with a pharisaical sense that he was not as other shearers in this matter
ye have a right to believe it
said henery with dudgeon a very true right
but i mid see a little distance into things
to be longheaded enough for a baily's place is a poor mere trifle  yet a trifle more than nothing
however i look round upon life quite cool
do you heed me neighbours
my words though made as simple as i can mid be rather deep for some heads
o yes henery we quite heed ye
a strange old piece goodmen  whirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing
a little warped too
but i have my depths ha and even my great depths
i might gird at a certain shepherd brain to brain
but no  o no
a strange old piece ye say
interposed the maltster in a querulous voice
at the same time ye be no old man worth naming  no old man at all
yer teeth bain't  half  gone  yet and what's a old  man's standing if se be his teeth bain't gone
weren't i stale in wedlock afore ye were out of arms
'tis a poor thing to be sixty when there's people far past fourscore  a boast'weak as water
it was the unvaying custom in weatherbury to sink minor differences when the maltster had to be pacified
weak aswater
yes
said jan coggan malter we feel ye to be a wonderful veteran man and nobody can gainsay it
nobody
said joseph poorgrass
ye be a very rare old  spectacle malter and we all admire ye for that gift 
ay and as a young man when my senses were in prosperity i was likewise liked by a goodfew who knowed me
said the maltster
'ithout doubt you was  'ithout doubt
the bent and hoary 'man was satisfied and so apparently was henery frag
that matters should continue pleasant maryann spoke who what with her brown complexion and the working wrapper of rusty linsey had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch in oils  notably some of nicholas poussin's  do anybody know of a crooked man or a lame or any secondhand fellow at all that would do for poor me
said maryann
a perfect one i don't expect to  at my time of life
if i could hear of such a thing twould do me more good than toast and ale
coggan furnished a suitable reply
oak went on with his shearing and said not another word
pestilent moods had come and teased away his quiet
bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him above his fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm imperatively required
he did not covet the post relatively to the farm  in relation to herself as beloved by him and unmarried to another he had coveted it
his readings of her seemed now to be vapoury and indistinct
his lecture to her was he thought one of the absurdest mistakes
far from coquetting with boldwood she had trifled with himself in thus feigning that she had trifled with another
he was inwardly convinced that in accordance with the anticipations of his easygoing and worseeducated comrades that day would see boldwood the accepted husband of miss everdene
gabriel at this time of his life had out grown the instinctive dislike which every christian boy has for reading the bible perusing it now quite frequently and he inwardly said i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets
this was mere exclamation  the froth of the storm
he adored bathsheba just the same
we workfolk shall have some lordly junketing tonight
said cainy ball casting forth his thoughts in a new direction
this morning i see'em making the great puddens in the milkingpails  lumps of fat as big as yer thumb mister oak
i've never seed such splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my life  they never used to be bigger then a horsebean
and there was a great black crock upon the brandish with his legs asticking out but i don't know what was in within
and there's two bushels of biffins for applepies said maryann
well i hope to do my duty by it all
said joseph poorgrass in a pleasant masticating manner of anticipa tion
yes victuals and drink is a cheerful thing and gives nerves to the nerveless if the form of words may be used
'tis the gospel of the body without which we perish so to speak it
chapter xxiii    eventide  a second declaration   for the shearingsupper a long table was placed on the grassplot beside the house the end of the table being thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a foot or two into the room
miss everdene sat inside the window facing down the table
she was thus at the head without mingling with the men
this evening bathsheba was unusually excited her red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair
she seemed to expect assistance and the seat at the bottom of the table was at her request left vacant until after they had begun and the duties appertaining to that end which he did with great readiness
at this moment mr boldwood came in at the gate and crossed the green to bathsheba at the window
he apologized for his lateness  his arrival was evidently by arrangement
gabriel
said she  will you move again please and let mr boldwood come there
oak moved in silence back to his original seat
the gentlemanfarmer was dressed in cheerful style in a new coat and white waistcoat quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey
inwardy too he was blithe and consequently chatty to an exceptional degree
so also was bathsheba now that he had come though the uninvited presence of pennyways the bailiff who had been dismissed for theft disturbed her equan imity for a while
supper being ended coggan began on his own private account without reference to listeners   l've lost my love and l care not i've lost my love and l care not i shall soon have another that's better than t'other
i've lost my love and i care not
this lyric when concluded was received with a silently appreciative gaze at the table implying that the performance like a work by those established authors who are independent of notices in the papers was a wellknown delight which required no applause
now master poorgrass your song
said coggan
i be all but in liquor and the gift is wanting in me
said joseph diminishing himself
nonsense wou'st never be so ungrateful joseph  never
said coggan expressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice
and mistress is looking hard at ye as much as to say sing at once joseph poor grass
faith so she is well i must suffer it
 just eye my features and see if the telltale blood overheats me much neighbours
no yer blushes be quite reasonable
said coggan
i always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty's eyes get fixed on me
said joseph differently but if so be 'tis willed they do they must
now joseph your song please
said bathsheba from the window
well really ma'am
he replied in a yielding tone i don't know what to say
it would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure
hear hear
said the supperparty
poorgrass thus assured trilled forth a flickering yet commendable piece of sentiment the tune of which consisted of the keynote and another the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon
this was so successful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath after a few false starts   i sow'ed th'e i sow'ed i sow'ed the'e seeds' of love' iit was' all' i'in the'e spring' iin a'pril' ma'ay a'nd sun'ny' june' when sma'all bi'irds they' do' sing
well put out of hand
said coggan at the end of the verse
they do sing' was a very taking paragraph
ay and there was a pretty place at seeds of love
and 'twas well heaved out
though love  is a nasty high corner when a man's voice is getting crazed
next verse master poorgrass
but during this rendering young bob coggan ex hibited one of those anomalies which will afflict little people when other persons are particularly serious  in trying to check his laughter he pushed down his throat as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of when after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time his mirth burst out through his nose
joseph perceived it and with hectic cheeks of indignation instantly ceased singing
coggan boxed bob's ears immediately
go on joseph  go on and never mind the young scamp
said coggan
'tis a very catching ballet
now then again  the next bar i'll help ye to flourish up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy   o the wi'illo'ow tree' will' twist' and the wil'low' tre'ee wi'ill twine'
but the singer could not be set going again
bob coggan was sent home for his ill manners and tran quility was restored by jacob smallbury who volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which the worthy toper old silenus amused on a similar occasion the swains chromis and mnasylus and other jolly dogs of his day
it was still the beaming time of evening though night was stealthily making itself visible low down upon the ground the western lines of light taking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent or illuminating the dead levels at all
the sun had crept round the tree as a last effort before death and then began to sink the shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight whilst their heads and shoulders were still enjoying day touched with a yellow of self sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than acquired
the sun went down in an ochreous mist but they sat and talked on and grew as merry as the gods in homer's heaven
bathsheba still remained enthroned inside the window and occupied herself in knitting from which she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene outside
the slow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely before the signs of moving were shown
gabriel suddenly missed farmer boldwood from his place at the bottom of the table
how long he had been gone oak did not know but he had apparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk
whilst he was thinking of this liddy brought candles into the back part of the room overlooking the shearers and their lively new flames shone down the table and over the men and dispersed among the green shadows behind
bathsheba's form still in its original position was now again distinct between their eyes and the light which revealed that boldwood had gone inside the room and was sitting near her
next came the question of the evening
would miss everdene sing to them the song she always sang so charmingly   the banks of allan water  before they went home
after a moment's consideration bathsheba assented beckoning to gabriel who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere
have you brought your flute 
she whispered
yes miss
play to my singing then
she stood up in the windowopening facing the men the candles behind her gabriel on her right hand immediately outside the sashframe
boldwood had drawn up on her left within the room
her singing was soft and rather tremulous at first but it soon swelled to a steady clearness
subsequent events caused one of the verses to be remembered for many months and even years by more than one of those who were gathered there   for his bride a soldier sought her and a winning tongue had he on the banks of allan water none was gay as she
in addition to the dulcet piping of gabriel's flute boldwood supplied a bass in his customary profound voice uttering his notes so softly however as to abstain entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of the song they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow which threw her tones into relief
the shearers reclined against each other as at suppers in the early ages of the world and so silent and absorbed were they that her breathing could almost be heard between the bars and at the end of the ballad when the last tone loitered on to an inexpressible close there arose that buzz of pleasure which is the attar of applause
it is scarcely necessary to state that gabriel could not avoid noting the farmer's bearing tonight towards their entertainer
yet there was nothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to his time of performing them
it was when the rest were all looking away that boldwood observed her when they regarded her he turned aside when they thanked or praised he was silent when they were inattentive he murmured his thanks
the meaning lay in the difference between actions none of which had any meaning of itself and the necessity of being jealous which lovers are troubled with did not lead oak to underestimate these signs
bathsheba then wished them goodnight withdrew from the window and retired to the back part of the room boldwood thereupon closing the sash and the shutters and remaining inside with her
oak wandered away under the quiet and scented trees
recovering from the softer impressions produced by bathsheba's voice the shearers rose to leave coggan turning to pennyways as he pushed back the bench to pass out   i like to give praise where praise is due and the man deserves it  that 'a do so
he remarked looking at the worthy thief as if he were the masterpiece of some worldrenowned artist
i'm sure i should never have believed it if we hadn't proved it so to allude hiccupped joseph poorgrass that every cup every one of the best knives and forks and every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as at the beginning and not one stole at all
i'm sure i don't deserve half the praise you give me
said the virtuous thief grimly
well i'll say this for pennyways
added coggan that whenever he do really make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good action as i could see by his face he
did tonight afore sitting down he's generally able to carry it out
yes i'm proud to say
neighbours that he's stole nothing at all
well
 'tis an honest deed and we thank ye for it pennyways
said joseph to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed unanimously
at this time of departure when nothing more was visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between the shutters a passionate scene was in course of enactment there
miss everdene and boldwood were alone
her cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from the very seriousness of her position but her eye was bright with the excitement of a triumph  though it was a triumph which had rather been contemplated than desired
she was standing behind a low armchair from which she had just risen and he was kneeling in it  inclining himself over its back towards her and holding her hand in both his own
his body moved restlessly and it was with what keats daintily calls a too happy happiness
this unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from a man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component was in its distressing incongruity a pain to her which quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the proof that she was idolized
i will try to love you
she was saying in a trembling voice quite unlike her usual selfconfidence
and if i can believe in any way that i shall make you a good wife i shall indeed be willing to marry you
but mr boldwood hesitation on so high a matter is honourable in any woman and i don't want to give a solemn promise tonight
i would rather ask you to wait a few weeks till i can see my situation better
but you have every reason to believe that then     i have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or six weeks between this time and harvest that you say you are going to be away from home i shall be able to promise to be your wife
she said firmly
but remember this distinctly i don't promise yet
it is enough i don't ask more
i can wait on those dear words
and now miss everdene good night
goodnight
she said graciously  almost tenderly and boldwood withdrew with a serene smile
bathsheba knew more of him now he had entirely bared his heart before her even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without the feathers that make it grand
she had been awe struck at her past temerity and was struggling to make amends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved the penalty she was schooling herself to pay
to have brought all this about her ears was terrible but after a while the situation was not without a fearful joy
the facility with which even the most timid woman some times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated with a little triumph is marvellous
chapter xxiv    the same night  the fir plantation   among the multifarious duties which bathsheba had voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the services of a bailiff was the particular one of looking round the homestead before going to bed to see that all was right and safe for the night
gabriel had almost constantly preceded her in this tour every evening watching her affairs as carefully as any specially appointed officer of surveillance could have done but this tender devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistress and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly received
women are never tired of bewailing man's fickleness in love but they only seem to snub his con stancy
as watching is best done invisibly she usually carried a dark lantern in her hand and every now and then turned on the light to examine nooks and corners with the coolness of a metropolitan policeman
this cool ness may have owed its existence not so much to her fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from the suspicion of any her worst anticipated discovery being that a horse might not be well bedded the fowls not all in or a door not closed
this night the buildings were inspected as usual and she went round to the farm paddock
here the only sounds disturbing the stillness were steady munch ings of many mouths and stentorian breathings from all but invisible noses ending in snores and puffs like the blowing of bellows slowly
then the munching would recommence when the lively imagination might assist the eye to discern a group of pinkwhite nostrils shaped as caverns and very clammy and humid on their sur faces not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got used to them the mouths beneath having a great partiality for closing upon any loose end of bathsheba's apparel which came within reach of their tongues
above each of these a still keener vision suggested a brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly eyes and above all a pair of whitish crescentshaped horns like two particularly new moons an occasional stolid  moo
proclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt that these phenomena were the features and persons of daisy whitefoot bonnylass jollyo spot twinkleeye etc etc
 the respectable dairy of devon cows belonging to bathsheba aforesaid
her way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of tapering firs which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north wind
by reason of the density of the interwoven foliage overhead it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide twilight in the evening dark as midnight at dusk and black as the ninth plague of egypt at midnight
to describe the spot is to call it a vast low naturally formed hall the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender pillars of living wood the floor being covered with a soft dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones with a tuft of grassblades here and there
this bit of the path was always the crux of the night's ramble though before starting her apprehen sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to take a companion
slipping along here covertly as time bathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps enter ing the track at the opposite end
it was certainly a rustle of footsteps
her own instantly fell as gently as snowflakes
she reassured herself by a remembrance that the path was public and that the traveller was probably some villager returning home regetting at the same time that the meeting should be about to occur in the darkest point of her route even though only just outside her own door
the noise approached came close and a figure was apparently on the point of gliding past her when some thing tugged at her skirt and pinned it forcibly to the ground
the instantaneous check nearly threw bath sheba off her balance
in recovering she struck against warm clothes and buttons
a rum start upon my soul
said a masculine voice a foot or so above her head
have i hurt you mate
no
said bathsheba attempting to shrink a way
we have got hitched together somehow i think
yes
are you a woman
yes
a lady i should have said
it doesn't matter
i am a man
oh
bathsheba softly tugged again but to no purpose
is that a dark lantern you have
i fancy so
said the man
yes
if you'll allow me i'll open it and set you free
a hand seized the lantern the door was opened the rays burst out from their prison and bathsheba beheld her position with astonishment
the man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scarlet
he was a soldier
his sudden appearance was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet is to silense
gloom the genius loci at all times hitherto was now totally overthrown less by the lanternlight than by what the lantern lighted
the contrast of this revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the effect of a fairy transformation
it was immediately apparent that the military man's spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated the skirt of her dress
he caught a view of her face
i'll unfasten you in one moment miss
he said with newborn gallantry
o no  i can do it thank you
she hastily replied and stooped for the performance
the unfastening was not such a trifling affair
the rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp cords in those few moments that separation was likely to be a matter of time
he too stooped and the lantern standing on the ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side among the firtree needles and the blades of long damp grass with the effect of a large glowworm
it radiated upwards into their faces and sent over half the planta tion gigantic shadows of both man and woman each dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the treetrunks till it wasted to nothing
he looked hard into her eyes when she raised them for a moment bathsheba looked down again for his gaze was too strong to be received pointblank with her own
but she had obliquely noticed that he was young and slim and that he wore three chevrons upon his sleeve
bathsheba pulled again
you are a prisoner miss it is no use blinking the matter
said the soldier drily
i must cut your dress if you are in such a hurry
yes  please do
she exclaimed helplessly 
it wouldn't be necessary if you could wait a moment and he unwound a cord from the little wheel
she withdrew her own hand but whether by accident or design he touched it
bathsheba was vexed she hardly knew why
his unravelling went on but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end
she looked at him again
thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face
said the young sergeant without ceremony
she coloured with embarrassment
'twas un willingly shown
she replied stiffly and with as much dignity  which was very little  as she could infuse into a position of captivity i like you the better for that incivility miss
he said
i should have liked  i wish  you had never shown yourself to me by intruding here
she pulled again and the gathers of her dress began to give way like liliputian musketry
i deserve the chastisement your words give me
but why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such an aversion to her father's sex
go on your way please
what beauty and drag you after me
do but look i never saw such a tangle
o 'tis shameful of you you have been making it worse on purpose to keep me here  you have
indeed i don't think so
said the sergeant with a merry twinkle
i tell you you have
she exclaimed in high temper
i insist upon undoing it
now allow me
certainly miss i am not of steel
he added a sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh could possess without losing its nature altogether
i am thankful for beauty even when 'tis thrown to me like a bone to a dog
these moments will be over too soon
she closed her lips in a determined silence
bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate rush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her
the thought was too dreadful
the dress  which she had put on to appear stately at the supper  was the head and front of her wardrobe not another in her stock became her so well
what woman in bathsheba's position not naturally timid and within call of her retainers would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear a price
all in good time it will soon be done i perceive said her cool friend
this trifling provokes and  and     not too cruel
  insults me
it is done in order that i may have the pleasure of apologizing to so charming a woman which i straightway do most humbly madam
he said bowing low
bathsheba really knew not what to say
i've seen a good many women in my time continued the young man in a murmur and more thoughtfully than hitherto critically regarding her bent head at the same time but i've never seen a woman so beautiful as you
take it or leave it  be offended or like it  i don't care
who are you then who can so well afford to despise opinion
no stranger
sergeant troy
i am staying in this place
 there
it is undone at last you see
your light fingers were more eager than mine
i wish it had been the knot of knots which there's no untying
this was worse and worse
she started up and so did he
how to decently get away from him  that was her difficulty now
she sidled off inch by inch the lantern in her hand till she could see the redness of his coat no longer
ah beauty goodbye
he said
she made no reply and reaching a distance of twenty or thirty yards turned about and ran indoors
liddy had just retired to rest
in ascending to her own chamber bathsheba opened the girl's door an inch or two and panting said  liddy is any soldier staying in the village  sergeant somebody  rather gentlemanly for a sergeant and good looking  a red coat with blue facings
no miss  no i say but really it might be sergeant troy home on furlough though i have not seen him
he was here once in that way when the regiment was at casterbridge
yes that's the name
had he a moustache  no whiskers or beard
he had
what kind of a person is he
o
miss  i blush to name it  a gay man
but i know him to be very quick and trim who might have made his thousands like a squire
such a clever young dandy as he is
he's a doctor's son by name which is a great deal and he's an earl's son by nature
which is a great deal more
fancy
is it true
yes
and he was brought up so well and sent to casterbridge grammar school for years and years
learnt all languages while he was there and it was said he got on so far that he could take down chinese in shorthand but that i don't answer for as it was only reported
however he wasted his gifted lot and listed a soldier but even then he rose to be a sergeant without trying at all
ah
such a blessing it is to be highborn nobility of blood will shine out even in the ranks and files
and is he really come home miss
i believe so
goodnight liddy
after all how could a cheerful wearer of skirts be permanently offended with the man
there are occasions when girls like bathsheba will put up with a great deal of unconventional behaviour
when they want to be praised which is often when they want to be mastered which is sometimes and when they want no nonsense which is seldom
just now the first feeling was in the ascendant with bathsheba with a dash of the second
moreover by chance or by devilry the ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better days
so she could not clearly decide whether it was her opinion that he had insulted her or not 
was ever anything so odd
she at last exclaimed to herself in her own room
and was ever anything so meanly done as what i did do to sulk away like that from a man who was only civil and kind
clearly she did not think his barefaced praise of her person an insult now
it was a fatal omission of boldwood's that he had never once told her she was beautiful
chapter xxv    the new acquaintance described   idiosyncrasy and vicissitude had combined to stamp sergeant troy as an exceptional being
he was a man to whom memories were an in cumbrance and anticipations a superfluity
simply feeling considering and caring for what was before his eyes he was vulnerable only in the present
his out look upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then  that projection of consciousness into days gone by and to come which makes the past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word for circum spection was foreign to troy
with him the past was yesterday the future tomorrow never the day after
on this account he might in certain lights have been regarded as one of the most fortunate of his order
for it may be argued with great plausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease and that expectation in its only comfortable form  that of absolute faith  is practically an impossibility whilst in the form of hope and the secondary compounds patience impatience resolve curiosity it is a constant fluctuation between pleasure and pain
sergeant troy being entirely innocent of the practice of expectation was never disappointed
to set against this negative gain there may have been some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the higher tastes and sensations which it entailed
but limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss by the loser therefrom  in this attribute moral or aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material since those who suffer do not mind it whilst those who mind it soon cease to suffer
it is not a denial of anything to have been always without it and what troy had never enjoyed he did not miss but being fully conscious that what sober people missed he enjoyed his capacity though really less seemed greater than theirs
he was moderately truthful towards men but to women lied like a cretan  a system of ethics above all others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of admission into lively society and the possibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference only to the future
he never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the ugly and hence though his morals had hardly been applauded disapproval of them had fre quently been tempered with a smile
this treatment had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other men's gallantries to his own aggrandizement as a corinthian rather than to the moral profit of his hearers
his reason and his propensities had seldom any reciprocating influence having separated by mutual consent long ago  thence it sometimes happened that while his intentions were as honourable as could be wished any particular deed formed a dark background which threw them into fine relief
the sergeant's vicious phases being the offspring of impulse and his virtuous phases of cool meditation the latter had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen
troy was full of activity but his activities were less of a locomotive than a vegetative nature and never being based upon any original choice of foundation or direc tion they were exercised on whatever object chance might place in their way
hence whilst he sometimes reached the brilliant in speech because that was spontaneous he fell below the commonplace in action from inability to guide incipient effort
he had a quick comprehension and considerable force of char acter but being without the power to combine them the comprehension became engaged with trivialities whilst waiting for the will to direct it and the force wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the comprehension
he was a fairly welleducated man for one of middle class  exceptionally well educated for a common soldier
he spoke fluently and unceasingly
he could in this way be one thing and seem another  for instance he could speak of love and think of dinner call on the intend to owe
the wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by many people almost as automatically as they repeat a proverb or say that they are christians and the like without thinking much of the enormous corollaries which spring from the proposition
still less is it acted upon for the good of the complemental being alluded to
with the majority such an opinion is shelved with all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home
when expressed with some amount of reflectiveness it seems coordinate with a belief that this flattery must be reasonable to be effective
it is to the credit of men that few attempt to settle the question by experi ment and it is for their happiness perhaps that accident has never settled it for them
nevertheless that a male dissembler who by deluging her with untenable fictions charms the female wisely may acquire powers reaching to the extremity of perdition is a truth taught to many by unsought and wringing occurrences
and some profess to have attained to the same knowledge by experiment as aforesaid and jauntily continue their indulgence in such experiments with terrible effect
sergeant troy was one
he had been known to observe casually that in dealing with womankind the only alternative to flattery was cursing and swearing
there was no third method
treat them fairly and you are a lost man
he would say
this philosopher's public appearance in weatherbury promptly followed his arrival there
a week or two after the shearing bathsheba feeling a nameless relief of spirits on account of boldwood's absence approached her hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the haymakers
they consisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and flexuous forms the former being the men the latter the women who wore tilt bonnets covered with nankeen which hung in a curtain upon their shoulders
coggan and mark clark were mowing in a less forward meadow clark humming a tune to the strokes of his scythe to which jan made no attempt to keep time with his
in the first mead they were already loading hay the women raking it into cocks and windrows and the men tossing it upon the waggon
from behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot emerged and went on loading unconcernedly with the rest
it was the gallant sergeant who had come hay making for pleasure and nobody could deny that he was doing the mistress of the farm real knightservice by this voluntary contribution of his labour at a busy time
as soon as she had entered the field troy saw her and sticking his pitchfork into the ground and picking up his crop or cane he came forward
bathsheba blushed with halfangry embarrassment and adjusted her eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her path
chapter xxvi    scene on the verge of the haymead   ah miss everdene
said the sergeant touching his diminutive cap
little did i think it was you i was speaking to the other night
and yet if i had reflected the queen of the cornmarket truth is truth at any hour of the day or night and i heard you so named in casterbridge yesterday the queen of the cornmarket
i say could be no other woman
i step across now to beg your forgiveness a thousand times for having been led by my feelings to express myself too strongly for a stranger
to be sure i am no stranger to the place  i am sergeant troy as i told you and i have assisted your uncle in these fields no end of times when i was a lad
i have been doing the same for you today
i suppose i must thank you for that sergeant troy
said the queen of the cornmarket in an in differently grateful tone
the sergeant looked hurt and sad
indeed you must not miss everdene
he said
why could you think such a thing necessary
i am glad it is not
why
if i may ask without offence
because i don't much want to thank you for any thing
i am afraid i have made a hole with my tongue that my heart will never mend
o these intolerable times that illluck should follow a man for honestly telling a woman she is beautiful
'twas the most i said  you must own that and the least i could say  that i own myself
there is some talk i could do without more easily than money
indeed
that remark is a sort of digression
no
it means that i would rather have your room than your company
and i would rather have curses from you than kisses from any other woman so i'll stay here
bathsheba was absolutely speechless
and yet she could not help feeling that the assistance he was render ing forbade a harsh repulse
well
continued troy i suppose there is a praise which is rudeness and that may be mine
at the same time there is a treatment which is injustice and that may be yours
because a plain blunt man who has never been taught concealment speaks out his mind without exactly intending it he's to be snapped off like the son of a sinner
indeed there's no such case between us
she said turning away
i don't allow strangers to be bold and impudent  even in praise of me
ah  it is not the fact but the method which offends you
he said carelessly
but i have the sad satis faction of knowing that my words whether pleasing or offensive are unmistakably true
would you have had me look at you and tell my acquaintance that you are quite a commonplace woman to save you the embar rassment of being stared at if they come near you
not i i couldn't tell any such ridiculous lie about a beauty to encourage a single woman in england in too excessive a modesty
it is all pretence  what you are saying
exclaimed bathsheba laughing in spite of herself at the sergeant's sly method
you have a rare invention sergeant troy
why couldn't you have passed by me that night and said nothing
 that was all i meant to reproach you for
because i wasn't going to
half the pleasure of a feeling lies in being able to express it on the spur of the moment and i let out mine
it would have been just the same if you had been the reverse person  ugly and old  i should have exclaimed about it in the same way 
how long is it since you have been so afflicted with strong feeling then
oh ever since i was big enough to know loveliness from deformity
'tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you speak of doesn't stop at faces but extends to morals as well 
i won't speak of morals or religion  my own or anybody else's
though perhaps i should have been a very good christian if you pretty women hadn't made me an idolater
bathsheba moved on to hide the irrepressible dimp lings of merriment
troy followed whirling his crop
but  miss everdene  you do forgive me
hardly 
why
you say such things
i said you were beautiful and i'll say so still for by   so you are
the most beautiful ever i saw or may i fall dead this instant
why upon my     don't  don't
i won't listen to you  you are so profane
she said in a restless state between distress at hearing him and a penchant to hear more
i again say you are a most fascinating woman
there's nothing remarkable in my saying so is there
i'm sure the fact is evident enough
miss everdene my opinion may be too forcibly let out to please you and for the matter of that too insignificant to convince you but surely it is honest and why can't it be ex cused 
because it  it isn't a correct one
she femininely murmured
o fie  fie
am i any worse for breaking the third of that terrible ten than you for breaking the ninth
well it doesn't seem quite true to me that i am fascinating
she replied evasively
not so to you  then i say with all respect that if so it is owing to your modesty miss everdene
but surely you must have been told by everybody of what everybody notices
and you should take their words for it
they don't say so exactly
o yes they must
well i mean to my face as you do
she went on allowing herself to be further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously forbidden
but you know they think so
no  that is  i certainly have heard liddy say they do but    she paused
capitulation  that was the purport of the simple reply guarded as it was  capitulation unknown to her self
never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a more perfect meaning
the careless sergeant smiled within himself and probably too the devil smiled from a loophole in tophet for the moment was the turning point of a career
her tone and mien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the foundation had taken root in the chink  the remainder was a mere question of time and natural changes
there the truth comes out
said the soldier in reply
never tell me that a young lady can live in a buzz of admiration without knowing something about it
ah
well miss everdene you are  pardon my blunt way  you are rather an injury to our race than other wise
how  indeed
she said opening her eyes
o it is true enough
i may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb an old country saying not of much account but it will do for a rough soldier and so i will speak my mind regardless of your pleasure and without hoping or intending to get your pardon
why miss everdene it is in this manner that your good looks may do more
harm than good in the world
the sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac ion
probably some one man on an average falls in love with each ordinary woman
she can marry him he is content and leads a useful life
such women as you a hundred men always covet  your eyes will be witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you you can only marry one of that many
out of these say twenty will endeavour to
drown the bitterness of espised love in drink twenty more will mope away their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in he world because they have no ambition apart from their attachment to you twenty more  the susceptible person myself possibly among them  will be always draggling after you getting where they may just see you doing desperate things
men are such constant fools
the rest may try to get over their passion with more or less success
but all these men will be saddened
and not only those ninetynine men but the ninetynine women they might have married are saddened with them
there's my tale
that's why i say that a woman so charming as yourself miss ever dene is hardly a blessing to her race
the handsome sergeant's features were during this speech as rigid and stern as john knox's in addressing his gay young queen
seeing she made no reply he said do you read french
no i began but when i got to the verbs father died
she said simply
i do  when i have an opportunity which latterly has not been often my mother was a parisienne  and there's a proverb they have qui aime bien chatie bien   he chastens who loves well
do you understand me
ah
she replied and there was even a little tremu lousness in the usually cool girl's voice if you can only fight half as winningly as you can talk you are able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound
and then poor bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this admission in hastily trying to retrieve it she went from bad to worse
don't however suppose that i derive any pleasure from what you tell me
i know you do not  i know it perfectly
said troy with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face and altering the expression to moodiness when a dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you and give the admiration you deserve without adding the warning you need it stands to reason that my poor roughandready mixture of praise and blame cannot convey much pleasure
fool as i may be i am not so conceited as to suppose that
i think you  are conceited nevertheless
said bathsheba looking askance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand having lately grown feverish under the soldier's system of procedure  not because the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived but because its vigour was overwhelming
i would not own it to anybody else  nor do i exactly to you
still there might have been some self conceit in my foolish supposition the other night
i knew that what i said in admiration might be an opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure but i certainly did think that the kindness of your nature might prevent you judging an uncontrolled tongue harshly  which you have done  and thinking badly of me and wounding me this morning when i am working hard to save your hay
well you need not think more of that perhaps you did not mean to be rude to me by speaking out your mind indeed i believe you did not
said the shrewd woman in painfully innocent earnest
and i thank you for giving help here
but  but mind you don't speak to me again in that way or in any other unless i speak to you
o miss bathsheba
that is to hard
no it isn't
why is it
you will never speak to me for i shall not be here long
i am soon going back again to the miser able monotony of drill  and perhaps our regiment will be ordered out soon
and yet you take away the one little ewelamb of pleasure that i have in this dull life of mine
well perhaps generosity is not a woman's most marked characteristic
when are you going from here
she asked with some interest
in a month
but how can it give you pleasure to speak to me
can you ask miss everdene  knowing as you do   what my offence is based on
i you do care so much for a silly trifle of that kind then i don't mind doing it
she uncertainly and doubtingly answered
but you can't really care for a word from me
you only say so  i think you only say so
that's unjust  but i won't repeat the remark
i am too gratified to get such a mark of your friendship at any price to cavil at the tone
i do miss everdene care for it
you may think a man foolish to want a mere word   just a good morning
perhaps he is  i don't know
but you have never been a man looking upon a woman and that woman yourself
well
then you know nothing of what such an experience is like  and heaven forbid that you ever should
nonsense flatterer
what is it like
i am interested in knowing
put shortly it is not being able to think hear or look in any direction except one without wretchedness nor there without torture
ah sergeant it won't do  you are pretending
she said shaking her head
your words are too dashing to be true
i am not upon the honour of a soldier but why is it so
 of course i ask for mere pas time
because you are so distracting  and i am so distracted 
you look like it
i am indeed
why you only saw me the other night
that makes no difference
the lightning works in stantaneously
i loved you then at once  as i do now
bathsheba surveyed him curiously from the feet upward as high as she liked to venture her glance which was not quite so high as his eyes
you cannot and you dont she said demurely
there isno such sudden feeling in people
i won't listen to you any longer
hear me i wish i knew what o'clock it is  i am going  i have wasted too much time here already
the sergeant looked at his watch and told her
what haven't you a watch miss
he inquired
i have not just at present  i am about to get a new one
no
you shall be given one
yes  you  shall
a gift miss everdene  a gift
and before she knew what the young  man was intending a heavy gold watch was in her hand
it is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess
he quietly said
that watch has a history
press the spring and open the back
she did so
what do you see
a crest and a motto
a coronet with five points and beneath cedit amor rebus  love yields to circumstance
it's the motto of the earls of severn
that watch belonged to the last lord and was given to my mother's husband a medical man for his use till i came of age when it was to be given to me
it was all the fortune that ever i inherited
that watch has regulated imperial interests in its time  the stately ceremonial the courtly assigna tion pompous travels and lordly sleeps
now it is yours
but sergeant troy i cannot take this  i cannot
she exclaimed with roundeyed wonder
a gold watch
what are you doing
don't be such a dissembler
the sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his gift which she held out persistently towards him
bathsheba followed as he retired
keep it  do miss everdene  keep it
said the erratic child of impulse
the fact of your possessing it makes it worth ten times as much to me
a more plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well and the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats against  well i won't speak of that
it is in far worthier hands than ever it has been in before
but indeed i can't have it
she said in a perfect simmer of distress
o how can you do such a thing that is if you really mean it
give me your dead father's watch and such a valuable one
you should not be so reckless indeed sergeant troy
i loved my father good but better i love you more
that's how i can do it
said the sergeant with an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it
was evidently not all acted now
her beauty which whilst it had been quiescent he had praised in jest had in its animated phases moved him to earnest and though his seriousness was less than she imagined it was probably more than he imagined himself
bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment and she said in halfsuspicious accents of feeling can it be
o how can it be that you care for me and so suddenly
you have seen so little of me i may not be really so  so nicelooking as i seem to you
please do take it o do
i cannot and will not have it
believe me your generosity is too great
i have never done you a single kindness and why should you be so kind to me
a factitious reply had been again upon his lips but it was again suspended and he looked at her with an arrested eye
the truth was that as she now stood  excited wild and honest as the day   her alluring beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in advancing them as false
he said mechanically ah why
and continued to look at her
and my workfolk see me following you about the field and are wondering
o this is dreadful
she went on unconscious of the transmutation she was effecting
i did not quite mean you to accept it at first for it as my one poor patent of nobility
he broke out bluntly but upon my soul i wish you would now
without any shamming come
don't deny me the happiness of wearing it for my sake
but you are too lovely even to care to be kind as others are
no no dont say so
i have reasons for reserve which i cannot explain
bet it be then let it be
he said receiving back the watch at last i must be leaving you now
and will you speak to me for these few weeks of my stay
indeed i will
yet i don't know if i will
o why did you come and disturb me so
perhaps in setting a gin i have caught myself
such things have happened
well will you let me work in your fields
he coaxed
yes i suppose so if it is any pleasure to you
miss everdene i thank you
no no
goodbye
the sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the slope of his head saluted and returned to the distant group of haymakers
bathsheba could not face the haymakers now
her heart erratically flitting hither and thither from per plexed excitement hot and almost tearful she retreated homeward murmuring o what have i done
what does it mean
i wish i knew how much of it was true
chapter xxvii    hiving the bees   the weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this year
it was in the latter part of june and the day after the interview with troy in the hayfield that bathsheba was standing in her garden watching a swarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place
not only were they late this year but unruly
sometimes through out a whole season all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable bough  such as part of a currantbush or espalier appletree next year they would with just the same unanimity make straight off to the uppermost member of some tall gaunt costard or quarrenden and there defy all invaders who did not come armed with ladders and staves to take them
this was the case at present
bathsheba's eyes shaded by one hand were following the ascending multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue till they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees spoken of
a process somewhat analogous to that of alleged formations of the universe time and times ago was observable
the bustling swarm had swept the sky in a scattered and uniform haze which now thickened to a nebulous centre this glided on to a bough and grew still denser till it formed a solid black spot upon the light
the men and women being all busily engaged in saving the hay  even liddy had left the house for the purpose of lending a hand  bathsheba resolved to hive the bees herself if possible
she had dressed the hive with herbs and honey fetched a ladder brush and crook made herself impregnable with armour of leather gloves straw hat and large gauze veil  once green but now faded to snuff colour  and ascended a dozen rungs of the ladder
at once she heard not ten yards off a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in agitating her
miss everdene let me assist you you should not attempt such a thing alone
troy was just opening the garden gate
bathsheba flung down the brush crook and empty hive pulled the skirt of her dress tightly round her ankles in a tremendous flurry and as well as she could slid down the ladder
by the time she reached the bottom troy was there also and he stooped to pick up the hive
how fortunate i am to have dropped in at this moment
exclaimed the sergeant
she found her voice in a minute
what
and will you shake them in for me
she asked in what for a defiant girl was a faltering way though for a timid girl it would have seemed a brave way enough
will i
said troy
why of course i will
how blooming you are today
troy flung down his cane and put his foot on the ladder to ascend
but you must have on the veil and gloves or you'll be stung fearfully
ah yes
i must put on the veil and gloves
will you kindly show me how to fix them properly
and you must have the broadbrimmed hat too for your cap has no brim to keep the veil off and they'd reach your face
the broadbrimmed hat too by all means
so a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be taken off  veil and all attached  and placed upon his head troy tossing his own into a gooseberry bush
then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round his collar and the gloves put on him
he looked such an extraordinary object in this guise that flurried as she was she could not avoid laughing outright
it was the removal of yet another stake from the palisade of cold manners which had kept him off bathsheba looked on from the ground whilst he was busy sweeping and shaking the bees from the tree holding up the hive with the other hand for them to fall into
she made use of an unobserved minute whilst his attention was absorbed in the operation to arrange her plumes a little
he came down holding the hive at arm's length behind which trailed a cloud of bees
upon my life
said troy through the veil holding up this hive makes one's arm ache worse than a week of swordexercise
when the manoeuvre was complete he approached her
would you be good enough to untie me and let me out
i am nearly stifled inside this silk cage
to hide her embarrassment during the unwonted process of untying the string about his neck she said   i have never seen that you spoke of
what
the swordexercise
ah
would you like to
said troy
bathsheba hesitated
she had heard wondrous reports from time to time by dwellers in weatherbury who had by chance sojourned awhile in casterbridge near the barracks of this strange and glorious perform ance tlie swordexercise
men and boys who had peeped through chinks or over walls into the barrack yard returned with accounts of its being the most flashing affair conceivable accoutrements and weapons glistening like starsheretherearoundyet all by rule and compass
so she said mildly what she felt strongly
yes i should like to see it very much
and so you shall you shall see me go through it
no
how
let me consider
not with a walkingstick  i don't care to see that
lt must be a real sword
yes i know and i have no sword here but i think i could get one by the evening
now will you do this
o no indeed
said bathsheba blushing
thank you very much but i couldn't on any account
surely you might
nobody would know
she shook her head but with a weakened negation
if i were to
she said i must bring liddy too
might i not
troy looked far away
i don't see why you want to bring her
he said coldly
an unconscious look of assent in bathsheba's eyes betrayed that something more than his coldness had made her also feel that liddy would be superfluous in the suggested scene
she had felt it even whilst making the proposal
well i won't bring liddy  and i'll come
but only for a very short time
she added a very short time
it will not take five minutes
said troy
chapter xxviii    the hollow amid the ferns   the hill opposite bathsheba's dwelling extended a mile off into an uncultivated tract of land dotted at this season with tall thickets of brake fern plump and diaphanous from recent rapid growth and radiant in hues of clear and untainted green
at eight o'clock this midsummer evening whilst the bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of the ferns with its long luxuriant rays a soft brushing by of garments might have been heard among them and bathsheba appeared in their midst their soft feathery arms caressing her up to her shoulders
she paused turned went back over the hill and halfway to her own door whence she cast a farewell glance upon the spot she had just left having resolved not to remain near the place after all
she saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the rise
it disappeared on the other side
she waited one minute  two minutes  thought of troy's disappointment at her nonfulfilment of a promised engagement till she again ran along the field clambered over the bank and followed the original direction
she was now literally trembling and panting at this her temerity in such an errant undertaking her breath came and went quickly and her eyes shone with an in frequent light
yet go she must
she reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns
troy stood in the bottom looking up towards her
i heard you rustling through the fern before i saw you
he said coming up and giving her his hand to help her down the slope
the pit was a saucershaped concave naturally formed with a top diameter of about thirty feet and shallow enough to allow the sunshine to reach their heads
standing in the centre the sky overhead was met by a circular horizon of fern  this grew nearly to the bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased
the middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled so yielding that the foot was halfburied within it
now
said troy producing the sword which as he raised it into the sunlight gleamed a sort of greeting like a living thing first we have four right and four left cuts four right and four left thrusts
infantry cuts and guards are more interesting than ours to my mind but they are not so swashing
they have seven cuts and three thrusts
so much as a preliminary
well next our cut one is as if you were sowing your corn  so
bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow upside down in the air and troy's arm was still again
cut two as if you were hedging  so
three as if you were reaping   so
four as if you were threshing  in that way
then the same on the left
the thrusts are these  one two three four right one two three four left
he repeated them
have 'em again
he said
one two     she hurriedly interrupted  i'd rather not though i don't mind your twos and fours but your ones and threes are terrible
very well
i'll let you off the ones and threes
next cuts points and guards altogether
troy duly exhibited them
then there's pursuing practice in this way
he gave the movements as before
there those are the stereotyped forms
the infantry have two most diabolical upward cuts which we are too humane to use
like this  three four
how murderous and bloodthirsty
they are rather deathy
now i'll be more inter esting and let you see some loose play  giving all the cuts and points infantry and cavalry quicker than lightning and as promiscuously  with just enough rule to regulate instinct and yet not to fetter it
you are my antagonist with this difference from real warfare that i shall miss you every time by one hair's breadth or perhaps two
mind you don't flinch whatever you do
i'll be sure not to
she said invincibly
he pointed to about a yard in front of him
bathsheba's adventurous spirit was beginning to find some grains of relish in these highly novel proceedings
she took up her position as directed facing troy
now just to learn whether you have pluck enough to let me do what i wish i'll give you a preliminary test
he flourished the sword by way of introduction number two and the next thing of which she was conscious was that the point and blade of the sword were darting with a gleam towards her left side just above her hip then of their reappearance on her right side emerging as it were from between her ribs having apparently passed through her body
the third item of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in troy's hand in the position technically called recover swords
all was as quick as electricity
oh
she cried out in affright pressing her hand to her side
have you run me through
 no you have not
whatever have you done
i have not touched you
said troy quietly
it was mere sleight of hand
the sword passed behind you
now you are not afraid are you
because if you are l can't perform
i give my word that l will not only not hurt you but not once touch you
i don't think i am afraid
you are quite sure you will not hurt me
quite sure
is the sword very sharp
o no  only stand as still as a statue
now
in an instant the atmosphere was transformed to bathsheba's eyes
beams of light caught from the low sun's rays above around in front of her wellnigh shut out earth and heaven  all emitted in the marvellous evolutions of troy's reflecting blade which seemed everywhere at once and yet nowherre specially
these circling gleams were accompanied by a keen rush that was almost a whistling  also springing from all sides of her at once
in short she was enclosed in a firmament of light and of sharp hisses resembling a skyfull of meteors close at hand
never since the broadsword became the national weapon had there been more dexterity shown in its management than by the hands of sergeant troy and never had he been in such splendid temper for the performance as now in the evening sunshine among the ferns with bathsheba
it may safely be asserted with respect to the closeness of his cuts that had it been possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a permanent substance wherever it flew past the space left untouched would have been almost a mould of bathsheba's figure
behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris she could see the hue of troy's sword arm spread in a scarlet haze over the space covered by its motions like a twanged harpstring and behind all troy himself mostly facing her sometimes to show the rear cuts half turned away his eye nevertheless always keenly measuring her breadth and outline and his lips tightly closed in sustained effort
next his movements lapsed slower and she could see them individually
the hissing of the sword had ceased and he stopped entirely
that outer loose lock of hair wants tidying he said before she had moved or spoken
wait i'll do it for you
an arc of silver shone on her right side the sword had descended
the lock droped to the ground
bravely borne
said troy
you didn't flinch a shade's thickness
wonderful in a woman
it was because i didn't expect it
o you have spoilt my hair
only once more
no  no
i am afraid of you  indeed i am
she cried
i won't touch you at all  not even your hair
i am only going to kill that caterpillar settling on you
now still
it appeared that a caterpillar had come from the fern and chosen the front of her bodice as his resting place
she saw the point glisten towards her bosom and seemingly enter it
bathsheba closed her eyes in the full persuasion that she was killed at last
how ever feeling just as usual she opened them again
there it is look
said the sargeant holding his sword before her eyes
the caterpillar was spitted upon its point
why it is magic
said bathsheba amazed
o no  dexterity
i merely gave point to your bosom where the caterpillar was and instead of running you through checked the extension a thousandth of an inch short of your surface
but how could you chop off a curl of my hair with a sword that has no edge
no edge
this sword will shave like a razor
look here
he touched the palm of his hand with the blade and then lifting it showed her a thin shaving of scarf skin dangling therefrom
but you said before beginning that it was blunt and couldn't cut me
that was to get you to stand still and so make sure of your safety
the risk of injuring you through your moving was too great not to force me to tell you a fib to escape it
she shuddered
i have been within an inch of my life and didn't know it
more precisely speaking you have been within half an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninetyfive tinies
cruel cruel 'tis of you
you have been perfectly safe nevertheless
my sword never errs
and troy returned the weapon to the scabbard
bathsheba overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel ings resulting from the scene abstractedly sat down on a tuft of heather
i must leave you now
said troy softly
and i'll venture to take and keep this in remembrance of you
she saw him stoop to the grass pick up the winding lock which he had severed from her manifold tresses twist it round his fingers unfasten a button in the breast of his coat and carefully put it inside
she felt power less to withstand or deny him
he was altogether too much for her and bathsheba seemed as one who facing a reviving wind finds it blow so strongly that it stops the breath
he drew near and said i must be leaving you
he drew nearer still
a minute later and she saw his scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket almost in a flash like a brand swiftly waved
that minute's interval had brought the blood beating into her face set her stinging as if aflame to the very hollows of her feet and enlarged emotion to a compass which quite swamped thought
it had brought upon her a stroke resulting as did that of moses in horeh in a liquid stream  here a stream of tears
she felt like one who has sinned a great sin
the circumstance had been the gentle dip of troy's mouth downwards upon her own
he had kissed her
chapter xxix    particulars of a twilight walk   we now see the element of folly distinctly mingling with the many varying particulars which made up the character of bathsheba everdene
it was almost foreign to her intrinsic nature
introduced as lymph on the dart of eros it eventually permeated and coloured her whole constitution
bathsheba though she had too much understanding to be entirely governed by her womanliness had too much womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage
perhaps in no minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more than in the strange power she possesses of believing cajoleries that she knows to be false  except indeed in that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she knows to be true
bathsheba loved troy in the way that only selfreliant women love when they abandon their selfreliance
when a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any strength to throw away
one source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion
she has never had practice in making the best of such a condition
weakness is doubly weak by being new
bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter
though in one sense a woman of the world it was after all that world of daylight coteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and winds the busy hum where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on the other side of your partywall where your neigh bour is everybody in the tything and where calculation formulated selfindulgence of bad nothing at all
had her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded and by herself they never were they would only have amounted to such a matter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion 
her love was entire as a child's and though warm as summer it was fresh as spring
her culpability lay in her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into consciences
she could show others the steep and thorny way but 'reck'd not her own rede and troy's deformities lay deep down from a woman's vision whilst his embellishments were upon the very surface thus contrasting with homely oak whose defects were patent to the blindest and whose vertues were as metals in a mine
the difference between love and respect was mark edly shown in her conduct
bathsheba had spoken of her interest in boldwood with the greatest freedom to liddy but she had only communed with her own heart concerning troy
all this infatuation gabriel saw and was troubled thereby from the time of his daily journey afield to the time of his return and on to the small hours of many a night
that he was not beloved had hitherto been his great that bathsheba was getting into the toils was now a sorrow greater than the first and one which nearly obscured it
it was a result which paralleled the oftquoted observation of hippocrates concerning physical pains
that is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the fear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his or her errors
oak determined to speak to his mistress
he would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair treatment of farmer boldwood now absent from home
an opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour ing cornfields
it was dusk when oak who had not been far afield that day took the same path and met her returning quite pensively as he thought
the wheat was now tall and the path was narrow thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side
two persons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop and oak stood aside to let her pass
oh is it gabriel
she said
you are taking a walk too
goodnight
i thought i would come to meet you as it is rather late said oak turning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat quickly by him
thank you indeed but i am not very fearful
o no but there are bad characters about
i never meet them
now oak with marvellous ingenuity had been going to introduce the gallant sergeant through the channel of bad characters
but all at once the scheme broke down it suddenly occurring to him that this was rather a clumsy way and too barefaced to begin with
he tried another preamble
and as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from home too  i mean farmer boldwood   why thinks i i'll go
he said
ah yes
she walked on without turning her head and for many steps nothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle of her dress against the heavy cornears
then she resumed rather tartly  i don't quite understand what you meant by saying that mr boldwood would naturally come to meet me
i meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take place between you and him miss
for give my speaking plainly
they say what is not true
she returned quickly
no marriage is likely to take place between us
gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion for the moment had come
well miss everdene
he said putting aside what people say i never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting of you
bathsheba would probably have terminated the con versation there and then by flatly forbidding the subject had not her conscious weakness of position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better it
since this subject has been mentioned
she said very emphatically i am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very common and very provoking
i didn't definitely promise mr boldwood anything
i have never cared for him
i respect him and he has urged me to marry him
but i have given him no distinct answer
as soon as he returns i shall do so and the answer will be that i cannot think of marrying him
people are full of mistakes seemingly
they are
the other day they said you were trifling with him and you almost proved that you were not lately they have said that you be not and you straightway begin to show     that i am i suppose you mean
well i hope they speak the truth
they do but wrongly applied
i don't trifle with him but then i have nothing to do with him
oak was unfortunately led on to speak of boldwood's rival in a wrong tone to her after all
i wish you had never met that young sergeant troy miss
he sighed
bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic
why
she asked
he is not good enough for 'ee
did any one tell you to speak to me like this
nobody at all
then it appears to me that sergeant troy does not concern us here
she said intractably
yet i must say that sergeant troy is an educated man and quite worthy of any woman
he is well born
his being higher in learning and birth than the ruck o' soldiers is anything but a proof of his worth
it show's his course to be down'ard
i cannot see what this has to do with our conversa tion
mr
troy's course is not by any means downward and his superiority is a proof of his worth
i believe him to have no conscience at all
and i cannot help begging you miss to have nothing to do with him
listen to me this once  only this once
i don't say he's such a bad man as i have fancied  i pray to god he is not
but since we don't exactly know what he is why not behave as if he might be bad simply for your own safety
don't trust him mistress i ask you not to trust him so
why pray
i like soldiers but this one i do not like
he said sturdily
his cleverness in his calling may have tempted him astray and what is mirth to the neighbours is ruin to the woman
when he tries to talk to 'ee again why not turn away with a short good day and when you see him coming one way turn the other
when he says anything laughable fail to see the point and don't smile and speak of him before those who will report your talk as that fantastical man
or  that sergeant what'shisname
that man of a family that has come to the dogs
don't be unmannerly towards en but harmlessuncivil and so get rid of the man
no christmas robin detained by a windowpane ever pulsed as did bathsheba now
i say  i say again  that it doesn't become you to talk about him
why he should be mentioned passes me quite 
she exclaimed desperately
i know this thththat he is a thoroughly conscientious man  blunt sometimes even to rudeness  but always speaking his mind about you plain to your face
oh
he is as good as anybody in this parish
he is very particular too about going to church  yes he is
i am afraid nobody saw him there
i never did certainly
the reason of that is
she said eagerly  that he goes in privately by the old tower door just when the service commences and sits at the back of the gallery
he told me so
this supreme instance of troy's goodness fell upon gabriel ears like the thirteenth stroke of crazy clock
it was not only received with utter incredulity as re garded itself but threw a doubt on all the assurances that had preceded it
oak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him
he brimmed with deep feeling as he replied in a steady voice the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpable ness of his great effort to keep it so   you know mistress that i love you and shall love you always
i only mention this to bring to your mind that at any rate i would wish to do you no harm beyond that i put it aside
i have lost in the race for money and good things and i am not such a fool as to pretend to 'ee now i am poor and you have got alto gether above me
but bathsheba dear mistress this i beg you to consider  that both to keep yourself well honoured among the workfolk and in common generosity to an honourable man who loves you as well as i you particulars of a twilight walk should be more discreet in your bearing towards this soldier
don't don't don't
she exclaimed in a choking voice
are ye not more to me than my own affairs and even life
he went on
come listen to me
i am six years older than you and mr boldwood is ten years older than i and consider  i do beg of 'ee to consider before it is too late  how safe you would be in his hands
oak's allusion to his own love for her lessened to some extent her anger at his interference but she could not really forgive him for letting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good any more than for his slighting treatment of troy
i wish you to go elsewhere
she commanded a paleness of face invisible to the eye being suggested by the trembling words
do not remain on this farm any longer
i don't want you  i beg you to go
that's nonsense
said oak calmly
this is the second time you have pretended to dismiss me and what's the use o' it
pretended
you shall go sir  your lecturing i will not hear
i am mistress here
go indeed  what folly will you say next
treating me like dick tom and harry when you know that a short time ago my position was as good as yours
upon my life bathsheba it is too barefaced
you know too that i can't go without putting things in such a strait as you wouldn't get out of i can't tell when
unless indeed you'll promise to have an understanding man as bailiff or manager or something
i'll go at once if you'll promise that
i shall have no bailiff i shall continue to be my own manager
she said decisively
very well then you should be thankful to me for biding
how would the farm go on with nobody to mind it but a woman
but mind this i don't wish ee to feel you owe me anything
not i
what i do i do
sometimes i say i should be as glad as a bird to leave the place  for don't suppose i'm content to be a nobody
i was made for better things
however i don't like to see your concerns going to ruin as they must if you keep in this mind
i hate taking my own measure so plain but upon my life your provok ing ways make a man say what he wouldn't dream of at other times
i own to being rather interfering
but you know well enough how it is and who she is that i like too well and feel too much like a fool about to be civil to her
it is more than probable that she privately and un consciously respected him a little for this grim fidelity which had been shown in his tone even more than in his words
at any rate she murmured something to the effect that he might stay if he wished
she said more distinctly  will you leave me alone now
i don't order it as a mistress  i ask it as a woman and i expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse
certainly i will miss everdene
said gabriel gently
he wondered that the request should have come at this moment for the strife was over and they were on a most desolate hill far from every human habitation and the hour was getting late
he stood still and allowed her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form upon the sky
a distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that point now ensued
a figure apparently rose from the earth beside her
the shape beyond all doubt was troy's
oak would not be even a possible listener and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards were between the lovers and himself
gabriel went home by way of the churchyard
in passing the tower he thought of what she had said about the sergeant's virtuous habit of entering the church un particulars of a twilight walk perceived at the beginning of service
believing that the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused he ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which it stood and examined it
the pale lustre yet hanging in the northwestern heaven was sufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door to a length of more than a foot delicately tying the panel to the stone jamb
it was a decisive proof that the door had not been opened at least since troy came back to weatherbury
chapter xxx    hot cheeks and tearful eyes   half an hour later bathsheba entered her own house
there burnt upon her face when she met the light of the candles the flush and excitement which were little less than chronic with her now
the farewell words of troy who had accompanied her to the very door still lingered in her ears
he had bidden her adieu for two days which were so he stated to be spent at bath in visiting some friends
he had also kissed her a second time
it is only fair to bathsheba to explain here a little fact which did not come to light till a long time after wards  that troy's presentation of himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre concerted arrangement
he had hinted  she had forbidden and it was only on the chance of his still coming that she had dismissed oak fearing a meeting between them just then
she now sank down into a chair wild and perturbed by all these new and fevering sequences
then she jumped up with a manner of decision and fetched her desk from a side table
in three minutes without pause or modification she had written a letter to boldwood at his address beyond casterbridge saying mildly but firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had brought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon that her final decision was that she could not marry him
she had expressed to oak an intention to wait till boldwood came home before communicating to him her conclusive reply
but bathsheba found that she could not wait
it was impossible to send this letter till the next day yet to quell her uneasiness by getting it out of her hands and so as it were setting the act in motion at once she arose to take it to any one of the women who might be in the kitchen
she paused in the passage
a dialogue was going on in the kitchen and bathsheba and troy were the subject of it
if he marry her she'll gie up farming
twill be a gallant life but may bring some trouble between the mirth  so say i
well i wish i had half such a husband
bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously what her servitors said about her but too much womanly redundance of speech to leave alone what was said till it died the natural death of unminded things
she burst in upon them
who are you speaking of
she asked
there was a pause before anybody replied
at last liddy said frankly what was passing was a bit of a word about yourself miss
i thought so
maryann and liddy and temper ance  now i forbid you to suppose such things
you know i don't care the least for mr
troy  not i every body knows how much i hate him
 yes
repeated the froward young person hate him
we know you do miss
said liddy and so do we all
i hate him too
said maryann
maryann  o you perjured woman
how can you speak that wicked story
said bathsheba excitedly
you admired him from your heart only this morning in the very world you did
yes maryann you know it
yes miss but so did you
he is a wild scamp now and you are right to hate him
he's not a wild scamp
how dare you to my face
i have no right to hate him nor you nor anybody
but i am a silly woman
what is it to me what he is
you know it is nothing
i don't care for him i dont mean to defend his good name not i
mind this if any of you say a word against him you'll be dismissed instantly
she flung down the letter and surged back into the parlour with a big heart and tearful eyes liddy following her
o miss
said mild liddy looking pitifully into bathsheba's face
i am sorry we mistook you so
did think you cared for him but i see you don't now
shut the door liddy
liddy closed the door and went on  people always say such foolery miss
i'll make answer hencefor'ard of course a lady like miss everdene can't love him i'll say it out in plain black and white
bathsheba burst out  o liddy are you such a simpleton
can't you read riddles
can't you see
are you a woman yourself
liddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment
yes you must be a blind thing liddy
she said in reckless abandonment and grief
o i love him to very distraction and misery and agony
don't be frightened at me though perhaps i am enough to frighten any innocent woman
come closer  closer
she put her arms round liddy's neck
i must let it out to somebody it is wearing me away
don't you yet know enough of me to see through that miserable denial of mine
o god what a lie it was
heaven and my love forgive me
and don't you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love
there go out of the room i want to be quite alone
liddy went towards the door
liddy come here
solemnly swear to me that he's not a fast man that it is all lies they say about him
put miss how can i say he is not if     you graceless girl
how can you have the cruel heart to repeat what they say
unfeeling thing that you are
but i'll see if you or anybody else in the village or town either dare do such a thing
she started off pacing from fireplace to door and back again
no miss
i don't  i know it is not true
said liddy frightened at bathsheba's unwonted vehemence
i suppose you only agree with me like that to please me
but liddy he cannot be had as is said
do you hear 
yes miss yes
and you don't believe he is
i don't know what to say miss
said liddy be ginning to cry
if i say no you dont believe me and if i say yes you rage at me
say you don't believe it  say you don't
i don't believe him to be so had as they make out
he is not had at all my poor life and heart how weak i am
she moaned in a relaxed desultory way heedless of liddy's presence
o how i wish i had never seen him
loving is misery for women always
i shall never forgive god for making me a woman and dearly am i beginning to pay for the honour of owning a pretty face
she freshened and turned to liddy suddenly
mind this lydia smallbury if you repeat anywhere a single word of what l have said to you inside this closed door i'll never trust you or love you or have you with me a moment longer  not a moment
i don't want to repeat anything
said liddy with womanly dignity of a diminutive order but i don't wish to stay with you
and if you please i'll go at the end of the harvest or this week or today
i don't see that i deserve to be put upon and stormed at for nothing
concluded the small woman bigly
no no liddy you must stay
said bathsheba dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence
you must not notice my being in a taking just now
you are not as a servant  you are a companion to me
dear dear  i don't know what i am doing since this miserable ache o'
my heart has weighted and worn upon me so
what shall i come to
i suppose i shall get further and further into troubles
i wonder sometimes if i am doomed to die in the union
i am friendless enough god knows
i won't notice anything nor will i leave you
sobbed liddy impulsively putting up her lips to bathsheba's and kissing her
then bathsheba kissed liddy and all was smooth again
i don't often cry do i lidd
but you have made tears come into my eyes
she said a smile shining through the moisture
try to think him a good man won't you dear liddy
i will miss indeed
he is a sort of steady man in a wild way you know
way
i am afraid that's how i am
and promise me to keep my secret  do liddy
and do not let them know that i have been crying about him because it will be dreadful for me and no good to him poor thing
death's head himself shan't wring it from me mistress if i've a mind to keep anything and i'll always be your friend
replied liddy emphatically at the same time bringing a few more tears into her own eyes not from any particular necessity but from an artistic sense of making herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture which seems to influence women at such times
i think god likes us to be good friends don't you
indeed i do
and dear miss you wont harry me and storm at me will you
because you seem to swell so tall as a lion then and it frightens me
do you know i fancy you would be a match for any man when you are in one o' your takings
never
do you
said bathsheba slightly laughing though somewhat seriously alarmed by this amazonian picture of herself
i hope i am not a bold sort of maid  mannish
she continued with some anxiety
o no not mannish but so almighty womanish that 'tis getting on that way sometimes
ah
miss
she said after having drawn her breath very sadly in and sent it very sadly out i wish i had half your failing that way
'tis a great protection to a poor maid in these illegit'mate days
chapter xxxi    blame  fury   the next evening bathsheba with the idea of getting out of the way of mr boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note in person proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with liddy some few hours earlier
bathsheba's companion as a gage of their reconciliation had been granted a week's holiday to visit her sister who was married to a thriving hurdler and cattlecribmaker living in a delightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond yalbury
the arrangement was that miss everdene should honour them by coming there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con trivances which this man of the woods had introduced into his wares
leaving her instructions with gabriel and maryann that they were to see everything carefully locked up for the night she went out of the house just at the close of a timely thundershower which had refined the air and daintily bathed the coat of the land though all beneath was dry as ever
freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied contours of bank and hollow as if the earth breathed maiden breath and the pleased birds were hymning to the scene
before her among the clouds there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour hood of a hidden sun lingering on to the farthest north west corner of the heavens that this midsummer season allowed
she had walked nearly two miles of her journey watching how the day was retreating and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of thought to give place in its turn to the time of prayer and sleep when she beheld advancing over yalbury hill the very man she sought so anxiously to elude
boldwood was stepping on not with that quiet tread of reserved strength which was his customary gait in which he always seemed to be balancing two thoughts
his manner was stunned and sluggish now
boldwood had for the first time been awakened to woman's privileges in tergiversation even when it involves another person's possible blight
that bathsheba was a firm and positive girl far less inconsequent than her fellows had been the very lung of his hope for he had held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a straight course for consistency's sake and accept him though her fancy might not flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical love
but the argument now came back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror
the dis covery was no less a scourge than a surprise
he came on looking upon the ground and did not see bathsheba till they were less than a stone's throw apart
he looked up at the sound of her pitpat and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter
oh is it you mr
boldwood
she faltered a guilty warmth pulsing in her face
those who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a means more effective than words
there are accents in the eye which are not on the tongue and more tales come from pale lips than can enter an ear
it is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter moods that they avoid the pathway of sound
bold wood's look was unanswerable
seeing she turned a little aside he said what are you afraid of me
why should you say that
said bathsheba
i fancied you looked so
said he
and it is most strange because of its contrast with my feeling for you
she regained selfpossession fixed her eyes calmly and waited
you know what that feeling is
continued boldwood deliberately
a thing strong as death
no dismissal by a hasty letter affects that
i wish you did not feel so strongly about me
she murmured
it is generous of you and more than i deserve but i must not hear it now
hear it
what do you think i have to say then
i am not to marry you and that's enough
your letter was excellently plain
i want you to hear nothing  not i
bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for freeing herself from this fearfully and was moving on
boldwood walked up to her heavily and dully
bathsheba  darling  is it final indeed
indeed it is
o bathsheba  have pity upon me
boldwood burst out
god's sake yes  i am come to that low lowest stage  to ask a woman for pity
still she is you  she is you
bathsheba commanded herself well
but she could hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to her lips there is little honour to the woman in that speech
it was only whispered for something unutter ably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a passion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios
i am beyond myself about this and am mad
he said
i am no stoic at all to he supplicating here but i do supplicate to you
i wish you knew what is in me of devotion to you but it is impossible that
in bare human mercy to a lonely man don't throw me off now
i don't throw you off  indeed how can i
i never had you
in her noonclear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment her thoughtless angle on that day in february
but there was a time when you turned to me before i thought of you
i don't reproach you for even now i feel that the ignorant and cold darkness that i should have lived in if you had not attracted me by that letter  valentine you call it  would have been worse than my knowledge of you though it has brought this misery
but i say there was a time when i knew nothing of you and cared nothing for you and yet you drew me on
and if you say you gave me no en couragement i cannot but contradict you
what you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute
i have bitterly repented of it   ay bitterly and in tears
can you still go on re minding me
i don't accuse you of it  i deplore it
i took for earnest what you insist was jest and now this that i pray to be jest you say is awful wretched earnest
our moods meet at wrong places
i wish your feeling was more like mine or my feeling more like yours
o could i but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into how i should have cursed you but only having been able to see it since i cannot do that for i love you too well
but it is weak idle drivelling to go on like this bathsheba you are the first woman of any shade or nature that i have ever looked at to love and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard to bear
how nearly you promised me
but i don't speak now to move your heart and make you grieve because of my pain it is no use that
i must bear it my pain would get no less by paining you
but i do pity you  deeply  o so deeply
she earnestly said
do no such thing  do no such thing
your dear love bathsheba is such a vast thing beside your pity that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow nor does the gain of your pity make it sensibly less
o sweet  how dearly you spoke to me behind the spearbed at the washingpool and in the barn at the shearing and that dearest last time in the evening at your home
where are your pleasant words all gone  your earnest hope to be able to love me
where is your firm conviction that you would get to care for me very much
really forgotten
 really
she checked emotion looked him quietly and clearly in the face and said in her low firm voice  mr bold wood i promised you nothing
would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest highest compliment a man can pay a woman  telling her he loves her
i was bound to show some feeling if l would not be a graceless shrew
yet each of those pleasures was just for the day  the day just for the pleasure
how was i to know that what is a pastime to all other men was death to you
have reason do and think more kindly of me
well never mind arguing  never mind
one thing is sure you were all but mine and now you are not nearly mine
everything is changed and that by you alone remember
you were nothing to me once and i was contented you are now nothing to me again and how different the second nothing is from the first
would to god you had never taken me up since it was only to throw me down
bathsheba in spite of her mettle began to feel un mistakable signs that she was inherently the weaker vessel
she strove miserably against this feminity which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions in stronger and stronger current
she had tried to elude agitation by fixing her mind on the trees sky any trivial object before her eyes whilst his reproaches fell but ingenuity could not save her now
i did not take you up  surely i did not
she answered as heroically as she could
but don't be in this mood with me
i can endure being told i am in the wrong if you will only tell it me gently
o sir will you not kindly forgive me and look at it cheerfully
cheerfully
can a man fooled to utter heart burning find a reason for being merry if i have lost how can i be as if i had won
heavens you must be heartless quite
had i known what a fearfully bitter sweet this was to be how would i have avoided you and never seen you and been deaf of you
i tell you all this but what do you care
you don't care
she returned silent and weak denials to his charges and swayed her head desperately as if to thrust away the words as they came showering about her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life with his bronzed roman face and fine frame
dearest dearest i am wavering even now between the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you and labouring humbly for you again
forget that you have said no and let it be as it was
say bathsheba that you only wrote that refusal to me in fun  come say it to me
it would be untrue and painful to both of us
you overrate my capacity for love
i don't possess half the warmth of nature you believe me to have
an un protected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentle ness out of me
he immediately said with more resentment that may be true somewhat but ah miss everdene it won't do as a reason
you are not the cold woman you would have me believe
no no
it isn't because you have no feeling in you that you don't love me
you naturally would have me think so  you would hide from that you have a burning heart like mine
you have love enough but it is turned into a new channel
i know where
the swift music of her heart became hubbub now and she throbbed to extremity
he was coming to troy
he did then know what had occurred
and the name fell from his lips the next moment
why did troy not leave my treasure alone
he asked fiercely
when i had no thought of injuring him why did he force himself upon your notice
before he worried you your inclination was to have me when next i should have come to you your answer would have been yes
can you deny it  i ask can you deny it
she delayed the reply but was to honest to with hold it
i cannot
she whispered
i know you cannot
but he stole in in my absence and robbed me
why did't he win you away before when nobody would have been grieved
 when nobody would have been set talebearing
now the people sneer at me  the very hills and sky seem to laugh at me till i blush shamefuly for my folly
i have lost my respect my good name my standing  lost it never to get it again
go and marry your man  go on
o sir  mr
boldwood
you may as well
i have no further claim upon you
as for me i had better go somewhere alone and hide  and pray
i loved a woman once
i am now ashamed
when i am dead they'll say miserable lovesick man that he was
heaven  heaven  if i had got jilted secretly and the dishonour not known and my position kept
but no matter it is gone and the woman not gained
shame upon him  shame
his unreasonable anger terrified her and she glided from him without obviously moving as she said i am only a girl  do not speak to me so
all the time you knew  how very well you knew  that your new freak was my misery
dazzled by brass and scarlet  o bathsheba  this is woman's folly indeed
she fired up at once
you are taking too much upon yourself
she said vehemently
everybody is upon me   everybody
it is unmanly to attack a woman so
i have nobody in the world to fight my battles for me but no mercy is shown
yet if a thousand of you sneer and say things against me i will not be put down
you'll chatter with him doubtless about me
say to him boldwood would have died for me
yes and you have given way to him knowing him to be not the man for you
he has kissed you  claimed you as his
do you hear  he has kissed you
deny it
the most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man and although boldwood was in vehemence and glow nearly her own self rendered into another sex bathsheba's cheek quivered
she gasped leave me sir  leave me
i am nothing to you
let me go on
deny that he has kissed you
i shall not
ha  then he has
came hoarsely from the farmer
he has she said slowly and in spite of her fear defiantly
i am not ashamed to speak the truth
then curse him and curse him
said boldwood breaking into a whispered fury
whilst i would have given worlds to touch your hand you have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and  kiss you
heaven's mercy  kiss you
 ah a time of his life shall come when he will have to repent and think wretchedly of the pain he has caused another man and then may he ache and wish and curse and yearn  as i do now
don't don't o don't pray down evil upon him
she implored in a miserable cry
anything but that  anything
o be kind to him sir for i love him true 
boldwood's ideas had reached that point of fusion at which outline and consistency entirely disappear
the impending night appeared to concentrate in his eye
he did not hear her at all now
i'll punish him  by my soul that will i
i'll meet him soldier or no and i'll horsewhip the untimely stripling for this reckless theft of my one delight
if he were a hundred men i'd horsewhip him    he dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally
bath sheba sweet lost coquette pardon me
i've been blaming you threatening you behaving like a churl to you when he's the greatest sinner
he stole your dear heart away with his unfathomable lies
 lt is a fortunate thing for him that he's gone back to his regiment  that he's away up the country and not here
i hope he may not return here just yet
i pray god he may not come into my sight for i may be tempted beyond myself
o bathsheba keep him away  yes keep him away from me
for a moment boldwood stood so inertly after this that his soul seemed to have been entirely exhaled with the breath of his passionate words
he turned his face away and withdrew and his form was soon covered over by the twilight as his footsteps mixed in with the low hiss of the leafy trees
bathsheba who had been standing motionless as a model all this latter time flung her hands to her face and wildly attempted to ponder on the exhibition which had just passed away
such astounding wells of fevered feeling in a still man like mr boldwood were incompre hensible dreadful
instead of being a man trained to repression he was  what she had seen him
the force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a circumstance known at present only to herself her lover was coming back to weatherby in the course of the very next day or two
troy had not returned to his distant barracks as boldwood and others supposed but had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in bath and had yet a week or more remaining to his furlough
she felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this nick of time and came into contact with boldwooda fierce quarrel would be the consequence
she panted with solicitude when she thought of possible injury to troy
the least spark would kindle the farmer's swift feelings of rage and jealousy he would lose his selfmastery as he had this evening troy's blitheness might become aggressive it might take the direction of derision and boldwood's anger might then take the direction of revenge
with almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing girl this guileless woman too well concealed from the world under a manner of carelessness the warm depths of her strong emotions
but now there was no reserve
in fer her distraction instead of advancing further she walked up and down beating the air with her fingers pressing on her brow and sobbing brokenly to herself
then she sat down on a heap of stones by the wayside to think
there she remained long
above the dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontor ies of coppery cloudbounding a green and pellucid expanse in the western sky
amaranthine glosses came over them then and the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting prospect eastward in the shape of indecisive and palpitating stars
she gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of space but realised none at all
her troubled spirit was far away with troy
chapter xxxii    night  horses tramping   the village of weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard in its midst and the living were lying well nigh as still as the dead
the church clock struck eleven
the air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the clockwork immediately before the strokes was distinct and so was also the click of the same at their close
the notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things  flapping and rebounding among walls undulating against the scattered clouds spreading through their interstices into unexplored miles of space
bathsheba's crannied and mouldy halls were tonight occupied only by maryann liddy being as was stated with her sister whom bathsheba had set out to visit
a few minutes after eleven had struck maryann turned in her bed with a sense of being disturbed
she was totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to her sleep
it led to a dream and the dream to an awakening with an uneasy sensation that something had happened
she left her bed and looked out of the window
the paddock abutted on this end of the building and in the paddock she could just discern by the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the horse that was feeding there
the figure seized the horse by the forelock and led it to the corner of the field
here she could see some object which circum stances proved to be a vehicle for after a few minutes the horse down the road mingled with the sound of light wheels
two varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with the ghostlike glide of that mysterious figure
they were a woman and a gipsy man
a woman was out of the question in such an occupation at this hour and the comer could be no less than a thief who might probably have known the weakness of the house hold on this particular night and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt
moreover to raise suspicion to conviction itself there were gipsies in
weatherbury bottom
maryann who had been afraid to shout in the robber's presence having seen him depart had no fear
she hastily slipped on her clothes stumped down the dis jointed staircase with its hundred creaks ran to coggan's the nearest house and raised an alarm
coggan called gabriel who now again lodged in his house as at first and together they went to the paddock
beyond all doubt the horse was gone
hark
said gabriel
they listened
distinct upon the stagnant air came the sounds of a trotting horse passing up longpuddle lane  just beyond the gipsies' encampment in weather bury bottom
that's our daintyi'll swear to her step
said jan mighty me
won't mis'ess storm and call us stupids wen she comes back
moaned maryann
how i wish it had happened when she was at home and none of us had been answerable
we must ride after
said gabriel decisively
be responsible to miss everdene for what we do
yes we'll follow 
faith i don't see how
said coggan
all our horses are too heavy for that trick except little poppet and what's she between two of usif we only had that pair over the hedge we might do something
which pair
mr boldwood's tidy and moll
then wait here till i come hither again
said gabriel
he ran down the hill towards farmer boldwood's
farmer boldwood is not at home
said maryann
all the better
said coggan
i know what he's gone for
less than five minutes brought up oak again running at the same pace with two halters dangling from his hand
where did you find 'em
said coggan turning round and leaping upon the hedge without waiting for an answer
under the eaves
i knew where they were kept said gabriel following him
coggan you can ride barebacked
there's no time to look for saddles
like a hero
said jan maryann you go to hed
gabriel shouted to her from the top of the hedge
springing down into boldwood's pastures each pocketed his halter to hide it from the horses who seeing the men emptyhanded docilely allowed them selves to he seized by the mane when the halters were dexterously slipped on
having neither bit nor bridle oak and coggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case through the animal's mouth and looping it on the other side
oak vaulted astride and coggan clambered up by aid of the hank when they ascended to the gate and galloped off in the direction taken by bathsheha's horse and the robber
whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to was a matter of some uncertainty
weatherbury bottom was reached in three or four minutes
they scanned the shady green patch by the roadside
the gipsies were gone
the villains
said gabriel
which way have they gone i wonder
straight on as sure as god made little apples said jan very well we are better mounted and must over discovered
the roadmetal grew softer and more rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic but not muddy state
they came to crossroads
coggan suddenly pulled up moll and slipped off
what's the matter
said gabriel
we must try to track 'em since we can't hear 'em said jan fumbling in his pockets
he struck a light and held the match to the ground
the rain had been heavier here and all foot and horse tracks made previous to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops and they were now so many little scoops of water which reflected the flame of the match like eyes
one set of tracks was fresh and had no water in them one pair of ruts was also empty and not small canals like the others
the footprints forming this recent impression were full of information as to pace they were in equidistant pairs three or four feet apart the right and left foot of each pair being exactly opposite one another
straight on
jan exclaimed
tracks like that mean a stiff gallop
no wonder we don't hear him
and the horse is harnessed  look at the ruts
ay how do you know
old jimmy harris only shoed her last week and i'd swear to his make among ten thousand
the rest of the gipsies must ha gone on earlier or some other way
said oak
you saw there were no other tracks
true
they rode along silently for a long weary time
coggan carried an old pinchbeck repeater which he had inherited from some genius in his family and it now struck one
he lighted another match and ex amined the ground again
'tis a canter now
he said throwing away the light
a twisty rickety pace for a gig
the fact is they over drove her at starting we shall catch 'em yet
again they hastened on and entered blackmore vale
coggan's watch struck one
when they looked again the hoofmarks were so spaced as to form a sort of zigzag if united like the lamps along a street
that's a trot i know
said gabriel
only a trot now
said coggan cheerfully
we shall overtake him in time
they pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles
ah
a moment
said jan let's see how she was driven up this hill
twill help us
a light was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before and the ex amination made hurrah
said coggan
she walked up here  and well she might
we shall get them in two miles for a crown
they rode three and listened
no sound was to be heard save a millpond trickling hoarsely through a hatch and suggesting gloomy possibilities of drowning by jumping in
gabriel dismounted when they came to a turning
the tracks were absolutely the only guide as to the direction that they now had and great caution was necessary to avoid confusing them with some others which had made their appearance lately
what does this mean
 though i guess
said gabriel looking up at coggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning
coggan who no less than the panting horses had latterly shown signs of weariness again scrutinized the mystic characters
this time only three were of the regular horseshoe shape
every fourth was a dot
he screwed up his face and emitted a long whewww
lame
said oak
yes dainty is lamed the nearfootafore
said coggan slowly staring still at the footprints
we'll push on
said gabriel remounting his humid steed
although the road along its greater part had been as good as any turnpikeroad in the country it was nomin ally only a byway
the last turning had brought them into the high road leading to bath
coggan recollected himself
we shall have him now
he exclaimed
where
sherton turnpike
the keeper of that gate is the sleepiest man between here and london  dan randall
that's his name  knowed en for years when he was at casterbridge gate
between the lameness and the gate 'tis a done job
'twas said until against a shady background of foliage five white bars were visible crossing their route a little way ahead
hush  we are almost close
said gabriel
amble on upon the grass
said coggan
the white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in front of them
the silence of this lonely time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter
hoyahoy
gate
it appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not noticed for on their close approach the door of the turnpikehouse opened and the keeper came out halfdressed with a candle in his hand
the rays illumined the whole group
keep the gate close
shouted gabriel
he has stolen the horse
who
said the turnpikeman
gabriel looked at the driver of the gig and saw a woman  bathsheba his mistress
on hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light
coggan had however caught sight of her in the meanwhile
why 'tis mistressi'll take my oath
he said amazed
bathsheba it certainly was and she had by this time done the trick she could do so well in crises not of love namely mask a surprise by coolness of manner
well gabriel
she inquired quietly where are you going
we thought    began gabriel
bath
she said taking for her own use the assurance that gabriel lacked
an important matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to liddy and go off at once
what then were you following me
we thought the horse was stole
wellwhat a thing
how very foolish of you not to know that i had taken the trap and horse
i could neither wake maryann nor get into the house though i hammered for ten minutes against her windowsill
fortunately i could get the key of the coachhouse so i troubled no one further
didn't you think it might be me
why should we miss
perhaps not why those are never farmer bold wood's horses
goodness mercy
what have you been doing bringing trouble upon me in this way
what
mustn't a lady move an inch from her door without being dogged like a thief
but how was we to know if you left no account of your doings
expostulated coggan and ladies don't drive at these hours miss as a jineral rule of society
i did leave an account  and you would have seen it in the morning
i wrote in chalk on the coachhouse doors that i had come back for the horse and gig and driven off that i could arouse nobody and should return soon
but you'll consider ma'am that we couldn't see that till it got daylight
true
she said and though vexed at first she had too much sense to blame them long or seriously for a devotion to her that was as valuable as it was rare
she added with a very pretty grace well i really thank you heartily for taking all this trouble but i wish you had borrowed anybody's horses but mr
boldwood's
dainty is lame miss
said coggan
can ye go on
lt was only a stone in her shoe
i got down and pulled it out a hundred yards back
i can manage very well thank you
i shall be in bath by daylight
will you now return please
she turned her head  the gateman's candle shimmering upon her quick clear eyes as she did so  passed through the gate and was soon wrapped in the embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs
coggan and gabriel put about their horses and fanned by the velvety air of this july night retraced the road by which they had come
a strange vagary this of hers isn't it oak
said coggan curiously
yes
said gabriel shortly
she won't be in bath by no daylight
coggan suppose we keep this night's work as quiet as we can
i am of one and the same mind
very well
we shall be home by three o'clock or so and can creep into the parish like lambs
bathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside had ultimately evolved a conclusion that there were only two remedies for the present desperate state of affairs
the first was merely to keep troy away from weather bury till boldwood's indignation had cooled the second to listen to oak's entreaties and boldwood's denuncia tions and give up troy altogether
alas
could she give up this new love  induce him to renounce her by saying she did not like him  could no more speak to him and beg him for her good to end his furlough in bath and see her and weather bury no more
it was a picture full of misery but for a while she contemplated it firmly allowing herself nevertheless as girls will to dwell upon the happy life she would have enjoyed had troy been boldwood and the path of love the path of duty  inflicting upon herself gratuit ous tortures by imagining him the lover of another woman after forgetting her for she had penetrated troy's nature so far as to estimate his tendencies pretty accurately hut unfortunately loved him no less in thinking that he might soon cease to love her  indeed considerably more
she jumped to her feet
she would see him at once
yes she would implore him by word of mouth to assist her in this dilemma
a letter to keep him away could not reach him in time even if he should be disposed to listen to it
was bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support of a lover's arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him
or was she sophistically sensible with a thrill of pleasure that by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was ensuring a meeting with him at any rate once more
it was now dark and the hour must have been nearly ten
the only way to accomplish her purpose was to give up her idea of visiting liddy at yalbury return to weatherbury farm put the horse into the gig and drive at once to bath
the scheme seemed at first impossible the journey was a fearfully heavy one even for a strong horse at her own estimate and she much underrated the distance
it was most venturesome for a woman at night and alone
but could she go on to liddy's and leave things to take their course
no no anything but that
bath sheba was full of a stimulating turbulence beside which caution vainly prayed for a hearing
she turned back towards the village
her walk was slow for she wished not to enter weatherbury till the cottagers were in bed and par ticularly till boldwood was secure
her plan was now to drive to bath during the night see sergeant troy in the morning before he set out to come to her bid him farewell and dismiss him then to rest the horse thoroughly herself to weep the while she thought starting early the next morning on her return journey
by this arrangement she could trot dainty gently all the day reach liddy at yalbury in the evening and come home to weatherbury with her whenever they chose  so nobody would know she had been to bath at all
such was bathsheba's scheme
but in her topo graphical ignorance as a late comer to the place she misreckoned the distance of her journey as not much more than half what it really was
her idea however she proceeded to carry out with what initial success we have already seen
chapter xxxiii    in the sun  a harbinger   a week passed and there were no tidings of bath sheba nor was there any explanation of her gilpin's rig
then a note came for maryann stating that the business which had called her mistress to bath still detained her there but that she hoped to return in the course of another week
another week passed
the oatharvest began and all the men were afield under a monochromatic lammas sky amid the trembling air and short shadows of noon
indoors nothing was to be heard save the droning of bluebottle flies outofdoors the whetting of scythes and the hiss of tressy oatears rubbing together as their perpendicular stalks of amberyellow fell heavily to each swath
every drop of moisture not in the men's bottles and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira tion from their foreheads and cheeks
drought was everywhere else
they were about to withdraw for a while into the charitable shade of a tree in the fence when coggan saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running to them across the field
i wonder who that is
he said
i hope nothing is wrong about mistress
said maryann who with some other women was tying the bundles oats being always sheafed on this farm but an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning
l went to unlock the door and dropped the key and it fell upon the stone floor and broke into two pieces
breaking a key is a dreadful bodement
i wish mis'ess was home
'tis cain ball
said gabriel pausing from whetting his reaphook
oak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the cornfield but the harvest month is an anxious time for a farmer and the corn was bathsheba's so he lent a hand
he's dressed up in his best clothes
said matthew moon
he hev been away from home for a few days since he's had that felon upon his finger for 'a said since i can't work i'll have a hollerday
a good time for one  a excellent time
said joseph poorgrass straightening his back for he like some of the others had a way of resting a while from his labour on such hot days for reasons preternaturally small of which cain pall's advent on a weekday in his sunday clothes was one of the first magnitude
twas a bad leg allowed me to read the pilgrim's progress and mark clark learnt alifours in a whitlow
ay and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go courting
said jan coggan in an eclipsing tone wiping his face with his shirtsleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of his neck
by this time cainy was nearing the group of harvesters and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand from which he took mouthfuls as he ran the other being wrapped in a bandage
when he came close his mouth assumed the bell shape and he began to cough violently
now cainy
said gabriel sternly
how many more times must i tell you to keep from running so fast when you be eating
you'll choke yourself some day that's what you'll do cain ball
hokhokhok
replied cain
a crumb of my victuals went the wrong way  hokhok that's what 'tis mister oak
and i've been visiting to bath because i had a felon on my thumb yes and l've seen  ahokhok
directly cain mentioned bath they all threw down their hooks and forks and drew round him
un fortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his narrative powers and a supplementary hindrance was that of a sneeze jerking from his pocket his rather large watch which dangled in front of the young man pendulumwise
yes
he continued directing his thoughts to bath and letting his eyes follow l've seed the world at last   yes  and i've seed our mis'ess  ahokhokhok
bother the boy
said gabriel
something is always going the wrong way down your throat so that you can't tell what's necessary to be told
ahok
there
please mister oak a gnat have just fleed into my stomach and brought the cough on again
yes that's just it
your mouth is always open you young rascal
'tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat pore boy
said matthew moon
well at bath you saw    prompted gabriel
i saw our mistress
continued the junior shepherd and a sojer walking along
and bymeby they got closer and closer and then they went armincrook like courting complete  hokhok
like courting complete  hok
 courting complete     losing the thread of his narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of breath their informant looked up and down the field apparently for some clue to it
well i see our mis'ess and a soldier  ahaawk
damn the boy
said gabriel
'tis only my manner mister oak if ye'll excuse it said cain ball looking reproachfully at oak with eyes drenched in their own dew
here's some cider for him  that'll cure his throat said jan coggan lifting a flagon of cider pulling out the cork and applying the hole to cainy's mouth joseph poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think apprehensively of the serious consequences that would follow cainy ball's strangulation in his cough and the history of his bath adventures dying with him
for my poor self i always say please god afore i do anything
said joseph in an unboastful voice and so should you cain ball
'tis a great safeguard and might perhaps save you from being choked to death some day
mr coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liber ality at the suffering cain's circular mouth half of it running down the side of the flagon and half of what reached his mouth running down outside his throat and half of what ran in going the wrong way and being coughed and sneezed around the persons of the gathered reapers in the form of a cider fog which for a moment hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation
there's a great clumsy sneeze
why can't ye have better manners you young dog
said coggan with drawing the flagon
the cider went up my nose
cried cainy as soon as he could speak and now 'tis gone down my neck and into my poor dumb felon and over my shiny buttons and all my best cloze
the poor lad's cough is terrible unfortunate
said matthew moon
and a great history on hand too
bump his back shepherd
'tis my nater
mourned cain
mother says i always was so excitable when my feelings were worked up to a point
true true
said joseph poorgrass
the balls were always a very excitable family
i knowed the boy's grandfather  a truly nervous and modest man even to genteel refinery
'twas blush blush with him almost as much as 'tis with me  not but that 'tis a fault in me
not at all master poorgrass
said coggan
'tis a very noble quality in ye
hehheh
well i wish to noise nothing abroad  nothing at all
murmured poorgrass diffidently
but we be born to things  that's true
yet i would rather my trifle were hid though perhaps a high nater is a little high and at my birth all things were possible to my maker and he may have begrudged no gifts
but under your bushel joseph
under your bushel with ee
a strange desire neighbours this desire to hide and no praise due
yet there is a sermon on the mount with a calendar of the blessed at the head and certain meek men may be named therein
cainy's grandfather was a very clever man
said matthew moon
invented a' appletree out of his own head which is called by his name to this day  the early ball
you know 'em jan
a quarrenden grafted on a tom putt and a ratheripe upon top o' that again
'tis trew 'a used to bide about in a publichouse wi' a woman in a way he had no business to by rights but there  'a were a clever man in the sense of the term
now then
said gabriel impatiently  what did you see cain
i seed our mis'ess go into a sort of a park place where there's seats and shrubs and flowers armincrook with a sojer
continued cainy firmly and with a dim sense that his words were very effective as regarded gabriel's emotions
and i think the sojer was sergeant troy
and they sat there together for more than halfanhour talking moving things and she once was crying a'most to death
and when they came out her eyes were shining and she was as white as a lily and they looked into one another's faces as fargone friendly as a man and woman can be
gabriel's features seemed to get thinner
well what did you see besides
oh all sorts
white as a lily
you are sure 'twas she
yes
well what besides
great glass windows to the shops and great clouds in the sky full of rain and old wooden trees in the country round
you stunpoll
what will ye say next
said coggan
let en alone
interposed joseph poorgrass
the boy's meaning is that the sky and the earth in the kingdom of bath is not altogether different from ours here
'tis for our good to gain knowledge of strange cities and as such the boy's words should be suffered so to speak it
and the people of bath
continued cain never need to light their fires except as a luxury for the water springs up out of the earth ready boiled for use
'tis true as the light
testified matthew moon
i've heard other navigators say the same thing
they drink nothing else there
said cain and seem to enjoy it to see how they swaller it down
well it seems a barbarian practice enough to us but i daresay the natives think nothing o' it
said matthew
and don't victuals spring up as well as drink
asked coggan twirling his eye
noi own to a blot there in bath  a true blot
god didn't provide 'em with victuals as well as  and 'twas a drawback i couldn't get over at all
well 'tis a curious place to say the least
observed moon and it must be a curious people that live therein 
miss everdene and the soldier were walking about together you say
said gabriel returning to the group
ay and she wore a beautiful goldcolour silk gown trimmed with black lace that would have stood alone 'ithout legs inside if required
'twas a very winsome sight and her hair was brushed splendid
and when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his red coat  my
how handsome they looked
you could see 'em all the length of the street
and what then
murmured gabriel
and then i went into griffin's to hae my boots hobbed and then i went to riggs's battycake shop and asked 'em for a penneth of the cheapest and nicest stales that were all but bluemouldy but not quite
and whilst i was chawing 'em down i walked on and seed a clock with a face as big as a baking trendle     but that's nothing to do with mistress
i'm coming to that if you'll leave me alone mister oak
remonstrated cainy
if you excites me perhaps you'll bring on my cough and then i shan't be able to tell ye nothing
yeslet him tell it his own way
said coggan
gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience and cainy went on   and there were great large houses and more people all the week long than at weatherbury club walking on white tuesdays
and i went to grand churches and chapels
and how the parson would pray
yes he would kneel down and put up his hands together and make the holy gold rings on his fingers gleam and twinkle in yer eyes that he'd earned by praying so excellent well
 ah yes i wish i lived there
our poor parson thirdly can't get no money to buy such rings
said  matthew moon thoughtfully
and as good a man as ever walked
i don't believe poor thirdly have a single one even of humblest tin or copper
such a great ornament as they'd be to him on a dull afternoon when he's up in the pulpit lighted by the wax candles
but 'tis impossible poor man
ah to think how unequal things be
perhaps he's made of different stuff than to wear em
said gabriel grimly
well that's enough of this
go on cainy  quick
oh  and the new style of parsons wear moustaches and long beards
continued the illustrious traveller and look like moses and aaron complete and make we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the children of israel
a very right feeling  very
said joseph poorgrass
and there's two religions going on in the nation now  high church and high chapel
and thinks i i'll play fair so i went to high church in the morning and high chapel in the afternoon
a right and proper boy
said joseph poorgrass
well at high church they pray singing and worship all the colours of the rainbow and at high chapel they pray preaching and worship drab and whitewash only
and theni didn't see no more of miss everdene at all
why didn't you say so afore then
exclaimed oak with much disappointment
ah
said matthew moon 'she'll wish her cake dough if so be she's over intimate with that man
she's not over intimate with him
said gabriel indignantly
she would know better
said coggan
our mis'ess has too much sense under they knots of black hair to do such a mad thing
you see he's not a coarse ignorant man for he was well brought up
said matthew dubiously
'twas only wildness that made him a soldier and maids rather like your man of sin
now cain ball
said gabriel restlessly can you swear in the most awful form that the woman you saw was miss everdene
cain ball you be no longer a babe and suckling said joseph in the sepulchral tone the circumstances demanded and you know what taking an oath is
'tis a horrible testament mind ye which you say and seal with your bloodstone and the prophet matthew tells us that on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
now before all the workfolk here assembled can you swear to your words as the shep herd asks ye
please no mister oak
said cainy looking from one to the other with great uneasiness at the spiritual magnitude of the position
i don't mind saying 'tis true but i don't like to say 'tis damn true if that's what you mane
cain cain how can you
asked joseph sternly
you be asked to swear in a holy manner and you swear like wicked shimei the son of gera who cursed as he came
young man fie
no i don't
'tis you want to squander a pore boy's soul joseph poorgrass  that's what 'tis
said cain beginning to cry
all i mane is that in common truth 'twas miss everdene and sergeant troy but in the horrible sohelpme truth that ye want to make of it perhaps 'twas somebody else
there's no getting at the rights of it
said gabriel turning to his work
cain ball you'll come to a bit of bread
groaned joseph poorgrass
then the reapers' hooks were flourished again and the old sounds went on
gabriel without making any pretence of being lively did nothing to show that he was particularly dull
however coggan knew pretty nearly how the land lay and when they were in a nook together he said  don't take on about her gabriel
what difference does it make whose sweetheart she is since she can't be yours
that's the very thing i say to myself
said gabriel
chapter xxxiv    home again  a trickster   that same evening at dusk gabriel was leaning over coggan's gardengate taking an upanddown survey before retiring to rest
a vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of the lane
from it spread the tones of two women talking
the tones were natural and not at all suppressed
oak instantly knew the voices to he those of bathsheba and liddy
the carriage came opposite and passed by
it was miss everdene's gig and liddy and her mistress were the only occupants of the seat
liddy was asking questions about the city of bath and her companion was answering them listlessly and unconcernedly
both bathsheba and the horse seemed weary
the exquisite relief of finding that she was here again safe and sound overpowered all reflection and oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it
all grave reports were forgotten
he lingered and lingered on till there was no difference between the eastern and western expanses of sky and the timid hares began to limp courageously round the dim hillocks
gabriel might have been there an additional halfhour when a dark form walked slowly by
goodnight gabriel
the passer said
it was boldwood
goodnight sir
said gabriel
boldwood likewise vanished up the road and oak shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed
farmer boldwood went on towards miss everdene's house
he reached the front and approaching the entrance saw a light in the parlour
the blind was not drawn down and inside the room was bathsheba looking over some papers or letters
her back was towards boldwood
he went to the door knocked and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow
boldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with bathsheba in the road to yalbury
silent and alone he had remained in moody medita tion on woman's ways deeming as essentials of the whole sex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever closely beheld
by degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded him and this was the reason of his sally tonight
he had come to apologize and beg forgiveness of bathsheba with some thing like a sense of shame at his violence having but just now learnt that she had returned  only from a visit to liddy as he supposed the bath escapade being quite unknown to him
he inquired for miss everdene
liddy's manner was odd but he did not notice it
she went in leaving him standing there and in her absence the blind of the room containing bathsheba was pulled down
bold wood augured ill from that sign
liddy came out
my mistress cannot see you sir
she said
the farmer instantly went out by the gate
he as unforgiven  that was the issue of it all
he had seen her who was to him simultaneously a delight and a torture sitting in the room he had shared with her as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in he summer and she had denied him an entrance there now
boldwood did not hurry homeward
it was ten o'clock at least when walking deliberately through the lower part of weatherbury he heard the carrier's spring van entering the village
the van ran to and from a town in a northern direction and it was owned and driven by a weatherbury man at the door of whose house it now pulled up
the lamp fixed to the head of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form who was the first to alight
ah
said boldwood to himself come to see her again
troy entered the carrier's house which had been the place of his lodging on his last visit to his native place
boldwood was moved by a sudden determina tion
he hastened home
in ten minutes he was back again and made as if he were going to call upon troy at the carrier's
but as he approached some one opened the door and came out
he heard this person say  goodnight to the inmates and the voice was troy's
this was strange coming so immediately after his arrival
boldwood however hastened up to him
troy had what appeared to be a carpetbag in his hand  the same that he had brought with him
it seemed as if he were going to leave again this very night
troy turned up the hill and quickened his pace
boldwood stepped forward
sergeant troy
yesi'm sergeant troy
just arrived from up the country i think
just arrived from bath
i am william boldwood
indeed
the tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted to bring boldwood to the point
i wish to speak a word with you
he said
what about
about her who lives just ahead there  and about a woman you have wronged
i wonder at your impertinence
said troy moving on
now look here
said boldwood standing in front of him  wonder or not you are going to hold a conver sation with me
troy heard the dull determination in boldwood's voice looked at his stalwart frame then at the thick cudgel he carried in his hand
he remembered it was past ten o'clock
it seemed worth while to be civil to boldwood
very well i'll listen with pleasure
said troy placing his bag on the ground only speak low for somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse there
well then  i know a good deal concerning your fanny robin's attachment to you
i may say too that i believe i am the only person in the village excepting gabriel oak who does know it
you ought to marry her
i suppose i ought
indeed l wish to but i cannot
why
troy was about to utter something hastily he then checked himself and said i am too poor
his voice was changed
previously it had had a devilmaycare tone
it was the voice of a trickster now
boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to notice tones
he continued i may as well speak plainly and understand i don't wish to enter into the questions of right or wrong woman's honour and shame or to express any opinion on your conduct
i intend a business transaction with you
i see
said troy
suppose we sit down here
an old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately opposite and they sat down
the tone in which this word was uttered was all troy heard the dull determination in boldwood's voice looked at his stalwart frame then at the thick plainly and understand i don't wish to enter into the i was engaged to be married to miss everdene said boldwood but you came and     not engaged
said troy
as good as engaged
if i had not turned up she might have become en gaged to you
hang might
would then
if you had not come i should certainly  yes certainly  have been accepted by this time
if you had not seen her you might have been married to fanny
well there's too much difference between miss ever dene's station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to benefit you by ending in marriage
so all i ask is don't molest her any more
marry fanny
make it worth your while
how will you
i'll pay you well now i'll settle a sum of money upon her and i'll see that you don't suffer from poverty in the future
i'll put it clearly
bathsheba is only playing with you you are too poor for her as i said so give up wasting your time about a great match you'll never make for a moderate and rightful match you may make tomorrow take up your carpetbag turn about leave weatherbury now this night and you shall take fifty pounds with you
fanny shall have fifty to enable her to prepare for the wedding when you have told me where she is living and she shall have five hundred paid down on her weddingday
in making this statement boldwood's voice revealed only too clearly a consciousness of the weakness of his position his aims and his method
his manner had lapsed quite from that of the firm and dignified bold wood of former times and such a scheme as he had now engaged in he would have condemned as childishly imbecile only a few months ago
we discern a grand force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man but there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in the lover we vainly seek
where there is much bias there must be some narrowness and love though added emotion is subtracted capacity
boldwood exemplified this to an abnormal degree he knew nothing of fanny robin's circumstances or whereabouts he knew nothing of troy's possibilities yet that was what he said
i like fanny best
said troy and if as you say miss everdene is out of my reach why i have all to gain by accepting your money and marrying fan
but she's only a servant
never mind  do you agree to my arrangement
i do
ah
said boldwood in a more elastic voice
o troy if you like her best why then did you step in here and injure my happiness
i love fanny best now
said troy
but bathsh    miss everdene inflamed me and displaced fanny for a time
it is over now
why should it be over so soon
and why then did you come here again
there are weighty reasons
fifty pounds at once you said
i did
said boldwood  and here they are  fifty sovereigns
he handed troy a small packet
you have everything ready  it seems that you calculated on my accepting them
said the sergeant taking the packet
i thought you might accept them
said boldwood
you've only my word that the programme shall be adhered to whilst i at any rate have fifty pounds
l had thought of that and l have considered that if i can't appeal to your honour i can trust to your  well shrewdness we'll call it  not to lose five hundred pounds in prospect and also make a bitter enemy of a man who is willing to be an extremely useful friend
stop listen
said troy in a whisper
a light pitpat was audible upon the road just above them
by george  'tis she
he continued
i must go on and meet her
she  who
bathsheba
bathsheba  out alone at this time o' night
said boldwood in amazement and starting up
why must you meet her
she was expecting me tonight  and i must now speak to her and wish her goodbye according to your wish 
i don't see the necessity of speaking
it can do no harm  and she'll be wandering about looking for me if i don't
you shall hear all i say to her
it will help you in your lovemaking when i am gone
your tone is mocking
o no
and remember this if she does not know what has become of me she will think more about me than if i tell her flatly i have come to give her up
will you confine your words to that one point
 shall i hear every word you say
every word
now sit still there and hold my carpet bag for me and mark what you hear
the light footstep came closer halting occasionally as if the walker listened for a sound
troy whistled a double note in a soft fluty tone
come to that is it
murmured boldwood uneasily
you promised silence
said troy
i promise again
troy stepped forward
frank dearest is that you
the tones were bathsheba's
o god
said boldwood
yes
said troy to her
how late you are
she continued tenderly
did you come by the carrier
i listened and heard his wheels entering the village but it was some time ago and i had almost given you up frank
i was sure to come
said frank
you knew i should did you not
well i thought you would
she said playfully and frank it is so lucky
there's not a soul in my house but me tonight
i've packed them all off so nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady's bower
liddy wanted to go to her grandfather's to tell him about her holiday and i said she might stay with them till tomorrow  when you'll be gone again
capital
said troy
but dear me i had better go back for my bag because my slippers and brush and comb are in it you run home whilst i fetch it and i'll promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes
yes
she turned and tripped up the hill again
during the progress of this dialogue there was a nervous twitching of boldwood's tightly closed lips and his face became bathed in a clammy dew
he now started forward towards troy
troy turned to him and took up the bag
shall i tell her i have come to give her up and cannot marry her
said the soldier mockingly
no no wait a minute
i want to say more to you  more to you
said boldwood in a hoarse whisper
now
said troy you see my dilemma
perhaps i am a bad man  the victim of my impulses  led away to do what i ought to leave undone
i can't however marry them both
and i have two reasons for choosing fanny
first i like her best upon the whole and second you make it worth my while
at the same instant boldwood sprang upon him and held him by the neck
troy felt boldwood's grasp slowly tightening
the move was absolutely unexpected
a moment
he gasped
you are injuring her you love
well what do you mean
said the farmer
give me breath
said troy
boldwood loosened his hand saying by heaven i've a mind to kill you
and ruin her
save her
oh how can she be saved now unless i marry her
boldwood groaned
he reluctantly released the soldier and flung him back against the hedge
devil you torture me
said he
troy rebounded like a ball and was about to make a dash at the farmer but he checked himself saying lightly  it is not worth while to measure my strength with you
indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel
i shall shortly leave the army because of the same conviction
now after that revelation of how the land lies with bathsheba 'twould be a mistake to kill me would it not
'twould be a mistake to kill you
repeated boldwood mechanically with a bowed head
better kill yourself
far better
i'm glad you see it
troy make her your wife and don't act upon what i arranged just now
the alternative is dreadful but take bathsheba i give her up
she must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she has done
wretched woman  deluded woman  you are bathsheba
but about fanny
bathsheba is a woman well to do
continued bold wood in nervous anxiety and troy she will make a good wife and indeed she is worth your hastening on your marriage with her 
but she has a willnot to say a temper and i shall be a mere slave to her
i could do anything with poor fanny robin
troy
said boldwood imploringly i'll do anything for you only don't desert her pray don't desert her troy
which poor fanny
no bathsheba everdene
love her best
love her tenderly
how shall i get you to see how advan tageous it will be to you to secure her at once
i don't wish to secure her in any new way
boldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards troy's person again
he repressed the instinct and his form drooped as with pain
troy went on  i shall soon purchase my discharge and then     but i wish you to hasten on this marriage
it will be better for you both
you love each other and you must let me help you to do it
how
why by settling the five hundred on bathsheba instead of fanny to enable you to marry at once
no she wouldn't have it of me
i'll pay it down to you on the weddingday
troy paused in secret amazement at boldwood's wild infatuation
he carelessly said and am i to have anything now
yes if you wish to
but i have not much additional money with me
i did not expect this but all i have is yours
boldwood more like a somnambulist than a wakeful man pulled out the large canvas bag he carried by way of a purse and searched it
i have twentyone pounds more with me
he said
two notes and a sovereign
but before i leave you i must have a paper signed     pay me the money and we'll go straight to her parlour and make any arrangement you please to secure my compliance with your wishes
but she must know nothing of this cash business
nothing nothing
said boldwood hastily
here is the sum and if you'll come to my house we'll write out the agreement for the remainder and the terms also
first we'll call upon her
but why
come with me tonight and go with me tomorrow to the surrogate's
but she must be consulted at any rate informed
very well go on
they went up the hill to bathsheba's house
when they stood at the entrance troy said wait here a moment
opening the door he glided inside leaving the door ajar
boldwood waited
in two minutes a light appeared in the passage
boldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door
troy appeared inside carrying a bedroom candlestick
what did you think i should break in
said boldwood contemptuously
oh no it is merely my humour to secure things
will you read this a moment
i'll hold the light
troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and doorpost and put the candle close
that's the paragraph
he said placing his finger on a line
boldwood looked and read  marriages
on the th inst at st ambrose's church bath by the rev
g mincing ba francis troy only son of the late edward troy esq hd of weatherbury and sergeant with dragoon guards to bathsheba only surviving daughter of the late mr john everdene of casterbridge
this may be called fort meeting feeble hey boldwood
said troy
a low gurgle of derisive laughter followed the words
the paper fell from boldwood's hands
troy continued  fifty pounds to marry fanny good
twenty one pounds not to marry fanny but bathsheba
good
finale  already bathsheba's husband
now boldwood yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter ference between a man and his wife
and another word
bad as i am i am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter of huckster and sale
fanny has long ago left me
don't know where she is
i have searched everywhere
another word yet
you say you love bathsheba yet on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe in her dishonour
a fig for such love
now that i've taught you a lesson take your money back again
i will not i will not
said boldwood in a hiss
anyhow i won't have it
said troy contemptuously
he wrapped the packet of gold in the notes and threw the whole into the road
boldwood shook his clenched fist at him
you juggler of satan
you black hound
but i'll punish you yet mark me i'll punish you yet
another peal of laughter
troy then closed the door and locked himself in
throughout the whole of that night boldwood's dark downs of weatherbury like an unhappy shade in the mournful fields by acheron
chapter xxxv    at an upper window   it was very early the next morning  a time of sun and dew
the confused beginnings of many birds' songs spread into the healthy air and the wan blue of the heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring day
all the lights in the scene were yellow as to colour and all the shadows were attenuated as to form
the creeping plants about the old manorhouse were bowed with rows of heavy water drops which had upon objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high magnifying power
just before the clock struck five gabriel oak and coggan passed the village cross and went on together to the fields
they were yet barely in view of their mistress's house when oak fancied he saw the opening of a casement in one of the upper windows
the two men were at this moment partially screened by an elder bush now beginning to be enriched with black bunches of fruit and they paused before emerging from its shade
a handsome man leaned idly from the lattice
he looked east and then west in the manner of one who makes a first morning survey
the man was sergeant troy
his red jacket was loosely thrown on but not buttoned and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of a soldier taking his ease
coggan spoke first looking quietly at the window
she has married him
he said
gabriel had previously beheld the sight and he now stood with his back turned making no reply
i fancied we should know something today
con tinued coggan
i heard wheels pass my door just after dark  you were out somewhere
he glanced round upon gabriel
good heavens above us oak how white your face is you look like a corpse
do i
said oak with a faint smile
lean on the gate i'll wait a bit
all right all right
they stood by the gate awhile gabriel listlessly staring at the ground
his mind sped into the future and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes o repentance that would ensue from this work of haste that they were married he had instantly decided
why had it been so mysteriously managed
it had become known that she had had a fearful journey to bath owing to her miscalculating the distance  that the horse had broken down and that she had been more than two days getting there
it was not bathsheba's way to do things furtively
with all her faults she was candour itself
could she have been entrapped
the union was not only an unutterable grief to him it amazed him notwithstanding that he had passed the preceding week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of troy's meeting her away from home
her quiet return with liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread
just as that imperceptible motion which appears like stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stili ness itself so had his hope undistinguishable from despair differed from despair indeed
in a few minutes they moved on again towards the house
the sergeant still looked from the window
morning comrades
he shouted in a cheery voice when they came up
coggan replied to the greeting
bain't ye going to answer the man
he then said to gabriel
i'd say good morning  you needn't spend a hapenny of meaning upon it and yet keep the man civil
gabriel soon decided too that since the deed was done to put the best face upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he loved
good morning sergeant troy
he returned in a ghastly voice
a rambling gloomy house this
said troy smiling
why  they may not be married
suggested coggan
perhaps she's not there
gabriel shook his head
the soldier turned a little towards the east and the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow
but it is a nice old house
responded gabriel
yes  i suppose so but i feel like new wine in an old bottle here
my notion is that sashwindows should be put throughout and these old wainscoted walls brightened up a bit or the oak cleared quite away and the walls papered
it would be a pity i think
well no
a philosopher once said in my hearing that the old builders who worked when art was a living thing had no respect for the work of builders who went before them but pulled down and altered as they thought fit and why shouldn't we
'creation and preservation don't do well together
says he and a million of antiquarians can't invent a style
my mind exactly
i am for making this place more modern that we may be cheerful whilst we can
the military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room to assist his ideas of improvement in this direction
gabriel and coggan began to move on
oh coggan
said troy as if inspired by a recollec tion do you know if insanity has ever appeared in mr boldwood's family
jan reflected for a moment
i once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his head but i don't know the rights o't
he said
it is of no importance
said troy lightly
well i shall be down in the fields with you some time this week but i have a few matters to attend to first
so goodday to you
we shall of course keep on just as friendly terms as usual
i'm not a proud man  nobody is ever able to say that of sergeant troy
however what is must be and here's halfacrown to drink my health men
troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot and over the fence towards gabriel who shunned it in its fall his face turning to an angry red
coggan twirled his eye edged forward and caught the money in its ricochet upon the road
very wellyou keep it coggan
said gabriel with disdain and almost fiercely
as for me i'll do with out gifts from him
don't show it too much
said coggan musingly
for if he's married to her mark my words he'll buy his discharge and be our master here
therefore 'tis well to say  friend' outwardly though you say troublehouse' within
wellperhaps it is best to be silent but i can't go further than that
i can't flatter and if my place here is only to be kept by smoothing him down my place must be lost
a horseman whom they had for some time seen in the distance now appeared close beside them
there's mr
boldwood
said oak
i wonder what troy meant by his question
coggan and oak nodded respectfully to the farmer just checked their paces to discover if they were wanted and finding they were not stood back to let him pass on
the only signs of the terrible sorrow boldwood had been combating through the night and was combating now were the want of colour in his welldefined face the enlarged appearance of the veins in his forehead and temples and the sharper lines about his mouth
the horse bore him away and the very step of the animal seemed significant of dogged despair
gabriel for a minute rose above his own grief in noticing boldwood's
he saw the square figure sitting erect upon the horse the head turned to neither side the elbows steady by the hips the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in its onward glide until the keen edges of boldwood's shape sank by degrees over the hill
to one who knew the man and his story there was something more striking in this immobility than in a collapse
the clash of discord between mood and matter here was forced painfully home to the heart and as in laughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears so was there in the steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper than a cry
chapter xxxvi    wealth in jeopardy  the revel   one night at the end of august when bathsheba's experiences as a married woman were still new and when the weather was yet dry and sultry a man stood motionless in the stockyard of weatherbury upper farm looking at the moon and sky
the night had a sinister aspect
a heated breeze from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty objects and in the sky dashes of buoyant cloud were sailing in a course at right angles to that of another stratum neither of them in the direction of the breeze below
the moon as seen through these films had a lurid metallic look
the fields were sallow with the impure light and all were tinged in monochrome as if beheld through stained glass
the same evening the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail the behaviour of the rooks had been confused and the horses had moved with timidity and caution
thunder was imminent and taking some secondary appearances into consideration it was likely to be followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark the close of dry weather for the season
before twelve hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a bygone thing
oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un protected ricks massive and heavy with the rich produce of onehalf the farm for that year
he went on to the barn
this was the night which had been selected by sergeant troy  ruling now in the room of his wife  for giving the harvest supper and dance
as oak approached the building the sound of violins and a tambourine and the regular jigging of many feet grew more distinct
he came close to the large doors one of which stood slightly ajar and looked in
the central space together with the recess at one end was emptied of all incumbrances and this area covering about twothirds of the whole was appropriated for the gathering the remaining end which was piled to the ceiling with oats being screened off with sail cloth
tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls beams and extemporized chandeliers and immediately opposite to oak a rostrum had been erected bearing a table and chairs
here sat three fiddlers and beside them stood a frantic man with his hair on end perspiration streaming down his cheeks and a tambourine quivering in his hand
the dance ended and on the black oak floor in the midst a new row of couples formed for another
now ma'am and no offence i hope i ask what dance you would like next
said the first violin
really it makes no difference
said the clear voice of bathsheba who stood at the inner end of the build ing observing the scene from behind a table covered with cups and viands
troy was lolling beside her
then
said the fiddler i'll venture to name that the right and proper thing is the soldier's joy  there being a gallant soldier married into the farm  hey my sonnies and gentlemen all
it shall be the soldier's joy exclaimed a chorus
thanks for the compliment
said the sergeant gaily taking bathsheba by the hand and leading her to the top of the dance
for though i have pur chased my discharge from her most gracious majesty's regiment of cavalry the th dragoon guards to attend to the new duties awaiting me here i shall continue a soldier in spirit and feeling as long as i live
so the dance began
as to the merits of the soldier's joy
there cannot be and never were two opinions
it has been observed in the musical circles of weatherbury and its vicinity that this melody at the end of threequarters of an hour of thunderous footing still possesses more stimulative properties for the heel and toe than the majority of other dances at their first opening
the soldier's joy has too an additional charm in being so admirably adapted to the tambourine aforesaid  no mean instrument in the hands of a performer who understands the proper convulsions spasms st vitus's dances and fearful frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their highest perfection
the immortal tune ended a fine dd rolling forth from the bassviol with the sonorousness of a cannonade and gabriel delayed his entry no longer
he avoided bathsheba and got as near as possible to the platform where sergeant troy was now seated drinking brandy andwater though the others drank without exception cider and ale
gabriel could not easily thrust himself within speaking distance of the sergeant and he sent a message asking him to come down for a moment
the sergeant said he could not attend
will you tell him then
said gabriel that i only stepped ath'art to say that a heavy rain is sure to fall soon and that something should be done to protect the ricks
m troy says it will not rain
returned the messenger and he cannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets
in juxtaposition with troy oak had a melancholy tendency to look like a candle beside gas and ill at ease he went out again thinking he would go home for under the circumstances he had no heart for the scene in the barn
at the door he paused for a moment  troy was speaking
friends it is not only the harvest home that we are celebrating tonight but this is also a wedding feast
a short time ago i had the happiness to lead to the altar this lady your mistress and not until now have we been able to give any public flourish to the event in weatherbury
that it may be thoroughly well done and that every man may go happy to bed i have ordered to be brought here some bottles of brandy and kettles of hot water
a treblestrong goblet will he handed round to each guest
bathsheba put her hand upon his arm and with upturned pale face said imploringly no  don't give it to them  pray don't frank
it will only do them harm  they have had enough of everything
true  we don't wish for no more thank ye
said one or two
pooh
said the sergeant contemptuously and raised his voice as if lighted up by a new idea
friends
he said we'll send the womenfolk home
'tis time they were in bed
then we cockbirds will have a jolly carouse to ourselves
if any of the men show the white feather let them look elsewhere for a winter's work
bathsheba indignantly left the barn followed by all the women and children
the musicians not looking upon themselves as company
slipped quietly away to their spring waggon and put in the horse
thus troy and the men on the farm were left sole occupants of the place
oak not to appear unneces sarily disagreeable stayed a little while then he too arose and quietly took his departure followed by a friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a second round of grog
gabriel proceeded towards his home
in approach ing the door his toe kicked something which felt and sounded soft leathery and distended like a boxing glove
it was a large toad humbly travelling across the path
oak took it up thinking it might be better to kill the creature to save it from pain but finding it uninjured he placed it again among the grass
he knew what this direct message from the great mother meant
and soon came another
when he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin glistening streak as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged across it
oak's eyes followed the serpentine sheen to the other side where it led up to a huge brown gardenslug which had come indoors tonight for reasons of its own
it was nature's second way of hinting to him that he was to prepare for foul weather
oak sat down meditating for nearly an hour
during this time two black spiders of the kind common in thatched houses promenaded the ceiling ultimately dropping to the floor
this reminded him that if there was one class of manifestation on this matter that he thoroughly understood it was the instincts of sheep
he left the room ran across two or three fields towards the flock got upon a hedge and looked over among them
they were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity ob servable was that on the sudden appearance of oak's head over the fence they did not stir or run away
they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man
but this was not the most noteworthy feature  they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened
there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which the clump of furzebushes stood in the position of a wearer's neck
opinion
he knew now that he was right and that troy was wrong
every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change
but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions
apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold con tinuous rain
the creeping things seemed to know all about the later rain hut little of the interpolated thunderstorm whilst the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the later rain
this complication of weathers being uncommon was all the more to be feared
oak returned to the stackyard
all was silent here and the conical tips of the ricks jutted darkly into the sky
there were five wheatricks in this yard and three stacks of barley
the wheat when threshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack the barley at least forty
their value to bathsheba and indeed to anybody oak mentally estimated by the following simple calcula tion    x    quarters  l  x  quarters  l total    l seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that money can wear  that of necessary food for man and beast  should the risk be run of deteriorating this bulk of corn to less than half its value because of the instability of a woman
never if i can prevent it
said gabriel
such was the argument that oak set outwardly before him
but man even to himself is a palimpsest having an ostensible writing and another beneath the lines
it is possible that there was this golden legend under the utilitarian one i will help to my last effort the woman i have loved so dearly
he went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering the ricks that very night
all was silent within and he would have passed on in the belief that the party had broken up had not a dim light yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish whiteness outside streamed through a knothole in the folding doors
gabriel looked in
an unusual picture met his eye
the candles suspended among the evergreens had burnt down to their sockets and in some cases the leaves tied about them were scorched
many of the lights had quite gone out others smoked and stank grease dropping from them upon the floor
here under the table and leaning against forms and chairs in every conceivable attitude except the perpendicular
were the wretched persons of all the workfolk the hair of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of mops and brooms
in the midst of these shone red and distinct the figure of sergeant troy leaning back in a chair
coggan was on his back with his mouth open huzzing forth snores as were several others the united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming a subdued roar like london from a distance
joseph poorgrass was curled round in the fashion of a hedge hog apparently in attempts to present the least possible portion of his surface to the air and behind him was dimly visible an unimportant remnant of william small bury
the glasses and cups still stood upon the table a waterjug being overturned from which a small rill after tracing its course with marvellous precision down the centre of the long table fell into the neck of the unconscious mark clark in a steady monotonous drip like the dripping of a stalactite in a cave
gabriel glanced hopelessly at the group which with one or two exceptions composed all the ablebodied men upon the farm
he saw at once that if the ricks were to be saved that night or even the next morning he must save them with his own hands
a faint tingting resounded from under coggan's waistcoat
it was coggan's watch striking the hour of two
oak went to the recumbent form of matthew moon who usually undertook the rough thatching of the home stead and shook him
the shaking was without effect
gabriel shouted in his ear where's your thatching beetle and rickstick and spars
under the staddles
said moon mechanically with the unconscious promptness of a medium
gabriel let go his head and it dropped upon the floor like a bowl
he then went to susan tall's husband
where's the key of the granary
no answer
the question was repeated with the same result
to be shouted to at night was evidently less of a novelty to susan tall's husband than to matthew moon
oak flung down tall's head into the corner again and turned away
to be just the men were not greatly to blame for this painful and demoralizing termination to the evening's entertainment
sergeant troy had so strenu ously insisted glass in hand that drinking should be the bond of their union that those who wished to refuse hardly liked to be so unmannerly under the circum stances
having from their youth up been entirely un accustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild ale it was no wonder that they had succumbed one and all with extraordinary uniformity after the lapse of about an hour
gabriel was greatly depressed
this debauch boded ill for that wilful and fascinating mistress whom the faithful man even now felt within him as the embodi ment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless
he put out the expiring lights that the barn might not be endangered closed the door upon the men in their deep and oblivious sleep and went again into the lone night
a hot breeze as if breathed from the parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe fanned him from the south while directly opposite in the north rose a grim misshapen body of cloud in the very teeth of the wind
so unnaturally did it rise that one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below
meanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the southeast corner of the sky as if in terror of the large cloud like a young brood gazed in upon by some monster
going on to the village oak flung a small stone against the window of laban tall's bedroom expecting susan to open it but nobody stirred
he went round to the back door which had been left unfastened for laban's entry and passed in to the foot of the stair case
mrs
tall i've come for the key of the granary to get at the rickcloths
said oak in a stentorian voice
is that you
said mrs susan tall half awake
yes
said gabriel
come along to bed do you drawlatching rogue  keeping a body awake like this 
it isn't laban  'tis gabriel oak
i want the key of the granary
gabriel
what in the name of fortune did you pretend to be laban for
i didn't
i thought you meant     yes you did
what do you want here
the key of the granary
take it then
'tis on the nail
people coming disturbing women at this time of night ought     gabriel took the key without waiting to hear the conclusion of the tirade
ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen dragging four large water proof coverings across the yard and soon two of these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug  two cloths to each
two hundred pounds were secured
three wheatstacks remained open and there were no more cloths
oak looked under the staddles and found a fork
he mounted the third pile of wealth and began operating adopting the plan of sloping the upper sheaves one over the other and in addition filling the interstices with the material of some untied sheaves
so far all was well
by this hurried contrivance bathsheba's property in wheat was safe for at any rate a week or two provided always that there was not much wind
next came the barley
this it was only possible to protect by systematic thatching
time went on and the moon vanished not to reappear
it was the farewell of the ambassador previous to war
the night had a haggard look like a sick thing and there came finally an utter expiration of air from the whole heaven in the form of a slow breeze which might have been likened to a death
and now nothing was heard in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove in the spars and the rustle of thatch in the intervals
chapter xxxvii    the storm  the two together   a light flapped over the scene as if reflected from phosphorescent wings crossing the sky and a rumble filled the air
it was the first move of the approaching storm
the second peal was noisy with comparatively little visible lightning
gabriel saw a candle shining in bath sheba's bedroom and soon a shadow swept to and fro upon the blind
then there came a third flash
manoeuvres of a most extraordinary kind were going on in the vast firmamental hollows overhead
the lightning now was the colour of silver and gleamed in the heavens like a mailed army
rumbles became rattles
gabriel from his elevated position could see over the landscape at least halfadozen miles in front
every hedge bush and tree was distinct as in a line engraving
in a paddock in the same direction was a herd of heifers and the forms of these were visible at this moment in the act of galloping about in the wildest and maddest confusion flinging their heels and tails high into the air their heads to earth
a poplar in the immediate fore ground was like an ink stroke on burnished tin
then the picture vanished leaving the darkness so intense that gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands
he had stuck his rickingrod or poniard as it was indifferently called  a long iron lance polished by handling  into the stack used to support the sheaves instead of the support called a groom used on houses a blue light appeared in the zenith and in some in describable manner flickered down near the top of the rod
it was the fourth of the larger flashes
a moment later and there was a smack  smart clear and short gabriel felt his position to be anything but a safe one and he resolved to descend
not a drop of rain had fallen as yet
he wiped his weary brow and looked again at the black forms of the unprotected stacks
was his life so valuable to him after all
what were his prospects that he should be so chary of running risk when important and urgent labour could not be carried on without such risk
he resolved to stick to the stack
how ever he took a precaution
under the staddles was a long tethering chain used to prevent the escape of errant horses
this he carried up the ladder and sticking his rod through the clog at one end allowed the other end of the chain to trail upon the ground the spike attached to it he drove in
under the shadow of this extemporized lightningconductor he felt himself comparatively safe
before oak had laid his hands upon his tools again out leapt the fifth flash with the spring of a serpent and the shout of a fiend
it was green as an emerald and the reverberation was stunning
what was this the light revealed to him
in the open ground before him as he looked over the ridge of the rick was a dark and apparently female form
could it be that of the only venturesome woman in the parish  bathsheba
the form moved on a step then he could see no more
is that you ma'am
said gabriel to the darkness
who is there
said the voice of bathsheba gabriel
i am on the rick thatching
o gabriel
 and are you
i have come about them
the weather awoke me and i thought of the corn
i am so distressed about it  can we save it any how
i cannot find my husband
is he with you
he is not here
do you know where he is
asleep in the barn
he promised that the stacks should be seen to and now they are all neglected
can i do anything to help
liddy is afraid to come out
fancy finding you here at such an hour
surely i can do something
you can bring up some reedsheaves to me one by one ma'am if you are not afraid to come up the ladder in the dark
said gabriel
every moment is precious now and that would save a good deal of time
it is not very dark when the lightning has been gone a bit
i'll do anything
she said resolutely
she instantly took a sheaf upon her shoulder clambered up close to his heels placed it behind the rod and descended for another
at her third ascent the rick suddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica  every knot in every straw was visible
on the slope in front of him appeared two human shapes black as jet
the rick lost its sheen  the shapes vanished
gabriel turned his head
it had been the sixth flash which had come from the east behind him and the two dark forms on the slope had been the shadows of himself and bathsheba
then came the peal
it hardly was credible that such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a diabolical sound
how terrible
she exclaimed and clutched him by the sleeve
gabriel turned and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding her arm
at the same moment while he was still reversed in his attitude there was more light and he saw as it were a copy of the tall poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn
it was the shadow of that tree thrown across by a secondary flash in the west
the next flare came
bathsheba was on the ground now shouldering another sheaf and she bore its dazzle without flinching  thunder and aliand again ascended with the load
there was then a silence everywhere for four or five minutes and the crunch of the spars as gabriel hastily drove them in could again be distinctly heard
he thought the crisis of the storm had passed
but there came a burst of light
hold on
said gabriel taking the sheaf from her shoulder and grasping her arm again
heaven opened then indeed
the flash was almost too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized and they could only comprehend the magnificence of its beauty
it sprang from east west north south and was a perfect dance of death
the forms of skeletons appeared in the air shaped with blue fire for bones  dancing leaping striding racing around and mingling altogether in unparalleled con fusion
with these were intertwined undulating snakes of green and behind these was a broad mass of lesser light
simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling sky what may be called a shout since though no shout ever came near it it was more of the nature of a shout than of anything else earthly
in the meantime one of the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of gabriel's rod to run invisibly down it down the chain and into the earth
gabriel was almost blinded and he could feel bathsheba's warm arm tremble in his hand  a sensation novel and thrilling enough but love life everything human seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe
oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought and to see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this light when the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a white heat and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with the last crash of those preceding
it was a stupefying blast harsh and pitiless and it fell upon their ears in a dead flat blow without that reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more distant thunder
by the lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the wide domical scoop above it he saw that the tree was sliced down the whole length of its tall straight stem a huge riband of bark being apparently flung off
the other portion remained erect and revealed the bared surface as a strip of white down the front
the lightning had struck the tree
a sulphurous smell filled the air then all was silent and black as a cave in hinnom
we had a narrow escape
said gabriel hurriedly
you had better go down
bathsheba said nothing but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical pants and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response to her frightened pulsations
she descended the ladder and on second thoughts he followed her
the darkness was now impenetrable by the sharpest vision
they both stood still at the bottom side by side
bathsheba appeared to think only of the weather  oak thought only of her just then
at last he said  the storm seems to have passed now at any rate
i think so too
said bathsheba
though there are multitudes of gleams look
the sky was now filled with an incessant light frequent repetition melting into complete continuity as an unbroken sound results from the successive strokes on a gong
nothing serious
said he
i cannot understand no rain falling
but heaven be praised it is all the better for us
i am now going up again
gabriel you are kinder than i deserve
i will stay and help you yet
o why are not some of the others here
they would have been here if they could
said oak in a hesitating way
o i know it all  all
she said adding slowly they are all asleep in the barn in a drunken sleep and my husband among them
that's it is it not
don't think i am a timid woman and can't endure things
i am not certain
said gabriel
i will go and see he crossed to the barn leaving her there alone
he looked through the chinks of the door
all was in total darkness as he had left it and there still arose as at the former time the steady buzz of many snores
he felt a zephyr curling about his cheek and turned
it was bathsheba's breath  she had followed him and was looking into the same chink
he endeavoured to put off the immediate and pain ful subject of their thoughts by remarking gently if you'll come back again miss  ma'am and hand up a few more it would save much time
then oak went back again ascended to the top stepped off the ladder for greater expedition and went on thatching
she followed but without a sheaf gabriel
she said in a strange and impressive voice
oak looked up at her
she had not spoken since he left the barn
the soft and continual shimmer of the dying lightning showed a marble face high against the black sky of the opposite quarter
bathsheba was sitting almost on the apex of the stack her feet gathered up beneath her and resting on the top round of the ladder
yes mistress
he said
i suppose you thought that when i galloped away to bath that night it was on purpose to be married
i did at last  not at first
he answered somewhat surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject was broached
and others thought so too
yes
and you blamed me for it
wella little
i thought so
now i care a little for your good opinion and i want to explain somethingi have longed to do it ever since i returned and you looked so gravely at me
for if i were to die  and i may die soon  it would be dreadful that you should always think mistakenly of me
now listen
gabriel ceased his rustling
i went to bath that night in the full intention of breaking off my engagement to mr
troy
it was owing to circumstances which occurred after i got there that   that we were married
now do you see the matter in a new light
i do  somewhat
i must i suppose say more now that i have begun
and perhaps it's no harm for you are certainly under no delusion that i ever loved you or that i can have any object in speaking more than that object i have mentioned
well i was alone in a strange city and the horse was lame
and at last i didn't know what to do
i saw when it was too late that scandal might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that way
but i was coming away when he suddenly said he had that day seen a woman more beautiful than i and that his constancy could not be counted on unless i at once became his and i was grieved and troubled    she cleared her voice and waited a moment as if to gather breath
and then between jealousy and distraction i married him
she whispered with desperate impetuosity
gabriel made no reply
he was not to blame for it was perfectly true about   about his seeing somebody else
she quickly added
and now i don't wish for a single remark from you upon the subject  indeed i forbid it
i only wanted you to know that misunderstood bit of my history before a time comes when you could never know it
 you want some more sheaves
she went down the ladder and the work proceeded
gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of his mistress up and down and he said to her gently as a mother  i think you had better go indoors now you are tired
i can finish the rest alone
if the wind does not change the rain is likely to keep off
if i am useless i will go
said bathsheba in a flagging cadence
but o if your life should be lost
you are not useless but i would rather not tire you longer
you have done well
and you better
she said gratefully
thank you for your devotion a thousand times gabriel
good nighti know you are doing your very best for me
she diminished in the gloom and vanished and he heard the latch of the gate fall as she passed through
he worked in a reverie now musing upon her story and upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart which had caused her to speak more warmly to him tonight than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to speak as warmly as she chose
he was disturbed in his meditation by a grating noise from the coachhouse
it was the vane on the roof turning round and this change in the wind was the signal for a disastrous rain
chapter xxxviii    rain  one solitary meets another   it was now five o'clock and the dawn was promising to break in hues of drab and ash
the air changed its temperature and stirred itself more vigorously
cool breezes coursed in transparent eddies round oak's face
the wind shifted yet a point or two and blew stronger
in ten minutes every wind of heaven seemed to be roaming at large
some of the thatching on the wheatstacks was now whirled fantas tically aloft and had to be replaced and weighted with some rails that lay near at hand
this done oak slaved away again at the barley
a huge drop of rain smote his face the wind snarled round every corner the trees rocked to the bases of their trunks and the twigs clashed in strife
driving in spars at any point and on any system inch by inch he covered more and more safely from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred pounds
the rain came on in earnest and oak soon felt the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down his back
ultimately he was reduced wellnigh to a homogeneous sop and the dyes of his clothes trickled down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder
the rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo sphere in liquid spines unbroken in continuity between their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him
oak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had been fighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he was fighting against water now  and for a futile love of the same woman
as for her     but oak was generous and true and dis missed his reflections
it was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden morning when gabriel came down from the last stack and thankfully exclaimed it is done
he was drenched weary and sad and yet not so sad as drenched and weary for he was cheered by a sense of success in a good cause
faint sounds came from the barn and he looked that way
figures stepped singly and in pairs through the doors  all walking awkwardly and abashed save the foremost who wore a red jacket and advanced with his hands in his pockets whistling
the others shambled after with a consciencestricken air  the whole procession was not unlike flaxman's group of the suitors tottering on towards the infernal regions under the conduct of mercury
the gnarled shapes passed into the village troy their leader entering the farmhouse
not a single one of them had turned his face to the ricks or apparently bestowed one thought upon their condition
soon oak too went homeward by a different route from theirs
in front of him against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a person walking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella
the man turned and plainly started he was boldwood
how are you this morning sir
said oak
yes it is a wet day
 oh i am well very well i thank you quite well
i am glad to hear it sir
boldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees
you look tired and ill oak
he said then desultorily regarding his companion
i am tired
you look strangely altered sir
i
not a bit of it  i am well enough
what put that into your head
i thought you didn't look quite so topping as you used to that was all
indeed then you are mistaken
said boldwood shortly
nothing hurts me
my constitution is an iron one
i've been working hard to get our ricks covered and was barely in time
never had such a struggle in my life yours of course are safe sir
o yes
boldwood added after an interval of silence   what did you ask oak
your ricks are all covered before this time
no
at any rate the large ones upon the stone staddles
they are not
them under the hedge
no
i forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it
nor the little one by the stile
nor the little one by the stile
i overlooked the ricks this year
then not a tenth of your corn will come to measure sir
possibly not
overlooked them
repeated gabriel slowly to him self
it is difficult to describe the intensely dramatic effect that announcement had upon oak at such a moment
all the night he had been feeling that the neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and isolated  the only instance of the kind within the circuit of the county
yet at this very time within the same parish a greater waste had been going on uncomplained of and disregarded
a few months earlier boldwood's forgetting his husbandry would have been as preposter ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship
oak was just thinking that whatever he himself might have suffered from bathsheba's marriage here was a man who had suffered more when boldwood spoke in a changed voice  that of one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring
oak you know as well as i that things have gone wrong with me lately
i may as well own it
i was going to get a little settled in life but in some way my plan has come to nothing
i thought my mistress would have married you said gabriel not knowing enough of the full depths of boldwood's love to keep silence on the farmer's account and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on his own
however it is so sometimes and nothing happens that we expect
he added with the repose of a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub dued
i daresay i am a joke about the parish
said bold wood as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue and with a miserable lightness meant to express his indifference
o no  i don't think that
 but the real truth of the matter is that there was not as some fancy any jilting on  her part
no engagement ever existed between me and miss ever dene
people say so but it is untrue she never promised me
boldwood stood still now and turned his wild face to oak
o gabriel
he continued i am weak and foolish and i don't know what and i can't fend off my miserable grief

i had some faint belief in the mercy of god till i lost that woman
yes he prepared a gourd to shade me and like the prophet i thanked him and was glad
but the next day he prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it and i feel it is better to die than to live
a silence followed
boldwood aroused himself from the momentary mood of confidence into which he had drifted and walked on again resuming his usual reserve no gabriel
he resumed with a carelessness which was like the smile on the countenance of a skull it was made more of by other people than ever it was by us
i do feel a little regret occasionally but no woman ever had power over me for any length of time
well good morning i can trust you not to mention to others what has passed between us two here
chapter xxxix    coming home  a cry   on the turnpike road between casterbridge and weatherbury and about three miles from the former which pervade the highways of this undulating part of south wessex
i returning from market it is usual for the farmers and other giggentry to alight at the bottom and walk up
one saturday evening in the month of october bathsheba's vehicle was duly creeping up this incline
she was sitting listlessly in the second seat of the gig whilst walking beside her in farmer's marketing suit of unusually fashionable cut was an erect wellmade young man
though on foot he held the reins and whip and occasionally aimed light cuts at the horse's ear with the end of the lash as a recreation
this man was her husband formerly sergeant troy who having bought his discharge with bathsheba's money was gradually transforming himself into a farmer of a spirited and very modern school
people of unalter able ideas still insisted upon calling him sergeant hen they met him which was in some degree owing to his having still retained the wellshaped moustache of his military days and the soldierly bearing insepar able from his form and training
yes if it hadn't been for that wretched rain i should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking my love
he was saying
don't you see it altered all the chances
to speak like a book i once read wet weather is the narrative and fine days are the episodes of our country's history now isn't that true
but the time of year is come for changeable weather
well yes
the fact is these autumn races are the ruin of everybody
never did i see such a day as 'twas
'tis a wild open place just out of budmouth and a drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery
wind and rain  good lord
dark
why 'twas as black as my hat before the last race was run
'twas five o'clock and you couldn't see the horses till they were almost in leave alone colours
the ground was as heavy as lead and all judgment from a fellow's experi ence went for nothing
horses riders people were all blown about like ships at sea
three booths were blown over and the wretched folk inside crawled out upon their hands and knees and in the next field were as many as a dozen hats at one time
aye pimpernel regularly stuck fast when about sixty yards off and when i saw policy stepping on it did knock my heart against the lining of my ribs i assure you my love
and you mean frank
said bathsheba sadly  her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and vivacity of the previous summer  that you have lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful horseracing
o frank it is cruel it is foolish of you to take away my money so
we shall have to leave the farm that will be the end of it
humbug about cruel
now there 'tis again  turn on the waterworks that's just like you
but you'll promise me not to go to budmouth second meeting won't you
she implored
bathsheba was at the full depth for tears but she maintained a dry eye
i don't see why i should in fact if it turns out to be a fine day i was thinking of taking you
never never
i'll go a hundred miles the other way first
i hate the sound of the very word
but the question of going to see the race or staying at home has very little to do with the matter
bets are all booked safely enough before the race begins you may depend
whether it is a bad race for me or a good one will have very little to do with our going there next monday
but you don't mean to say that you have risked anything on this one too
she exclaimed with an agonized look
there now don't you be a little fool
wait till you are told
why bathsheba you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you formerly had and upon my life if i had known what a chickenhearted creature you were under all your boldness i'd never havei know what
a flash of indignation might have been seen in bathsheba's dark eyes as she looked resolutely ahead after this reply
they moved on without further speech some earlywithered leaves from the trees which hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning downward across their path to the earth
a woman appeared on the brow of the hill
the ridge was in a cutting so that she was very near the husband and wife before she became visible
troy had turned towards the gig to remount and whilst putting his foot on the stepthe woman passed behind him
though the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped them in gloom bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the extreme poverty of the woman's garb and the sadness of her face
please sir do you know at what time casterbridge unionhouse closes at night
the woman said these words to troy over his shoulder
troy started visibly at the sound of the voice yet he seemed to recover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving way to his impulse to suddenly turn and face her
he said slowly  i don't know
the woman on hearing him speak quickly looked up examined the side of his face and recognized the soldier under the yeoman's garb
her face was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both among its elements
she uttered an hysterical cry and fell down
o poor thing
exclaimed bathsheba instantly preparing to alight
stay where you are and attend to the horse
said troy peremptorily throwing her the reins and the whip
walk the horse to the top i'll see to the woman
but i   do you hear
clk  poppet
the horse gig and bathsheba moved on
how on earth did you come here
i thought you were miles away or dead
why didn't you write to me
said troy to the woman in a strangely gentle yet hurried voice as he lifted her up
i feared to
have you any money
none
good heaven  i wish i had more to give you
here's    wretched    the merest trifle
it is every farthing i have left
i have none but what my wife gives me you know and i can't ask her now
he woman made no answer
i have only another moment
continued troy and now listen
where are you going tonight
casterbridge union
yes i thought to go there
you shan't go there yet wait
yes perhaps for tonight i can do nothing better  worse luck
sleep there tonight and stay there tomorrow
monday is the first free day i have and on monday morning at ten exactly meet me on grey's bridge just out of the town
i'll bring all the money i can muster
you shan't wanti'll see that fanny then i'll get you a lodging somewhere
goodbye till then
i am a brute   but goodbye
after advancing the distance which completed the ascent of the hill bathsheba turned her head
the woman was upon her feet and bathsheba saw her withdrawing from troy and going feebly down the hill by the third milestone from casterbridge
troy then came on towards his wife stepped into the gig took the reins from her hand and without making any observation whipped the horse into a trot
he was rather agitated
do you know who that woman was
said bath sheba looking searchingly into his face
i do
he said looking boldly back into hers
i thought you did
said she with angry hauteur and still regarding him
who is she
he suddenly seemed to think that frankness would benefit neither of the women
nothing to either of us
he said
i know her by sight
what is her name
how should i know her name
i think you do
think if you will and be     the sentence was completed by a smart cut of the whip round poppet's flank which caused the animal to start forward at a wild pace
no more was said
chapter xl    on casterbridge highway   for a considerable time the woman walked on
her steps became feebler and she strained her eyes to look afar upon the naked road now indistinct amid the penumbrae of night
at length her onward walk dwindled to the merest totter and she opened a gate within which was a haystack
underneath this she sat down and presently slept
when the woman awoke it was to find herself in the depths of a moonless and starless night
a heavy un broken crust of cloud stretched across the sky shutting out every speck of heaven and a distant halo which hung over the town of casterbridge was visible against the black concave the luminosity appearing the brighter by its great contrast with the circumscribing darkness
towards this weak soft glow the woman turned her eyes
if i could only get there
she said
meet him the day after tomorrow god help me
perhaps i shall be in my grave before then
a manorhouse clock from the far depths of shadow struck the hour one in a small attenuated tone
after midnight the voice of a clock seems to lose in breadth as much as in length and to diminish its sonorousness to a thin falsetto
afterwards a light  two lights  arose from the re mote shade and grew larger
a carriage rolled along the road and passed the gate
it probably contained some late dinersout
the beams from one lamp shone for a moment upon the crouching woman and threw her face into vivid relieff
the face was young in the groundwork old in the finish the general contours were flexuous and childlike but the finer lineaments had begun to be sharp and thin
the pedestrian stood up apparently with revived determination and looked around
the road appeared to be familiar to her and she carefully scanned the fence as she slowly walked along
presently there became visible a dim white shape it was another milestone
she drew her fingers across its face to feel the marks
two more
she said
she leant against the stone as a means of rest for a  short interval then bestirred herself and again pursued her way
for a slight distance she bore up bravely afterwards flagging as before
this was beside a lone copsewood wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon the leafy ground showed that woodmen had been faggoting and making hurdles during the day
now there was not a rustle not a breeze not the faintest clash of twigs to keep her company
the woman looked over the gate opened it and went in
close to the entrance stood a row of faggots bound and un bound together with stakes of all sizes
for a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense stillness which signifies itself to be not the end but merely the suspension of a previous motion
her attitude was that of a person who listens either to the external world of sound or to the imagined discourse of thought
a close criticism might have detected signs proving that she was intent on the latter alternative
moreover as was shown by what followed she was oddly exercising the faculty of invention upon the spe ciality of the clever jacquet droz the designer of auto matic substitutes for human limbs
by the aid of the casterbridge aurora and by feeling with her hands the woman selected two sticks from the heaps
these sticks were nearly straight to the height of three or four feet where each branched into a fork like the letter y
she sat down snapped off the small upper twigs and carried the remainder with her into the road
she placed one of these forks under each arm as a crutch tested them timidly threw her whole weight upon them  so little that it was  and swung herself forward
the girl had made for herself a material aid
the crutches answered well
the pat of her feet and the tap of her sticks upon the highway were all the sounds that came from the traveller now
she had passed the last milestone by a good long distance and began to look wistfully towards the bank as if calculating upon another milestone soon
the crutches though so very useful had their limits of power
mechanism only transfers labour being powerless to supersede it and the original amount of exertion was not cleared away it was thrown into the body and arms
she was exhausted and each swing forward became fainter
at last she swayed sideways and fell
here she lay a shapeless heap for ten minutes and more
the morning wind began to boom dully over the flats and to move afresh dead leaves which had lain still since yesterday
the woman desperately turned round upon her knees and next rose to her feet
steadying herself by the help of one crutch she essayed a step then another then a third using the crutches now as walkingsticks only
thus she pro gressed till descending mellstock hill another milestone appeared and soon the beginning of an ironrailed fence came into view
she staggered across to the first post clung to it and looked around
the casterbridge lights were now individually visible it was getting towards morning and vehicles might be hoped for if not expected soon
she listened
there was not a sound of life save that acme and sublimation of all dismal sounds the hark of a fox its three hollow notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the precision of a funeral bell
less than a mile
the woman murmured
no more
she added after a pause
the mile is to the county hall and my restingplace is on the other side casterbridge
a little over a mile and there i am
after an interval she again spoke
five or six steps to a yard  six perhaps
i have to go seventeen hundred yards
a hundred times six six hundred
seventeen times that
o pity me lord
holding to the rails she advanced thrusting one hand forward upon the rail then the other then leaning over it whilst she dragged her feet on beneath
this woman was not given to soliloquy but ex tremity of feeling lessens the individuality of the weak as it increases that of the strong
she said again in the same tone i'll believe that the end lies five posts for ward and no further and so get strength to pass them
this was a practical application of the principle that a halffeigned and fictitious faith is better than no faith at all
she passed five posts and held on to the fifth
i'll pass five more by believing my longedfor spot is at the next fifth
i can do it
she passed five more
it lies only five further
she passed five more
but it is five further
she passed them
that stone bridge is the end of my journey
she said when the bridge over the froom was in view
she crawled to the bridge
during the effort each breath of the woman went into the air as if never to return again
now for the truth of the matter
she said sitting down
the truth is that i have less than half a mile
selfbeguilement with what she had known all the time to be false had given her strength to come over half a mile that she would have been powerless to face in the lump
the artifice showed that the woman by some mysterious intuition had grasped the paradoxical truth that blindness may operate more vigorously than prescience and the shortsighted effect more than the farseeing that limitation and not comprehensiveness is needed for striking a blow
the halfmile stood now before the sick and weary woman like a stolid juggernaut
it was an impassive king of her world
the road here ran across durnover moor open to the road on either side
she surveyed the wide space the lights herself sighed and lay down against a guardstone of the bridge
never was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the traveller here exercised hers
every conceivable aid method stratagem mechanism by which these last desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by a human being unperceived was revolved in her busy brain and dismissed as impracticable
she thought of sticks wheels crawling  she even thought of rolling
but the exertion demanded by either of these latter two was greater than to walk erect
the faculty of con trivance was worn out hopelessness had come at last
no further
she whispered and closed her eyes
from the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of the bridge a portion of shade seemed to detach itself and move into isolation upon the pale white of the road
it glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman
she became conscious of something touching her hand it was softness and it was warmth
she opened her eye's and the substance touched her face
a dog was licking her cheek
he was huge heavy and quiet creature standing darkly against the low horizon and at least two feet higher than the present position of her eyes
whether newfoundland mastiff bloodhound or what not it was impossible to say
he seemed to be of too strange and mysterious a nature to belong to any variety among those of popular nomenclature
being thus assignable to no breed he was the ideal embodiment of canine greatness   a generalization from what was common to all
night in its sad solemn and benevolent aspect apart from its stealthy and cruel side was personified in this form darkness endows the small and ordinary ones among mankind with poetical power and even the suffering woman threw her idea into figure
in her reclining position she looked up to him just as in earlier times she had when standing looked up to a man
the animal who was as homeless as she respectfully withdrew a step or two when the woman moved and seeing that she did not repulse him he licked her hand again
a thought moved within her like lightning
perhaps i can make use of him  i  might do it then
she pointed in the direction of casterbridge and the dog seemed to misunderstand  he trotted on
then finding she could not follow he came back and whined
the ultimate and saddest singularity of woman's effort and invention was reached when with a quickened breath ing she rose to a stooping posture and resting her two little arms upon the shoulders of the dog leant firmly thereon and murmured stimulating words
whilst she sorrowed in her heart she cheered with her voice and what was stranger than that the strong should need encouragement from the weak was that cheerfulness should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection
her friend moved forward slowly and she with small mincing steps moved forward beside him half her weight being thrown upon the animal
sometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking erect from the crutches from the rails
the dog who now thoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity was frantic in his distress on these occasions he would tug at her dress and run forward
she always called him back and it was now to be observed that the woman listened for human sounds only to avoid them
it was evident that she had an object in keeping her presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown
their progress was necessarily very slow
they reached the bottom of the town and the casterbridge lamps lay before them like fallen pleiads as they turned to the left into the dense shade of a deserted avenue of chestnuts and so skirted the borough
thus the town was passed and the goal was reached
on this muchdesired spot outside the town rose a picturesque building
originally it had been a mere case to hold people
the shell had been so thin so devoid of excrescence and so closely drawn over the accommodation granted that the grim character of what was beneath showed through it as the shape of a body is visible under a windingsheet
then nature as if offended lent a hand
masses of ivy grew up completely covering the walls till the place looked like an abbey and it was discovered that the view from the front over the casterbridge chimneys was one of the most magnificent in the county
a neighbouring earl once said that he would give up a year's rental to have at his own door the view enjoyed by the inmates from theirs  and very probably the inmates would have given up the view for his year's rental
this stone edifice consisted of a central mass and two wings whereon stood as sentinels a few slim chimneys now gurgling sorrowfully to the slow wind
in the wall was a gate and by the gate a bellpull formed of a hanging wire
the woman raised herself as high as possible upon her knees and could just reach the handle
she moved it and fell forwards in a bowed attitude her face upon her bosom
it was getting on towards six o'clock and sounds of movement were to be heard inside the building which was the haven of rest to this wearied soul
a little door by the large one was opened and a man appeared inside
he discerned the panting heap of clothes went back for a light and came again
he entered a second time and returned with two women
these lifted the prostrate figure and assisted her in through the doorway
the man then closed the door
how did she get here
said one of the women
the lord knows
said the other
there is a dog outside murmured the overcome traveller
where is he gone
he helped me
i stoned him away
said the man
the little procession then moved forward  the man in front bearing the light the two bony women next supporting between them the small and supple one
thus they entered the house and disappeared
chapter xli    suspicion  fanny is sent for   bathsheba said very little to her husband all that evening of their return from market and he was not disposed to say much to her
he exhibited the un pleasant combination of a restless condition with a silent tongue
the next day which was sunday passed nearly in the same manner as regarded their taciturnity bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon
this was the day before the budmouth races
in the evening troy said suddenly  bathsheba could you let me have twenty pounds
her countenance instantly sank
twenty pounds
she said
the fact is i want it badly
the anxiety upon troy's face was unusual and very marked
lt was a culmination of the mood he had been in all the day
ah
for those races tomorrow
troy for the moment made no reply
her mistake had its advantages to a man who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now
well suppose i do want it for races
he said at last
o frank
bathsheba replied and there was such a volume of entreaty in the words
only such a few weeks ago you said that i was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together and that you would give them all up for me and now won't you give up this one which is more a worry than a pleasure
do frank
come let me fascinate you by all i can do   by pretty words and pretty looks and everything i can think of  to stay at home
say yes to your wife  say yes
the tenderest and softest phases of bathsheba's nature were prominent now  advanced impulsively for his acceptance without any of the disguises and defences which the wariness of her character when she was cool too frequently threw over them
few men could have resisted the arch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful face thrown a little back and sideways in the well known attitude that expresses more than the words it accompanies and which seems to have been designed for these special occasions
had the woman not been his wife troy would have succumbed instantly as it was he thought he would not deceive her longer
the money is not wanted for racing debts at all he said
what is it for
she asked
you worry me a great deal by these mysterious responsibilities frank
troy hesitated
he did not now love her enough to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways
yet it was necessary to be civil
you wrong me by such a suspicious manner he said
such straitwaistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a date
i think that i have a right to grumble a little if i pay
she said with features between a smile and a pout
exactly and the former being done suppose we proceed to the latter
bathsheba fun is all very well but don't go too far or you may have cause to regret something
she reddened
i do that already
she said quickly what do you regret
suspicion that my romance has come to an end
all romances end at marriage
i wish you wouldn't talk like that
you grieve me to my soul by being smart at my expense
you are dull enough at mine
i believe you hate me
not you  only your faults
i do hate them
'twould be much more becoming if you set your self to cure them
come let's strike a balance with the twenty pounds and be friends
she gave a sigh of resignation
i have about that sum here for household expenses
if you must have it take it
very good
thank you
i expect i shall have gone away before you are in to breakfast tomorrow
and must you go
ah
there was a time frank when it would have taken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me
you used to call me darling then
but it doesn't matter to you how my days are passed now
i must go in spite of sentiment
troy as he spoke looked at his watch and apparently actuated by non lucendo principles opened the case at the back revealing snugly stowed within it a small coil of hair
bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment and she saw the action and saw the hair
she flushed in pain and surprise and some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it was wise to utter them
a woman's curl of hair
she said
o frank whose is that
troy had instantly closed his watch
he carelessly replied as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred
why yours of course
whose should it be
i had quite forgotten that i had it
what a dreadful fib frank
i tell you i had forgotten it
he said loudly
i don't mean that  it was yellow hair
nonsense
that's insulting me
i know it was yellow
now whose was it
i want to know
very well i'll tell you so make no more ado
it is the hair of a young woman i was going to marry before i knew you
you ought to tell me her name then
i cannot do that
is she married yet
no
is she alive
yes
is she pretty
yes
it is wonderful how she can be poor thing under such an awful affliction
affliction  what affliction
he inquired quickly
having hair of that dreadful colour
oh  hoi like that
said troy recovering him self
why her hair has been admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose which has not been long
it is beautiful hair
people used to turn their heads to look at it poor girl
pooh
that's nothing  that's nothing
she ex claimed in incipient accents of pique
if i cared for your love as much as i used to i could say people had turned to look at mine
bathsheba don't be so fitful and jealous
you knew what married life would be like and shouldn't have entered it if you feared these contingencies
troy had by this time driven her to bitterness her heart was big in her throat and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full
ashamed as she was to show emotion at last she burst out  this is all i get for loving you so well
ah
when i married you your life was dearer to me than my own
i would have died for you  how truly i can say that i would have died for you
and now you sneer at my foolishness in marrying you
o
is it kind to me to throw my mistake in my face
whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom you should not tell me of it so mercilessly now that i am in your power
i can't help how things fall out
said troy upon my heart women will be the death of me
well you shouldn't keep people's hair
you'll burn it won't you frank
frank went on as if he had not heard her
there are considerations even before my consideration for you reparations to be made  ties you know nothing of if you repent of marrying so do i
trembling now she put her hand upon his arm saying in mingled tones of wretchedness and coaxing i only repent it if you don't love me better than any woman in the world
i don't otherwise frank
you don't repent because you already love somebody better than you love me do you
i don't know
why do you say that
you won't burn that curl
you like the woman who owns that pretty hair  yes it is pretty  more beautiful than my miserable black mane
well it is no use i can't help being ugly
you must like her best if you will
until today when i took it from a drawer i have never looked upon that bit of hair for several months  that i am ready to swear
but just now you said ties and then  that woman we met
'twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair
is it hers then
yes
there now that you have wormed it out of me i hope you are content
and what are the ties
oh
that meant nothing  a mere jest
a mere jest
she said in mournful astonishment
can you jest when i am so wretchedly in earnest
tell me the truth frank
i am not a fool you know although i am a woman and have my woman's moments
come
treat me fairly
she said looking honestly and fearlessly into his face
i don't want much bare justice  that's all
ah
once i felt i could be content with nothing less than the highest homage from the husband i should choose
now anything short of cruelty will content me
yes
the independent and spirited bathsheba is come to this
for heaven's sake don't be so desperate
troy said snappishly rising as he did so and leaving the room
directly he had gone bathsheba burst into great sobs  dryeyed sobs which cut as they came without any softening by tears
but she determined to repress all evidences of feeling
she was conquered but she would never own it as long as she lived
her pride was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her own
she chafed to and fro in rebelliousness like a caged leopard her whole soul was in arms and the blood fired her face
until she had met troy bath sheba had been proud of her position as a woman it had been a glory to her to know that her lips had been touched by no man's on earth  that her waist had never been encircled by a lover's arm
she hated herself now
in those earlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for girls who were the slaves of the first goodlooking young fellow who should choose to salute them
she had never taken kindly to the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about her
in the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to marry him but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours on this account was rather that of selfsacrifice than of promotion and honour
although she scarcely knew the divinity's name diana was the goddess whom bathsheba instinctively adored
that she had never by look word or sign encouraged a man to approach her  that she had felt herself sufficient to herself and had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied there was a certain degradation in renouncing the simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler half of an indifferent matrimonial whole  were facts now bitterly remembered
o if she had never stooped to folly of this kind respectable as it was and could only stand again as she had stood on the hill at norcombe and dare troy or any other man to pollute a hair of her head by his interference
the next morning she rose earlier than usual and had the horse saddled for her ride round the farm in the customary way
when she came in at halfpast eight  their usual hour for breakfasting  she was in formed that her husband had risen taken his breakfast and driven off to casterbridge with the gig and poppet
after breakfast she was cool and collected  quite herself in fact  and she rambled to the gate intending to walk to another quarter of the farm which she still personally superintended as well as her duties in the house would permit continually however finding her self preceded in forethought by gabriel oak for whom she began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister
of course she sometimes thought of him in the light of an old lover and had momentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband would have been like also of life with boldwood under the same conditions
but bathsheba though she could feel was not much given to futile dreaming and her musings under this head were short and entirely confined to the times when troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident
she saw coming up the road a man like mr boldwood
it was mr boldwood
bathsheba blushed painfully and watched
the farmer stopped when still a long way off and held up his hand to gabriel oak who was in a footpath across the field
the two men then approached each other and seemed to engage in earnest conversation
thus they continued for a long time
joseph poor grass now passed near them wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to bathsheba's residence
boldwood and gabriel called to him spoke to him for a few minutes and then all three parted joseph immediately coming up the hill with his barrow
bathsheba who had seen this pantomime with some surprise experienced great relief when boldwood turned back again
well what's the message joseph
she said
he set down his barrow and putting upon himself the refined aspect that a conversation with a lady re quired spoke to bathsheba over the gate
you'll never see fanny robin no more  use nor principal  ma'am
why
because she's dead in the union
fanny dead  never
yes ma'am
what did she die from
i don't know for certain but i should be inclined to think it was from general weakness of constitution
she was such a limber maid that 'a could stand no hardship even when i knowed her and 'a went like a candlesnoff so 'tis said
she was took bad in the morning and being quite feeble and worn out she died in the evening
she belongs by law to our parish and mr boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her
indeed i shall not let mr boldwood do any such thingi shall do it
fanny was my uncle's servant and although i only knew her for a couple of days fanny is sent for she belongs to me
how very very sad this is
 the idea of fanny being in a workhouse
bathsheba had begun to know what suffering was and she spoke with real feeling send across to mr boldwood's and say that mrs
troy will take upon herself the duty of fetching an old servant of the family we ought not to put her in a waggon we'll get a hearse
there will hardly be time ma'am will there
perhaps not
she said musingly
when did you say we must be at the door  three o'clock
three o'clock this afternoon ma'am so to speak it
very wellyou go with it
a pretty waggon is better than an ugly hearse after all
joseph have the new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels and wash it very clean
and joseph     yes ma'am
carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her coffin   indeed gather a great many and completely bury her in them
get some boughs of laurustinus and variegated box and yew and boy'siove ay and some hunches of chrysanthemum
and let old pleasant draw her because she knew him so well
i will ma'am
i ought to have said that the union in the form of four labouring men will meet me when i gets to our churchyard gate and take her and bury her according to the rites of the board of guardians as by law ordained
dear me  casterbridge union  and is fanny come to this
said bathsheba musing
i wish i had known of it sooner
i thought she was far away
how long has she lived there
on'y been there a day or two
oh
 then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate
no
she first went to live in a garrisontown t'other side o' wessex and since then she's been picking up a living at seampstering in melchester for several months at the house of a very respectable widowwoman who takes in work of that sort
she only got handy the unionhouse on sunday morning 'a b'lieve and 'tis sup posed here and there that she had traipsed every step of the way from melchester
why she left her place i can't say for i don't know and as to a lie why i wouldn't tell it
that's the short of the story ma'am
ahh
no gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than changed the young wife's counten ance whilst this word came from her in a longdrawn breath
did she walk along our turnpikeroad
she said in a suddenly restless and eager voice
i believe she did ma'am shall i call liddy
you bain't well ma'am surely
you look like a lily  so pale and fainty
no don't call her it is nothing
when did she pass weatherbury
last saturday night
that will do joseph now you may go
certainly ma'am
joseph come hither a moment
what was the colour of fanny robin's hair
really mistress now that 'tis put to me so judge andjury like i can't call to mind if ye'll believe me
never mind go on and do what i told you
stop   well no go on
she turned herself away from him that he might no longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly upon her and went indoors with a distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow
about an hour after she heard the noise of the waggon and went out still with a painful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look
joseph dressed in his best suit of clothes was putting in the horse to start
the shrubs and flowers were all piled in the waggon as she had directed bathsheba hardly saw them now
whose sweetheart did you say joseph
i don't know ma'am
are you quite sure
yes ma'am quite sure
sure of what
i'm sure that all i know is that she arrived in the morning and died in the evening without further parley
what oak and mr boldwood told me was only these few words
little fanny robin is dead joseph' gabriel said looking in my face in his steady old way
i was very sorry and i said ah
 and how did she come to die'
well she's dead in casterhridge union' he said and perhaps 'tisn't much matter about how she came to die
she reached the union early sunday morning and died in the afternoon  that's clear enough'
then i asked what she'd been doing lately and mr boldwood turned round to me then and left off spitting a thistle with the end of his stick
he told me about her having lived by seampstering in melchester as i mentioned to you and that she walked therefrom at the end of last week passing near here saturday night in the dusk
they then said i had better just name a hint of her death to you and away they went
her death might have been brought on by biding in the night wind you know ma'am for people used to say she'd go off in a decline she used to cough a good deal in winter time
however 'tisn't much odds to us about that now for 'tis all over
have you heard a different story at all'
she looked at him so intently that joseph's eyes quailed
not a word mistress i assure 'ee
he said
hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet
i wonder why gabriel didn't bring the message to me himself
he mostly makes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand
these words were merely murmured and she was looking upon the ground
perhaps he was busy ma'am
joseph suggested
and sometimes he seems to suffer from things upon his mind connected with the time when he was better off than 'a is now
'a's rather a curious item but a very understanding shepherd and learned in books
did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about this
i cannot but say that there did ma'am
he was terrible down and so was farmer boldwood
thank you joseph
that will do
go on now or you'll be late
bathsheba still unhappy went indoors again
in the course of the afternoon she said to liddy who had been informed of the occurrence  what was the colour of poor fanny robin's hair
do you know
i cannot recollecti only saw her for a day or two
it was light ma'am but she wore it rather short and packed away under her cap so that you would hardly notice it
but i have seen her let it down when she was going to bed and it looked beautiful then
real golden hair
her young man was a soldier was he not
yes
in the same regiment as mr
troy
he says he knew him very well
what mr
troy says so
how came he to say that
one day i just named it to him and asked him if he knew fanny's young man
he said o yes he knew the young man as well as he knew himself and that there wasn't a man in the regiment he liked better
ah
said that did he
yes and he said there was a strong likeness be tween himself and the other young man so that some times people mistook them     liddy for heaven's sake stop your talking
said bathsheba with the nervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions
chapter xlii    joseph and his burden   a wall bounded the site of casterbridge union house except along a portion of the end
here a high gable stood prominent and it was covered like the front with a mat of ivy
in this gable was no window chimney ornament or protuberance of any kind
the single feature appertaining to it beyond the expanse of dark green leaves was a small door
the situation of the door was peculiar
the sill was three or four feet above the ground and for a moment one was at a loss for an explanation of this exceptional altitude till ruts immediately beneath sug gested that the door was used solely for the passage of articles and persons to and from the level of a vehicle standing on the outside
upon the whole the door seemed to advertise itself as a species of traitor's gate translated to another sphere
that entry and exit hereby was only at rare intervals became apparent on noting that tufts of grass were allowed to flourish undis turbed in the chinks of the sill
as the clock over the southstreet almshouse pointed to five minutes to three a blue spring waggon picked out with red and containing boughs and flowers passed the end of the street and up towards this side of the building
whilst the chimes were yet stammering out a shattered form of malbrook
joseph poorgrass rang the bell and received directions to back his waggon against the high door under the gable
the door then opened and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the vehicle
one of the men then stepped up beside it took from his pocket a lump of chalk and wrote upon the cover the name and a few other words in a large scrawling hand
we believe that they do these things more tenderly now and provide a plate
he covered the whole with a black cloth threadbare but decent the tailboard of the waggon was returned to its place one of the men handed a certificate of registry to poorgrass and both entered the door closing it behind them
their connection with her short as it had been was over for ever
joseph then placed the flowers as enjoined and the evergreens around the flowers till it was difficult to divine what the waggon contained he smacked his whip and the rather pleasing funeral car crept down the hill and along the road to weatherbury
the afternoon drew on apace and looking to the right towards the sea as he walked beside the horse poor grass saw strange clouds and scrolls of mist rolling over the long ridges which girt the landscape in that quarter
they came in yet greater volumes and indolently crept across the intervening valleys and around the withered papery flags of the moor and river brinks
then their dank spongy forms closed in upon the sky
it was a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had their roots in the neighbouring sea and by the time that horse man and corpse entered yalbury great wood these silent workings of an invisible hand had reached them and they were completely enveloped this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs and the first fog of the series
the air was as an eye suddenly struck blind
the waggon and its load rolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and opacity but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor throughout
there was no perceptible motion in the air not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches birches and firs composing the wood on either side
the trees stood in an attitude of intentness as if they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock them
a startling quiet overhung all surrounding things   so completely that the crunching of the waggon wheels was as a great noise and small rustles which had never obtained a hearing except by night were dis tinctly individualized
joseph poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus then at the unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on each hand indistinct shadowless and spectrelike in their monochrome of grey
he felt anything but cheer ful and wished he had the company even of a child or dog
stopping the home he listened
not a footstep or wheel was audible anywhere around and the dead silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart rap upon the coffin of poor fanny
the fog had by this time saturated the trees and this was the first dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves
the hollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully of the grim leveller
then hard by came down another drop then two or three
presently there was a continual tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves the road and the travellers
the nearer boughs were beaded with the mist to the greyness of aged men and the rusty red leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops like diamonds on auburn hair
at the roadside hamlet called roytown just beyond this wood was the old inn buck's head
it was about a mile and a half from weatherbury and in the meridian times of stagecoach travelling had been the place where many coaches changed and kept their relays of horses
all the old stabling was now pulled down and little remained besides the habitable inn itself which standing a little way back from the road sig nified its existence to people far up and down the highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough of an elm on the opposite side of the way
travellers   for the variety tourist had hardly developed into a distinct species at this date  some times said in passing when they cast their eyes up to the signbearing tree that artists were fond of repre senting the signboard hanging thus but that they themselves had never before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working order
it was near this tree that the waggon was standing into which gabriel oak crept on his first journey to weatherbury but owing to the darkness the sign and the inn had been un observed
the manners of the inn were of the oldestablished type
indeed in the minds of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formulae  eg
 rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor
for tobacco shout
in calling for the girl in waiting say maid
ditto for the landlady old soul
etc etc
it was a relief to joseph's heart when the friendly signboard came in view and stopping his horse immediately beneath it he proceeded to fulfil an intention made a long time before
his spirits were oozing out of him quite
he turned the horse's head to the green bank and entered the hostel for a mug of ale
going down into the kitchen of the inn the floor of which was a step below the passage which in its turn was a step below the road outside what should joseph see to gladden his eyes but two coppercoloured discs in the form of the countenances of mr jan coggan and mr mark clark
these owners of the two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood within the pale of respectability were now sitting face to face over a threelegged circular table having an iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally elbowed off they might have been said to resemble the setting sun and the full moon shining visavis across the globe
why 'tis neighbour poorgrass
said mark clark
i'm sure your face don't praise your mistress's table joseph
i've had a very pale companion for the last four miles
said joseph indulging in a shudder toned down by resignation
and to speak the truth 'twas beginning to tell upon me
i assure ye i ha'n't seed the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time this morning and that was no more than a dewbit afield
then drink joseph and don't restrain yourself
said coggan handing him a hooped mug three quarters full
joseph drank for a moderately long time then for a longer time saying as he lowered the jug 'tis pretty drinking  very pretty drinking and is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand so to speak it
true drink is a pleasant delight
said jan as one who repeated a truism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over his tongue and lifting the cup coggan tilted his head gradually backwards with closed eyes that his expectant soul might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings
well i must be on again
said poorgrass
not but that i should like another nip with ye but the parish might lose confidence in me if i was seed here
where be ye trading o't to today then joseph
back to weatherbury
i've got poor little fanny robin in my waggon outside and i must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her
ayi've heard of it
and so she's nailed up in parish boards after all and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave halfcrown
the parish pays the grave halfcrown but not the bell shilling because the bell's a luxery but 'a can hardly do without the grave poor body
however i expect our mistress will pay all
a pretty maid as ever i see
but what's yer hurry joseph
the pore woman's dead and you can't bring her to life and you may as well sit down comfortable and finish another with us
i don't mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more with ye sonnies
but only a few minutes because 'tis as 'tis
of course you'll have another drop
a man's twice the man afterwards
you feel so warm and glorious and you whop and slap at your work without any trouble and everything goes on like sticks a breaking
too much liquor is bad and leads us to that horned man in the smoky house but after all many people haven't the gift of enjoying a wet and since we be highly favoured with a power that way we should make the most o'ttrue
said mark clark
'tis a talent the lord has mercifully bestowed upon us and we ought not to neglect it
but what with the parsons and clerks and schoolpeople and serious teaparties the merry old ways of good life have gone to the dogs  upon my carcase they have
well really i must be onward again now
said joseph
now now joseph nonsense
the poor woman is dead isn't she and what's your hurry
well i hope providence won't be in a way with me for my doings
said joseph again sitting down
i've been troubled with weak moments lately 'tis true
i've been drinky once this month already and i did not go to church asunday and i dropped a curse or two yesterday so i don't want to go too far for my safety
your next world is your next world and not to be squandered offhand
i believe ye to be a chapelmember joseph
that i do
oh no no
i don't go so far as that
for my part
said coggan i'm staunch church of england
ay and faith so be i
said mark clark
i won't say much for myself i don't wish to coggan continued with that tendency to talk on principles which is characteristic of the barleycorn
but i've never changed a single doctrine  i've stuck like a plaster to the old faith i was born in
yes there's this to be said for the church a man can belong to the church and bide in his cheerful old inn and never trouble or worry his mind about doctrines at all
but to be a meetinger you must go to chapel in all winds and weathers and make yerself as frantic as a skit
not but that chapel members be clever chaps enough in their way
they can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads all about their families and shipwrecks in the newspaper
they can  they can
said mark clark with cor roborative feeling but we churchmen you see must have it all printed aforehand or dang it all we should no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the lord than babes unborn chapelfolk be more handinglove with them above than we
said joseph thoughtfully
yes
said coggan
we know very well that if anybody do go to heaven they will
they've worked hard for it and they deserve to have it such as 'tis
i bain't such a fool as to pretend that we who stick to the church have the same chance as they because we know we have not
but i hate a feller who'll change his old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting to heaven
i'd as soon turn king'sevidence for the few pounds you get
why neighbours when every one of my taties were frosted our parson thirdly were the man who gave me a sack for seed though he hardly had one for his own use and no money to buy 'em
if it hadn't been for him i shouldn't hae had a tatie to put in my garden
d'ye think i'd turn after that
no i'll stick to my side and if we be in the wrong so be it  i'll fall with the fallen
well said  very well said
observed joseph
 however folks i must be moving now upon my life i must
pa'son thirdly will be waiting at the church gates and there's the woman abiding outside in the waggon
joseph poorgrass don't be so miserable
pa'son thirdly won't mind
he's a generous man he's found me in tracts for years and i've consumed a good many in the course of a long and shady life but he's never been the man to cry out at the expense
sit down
the longer joseph poorgrass remained the less his spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon
the minutes glided by uncounted until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points on the surface of darkness
coggan's repeater struck six from his pocket in the usual still small tones
at that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry and the door opened to admit the figure of gabriel oak followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle
he stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces of the sitters which confronted him with the expressions of a fiddle and a couple of warmingpans
joseph poor grass blinked and shrank several inches into the back ground
upon my soul i'm ashamed of you 'tis disgraceful joseph disgraceful
said gabriel indignantly
coggan you call yourself a man and don't know better than this
coggan looked up indefinitely at oak one or other of his eyes occasionally opening and closing of its own accord as if it were not a member but a dozy individual with a distinct personality
don't take on so shepherd
said mark clark looking reproachfully at the candle which appeared to possess special features of interest for his eyes
nobody can hurt a dead woman
at length said coggan with the precision of a machine
all that could be done for her is done  she's beyond us  and why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for lifeless clay that can neither feel nor see and don't know what you do with her at all
if she'd been alive i would have been the first to help her
if she now wanted victuals and drink i'd pay for it money down
but she's dead and no speed of ours will bring her to life
the woman's past us  time spent upon her is throwed away why should we hurry to do what's not required
drink shepherd and be friends for tomorrow we may be like her
we may
added mark clark emphatically at once drinking himself to run no further risk of losing his chance by the event alluded to jan meanwhile merging his additional thoughts of tomorrow in a song   tomorrow tomorrow
and while peace and plenty i find at my board with a heart free from sickness and sorrow with my friends will i share what today may afford and let them spread the table tomorrow
tomor  row' tomor  do hold thy horning jan
said oak and turning upon poorgrass  as for you joseph who do your wicked deeds in such confoundedly holy ways you are as drunk as you can stand
no shepherd oak no
listen to reason shepherd
all that's the matter with me is the affliction called a multiplying eye and that's how it is i look double to youi mean you look double to me
a multiplying eye is a very bad thing
said mark clark
it always comes on when i have been in a public  house a little time
said joseph poorgrass meekly
yes i see two of every sort as if i were some holy man living in the times of king noah and entering into the ark
yyyyes
he added becoming much affected by the picture of himself as a person thrown away and shedding tears i feel too good for england i ought to have lived in genesis by rights like the other men of sacrifice and then i shouldn't have bbbeen called a dddrunkard in such a way
i wish you'd show yourself a man of spirit and not sit whining there
show myself a man of spirit
 ah well
let me take the name of drunkard humblyiet me be a man of contrite kneesiet it be
l know that i always do say please god afore i do anything from my getting up to my going down of the same and i be willing to take as much disgrace as there is in that holy act
hah yes

but not a man of spirit
have i ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted against my hinder parts without groaning manfully that i question the right to do so
i inquire that query boldly
we can't say that you have hero poorgrass admitted jan never have i allowed such treatment to pass un questioned
yet the shepherd says in the face of that rich testimony that i be not a man of spirit
well let it pass by and death is a kind friend
gabriel seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to cake charge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey made no reply but closing the door again upon them went across to where the vehicle stood now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy time
he pulled the horse's head from the large patch of turf it had eaten bare readjusted the boughs over the coffin and drove along through the unwholesome night
it had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be brought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate fanny robin who had followed the eleventh from casterbridge through melchester and onwards
but thanks to boldwood's reticence and oak's generosity the lover she had followed had never been individualized as troy
gabriel hoped that the whole truth of the matter might not be published till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few days when the interposing barriers of earth and time and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut into oblivion would deaden the sting that revelation and invidious remark would have for bathsheba just now
by the time that gabriel reached the old manor house her residence which lay in his way to the church it was quite dark
a man came from the gate and said through the fog which hung between them like blown flour  is that poorgrass with the corpse
gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson
the corpse is here sir
said gabriel
i have just been to inquire of mrs
troy if she could tell me the reason of the delay
i am afraid it is too late now for the funeral to be performed with proper decency
have you the registrar's certificate
no
said gabriel
i expect poorgrass has that and he's at the buck's head
i forgot to ask him for it
then that settles the matter
we'll put off the funeral till tomorrow morning
the body may be brought on to the church or it may be left here at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning
they waited more than an hour and have now gone home
gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable plan notwithstanding that fanny had been an inmate of the farmhouse for several years in the lifetime of bathsheba's uncle
visions of several unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay flitted before him
but his will was not law and he went indoors to inquire of his mistress what were her wishes on the subject
he found her in an unusual mood  her eyes as she looked up to him were suspicious and perplexed as with some antecedent thought
troy had not yet returned
at first bathsheba assented with a mien of indifference to his proposition that they should go on to the church at once with their burden but immediately afterwards following gabriel to the gate she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on fanny's account and desired that the girl might be brought into the house
oak argued upon the convenience of leaving her in the waggon just as she lay now with her flowers and green leaves about her merely wheeling the vehicle into the coachhouse till the morning but to no purpose it is unkind and unchristian
she said to leave the poor thing in a coachhouse all night
very well then
said the parson
and i will arrange that the funeral shall take place early to morrow
perhaps mrs
troy is right in feeling that we cannot treat a dead fellowcreature too thoughtfully we must remember that though she may have erred grievously in leaving her home she is still our sister and it is to be believed that god's uncovenanted mercies are extended towards her and that she is a member of the flock of christ
the parson's words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet unperturbed cadence and gabriel shed an honest tear
bathsheba seemed unmoved
mr thirdly then left them and gabriel lighted a lantern
fetching three other men to assist him they bore the unconscious truant indoors placing the coffin on two benches in the middle of a little sittingroom next the hall as bathsheba directed
every one except gabriel oak then left the room
he still indecisively lingered beside the body
he was deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with regard to troy's wife and at his own powerlessness to counteract them n spite of his careful manoeuvring all this day the very worst event that could in any way have happened in connection with the burial had happened now
oak imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after noon's work that might cast over bathsheba's life a shade which the interposition of many lapsing years might but indifferently lighten and which nothing at all might altogether remove
suddenly as in a last attempt to save bathsheba from at any rate immediate anguish he looked again as he had looked before at the chalk writing upon the coffinlid
the scrawl was this simple one  fanny robin and child
gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully rubbed out the two latter words leaving visible the inscription fanny robin only
he then left the room and went out quietly by the front door
chapter xliii    fanny's revenge   do you want me any longer ma'am 
inquired liddy at a later hour the same evening standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in her hand and addressing bathsheba who sat cheerless and alone in the large parlour beside the first fire of the season
no more tonight liddy
i'll sit up for master if you like ma'am
i am not at all afraid of fanny if i may sit in my own room and have a candle
she was such a childlike nesh young thing that her spirit couldn't appear to anybody if it tried i'm quite sure
o no no
you go to bed
i'll sit up for him myself till twelve o'clock and if he has not arrived by that time i shall give him up and go to bed too
it is halfpast ten now
oh
is it
why don't you sit upstairs ma'am
why don't i
said bathsheba desultorily
it isn't worth while  there's a fire here liddy
she suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper have you heard anything strange said of fanny
the words had no sooner escaped her than an expres sion of unutterable regret crossed her face and she burst into tears
no  not a word
said liddy looking at the weeping woman with astonishment
what is it makes you cry so ma'am has anything hurt you
she came to bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy
no liddyi don't want you any more
i can hardly say why i have taken to crying lately i never used to cry
goodnight
liddy then left the parlour and closed the door
bathsheba was lonely and miserable now not lone lier actually than she had been before her marriage but her loneliness then was to that of the present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a cave
and within the last day or two had come these disquieting thoughts about her husband's past
her wayward sentiment that evening concerning fanny's temporary restingplace had been the result of a strange complication of impulses in bathsheba's bosom
per haps it would be more accurately described as a determined rebellion against her prejudices a revulsion from a lower instinct of uncharitableness which would have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman be cause in life she had preceded bathsheba in the atten tions of a man whom bathsheba had by no means ceased from loving though her love was sick to death just now with the gravity of a further misgiving
in five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door
liddy reappeared and coming in a little way stood hesitating until at length she saidmaryann has just heard something very strange but i know it isn't true
and we shall be sure to know the rights of it in a day or two
what is it
oh nothing connected with you or us ma'am
it is about fanny
that same thing you have heard
i have heard nothing
i mean that a wicked story is got to weatherbury within this last hour  that    liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the remainder of the sentence slowly into her ear inclining her head as she spoke in the direction of the room where fanny lay
bathsheba trembled from head to foot
i don't believe it
she said excitedly
and there's only one name written on the coffincover
nor i ma'am
and a good many others don't for we should surely have been told more about it if it had been true  don't you think so ma'am
we might or we might not
bathsheba turned and looked into the fire that liddy might not see her face
finding that her mistress was going to say no more liddy glided out closed the door softly and went to bed
bathsheba's face as she continued looking into the fire that evening might have excited solicitousness on her account even among those who loved her least
the sadness of fanny robin's fate did not make bath sheba's glorious although she was the esther to this poor vashti and their fates might be supposed to stand in some respects as contrasts to each other
when liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful eyes which met hers had worn a listless weary look when she went out after telling the story they had ex pressed wretchedness in full activity
her simple country nature fed on oldfashioned principles was troubled by that which would have troubled a woman of the world very little both fanny and her child if she had one being dead
bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own history and the dimly suspected tragedy of fanny's end which oak and boldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing
the meeting with the lonely woman on the previous saturday night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of
oak may have had the best of intentions in withholding for as many days as possible the details of what had happened to fanny but had he known that bathsheba's perceptions had already been exercised in the matter he would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing when the certainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected after all
she suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than herself and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with dignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism
where could she find such a friend
nowhere in the house
she was by far the coolest of the women under her roof
patience and suspension of judgement for a few hours were what she wanted to learn and there was nobody to teach her
might she but go to gabriel oak
 but that could not be
what a way oak had she thought of enduring things
boldwood who seemed so much deeper and higher and stronger in feeling than gabriel had not yet learnt any more than she herself the simple lesson which oak showed a mastery of by every turn and look he gave  that among the multitude of interests by which he was surrounded those which affected his personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and important in his eyes
oak meditatively looked upon the horizon of circumstances without any special regard to his own standpoint in the midst
that was how she would wish to be
but then oak was not racked by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his bosom as she was at this moment
oak knew all about fanny that he wished to know  she felt convinced of that
if she were to go to him now at once and say no more than these few wordswhat is the truth of the story
he would feel bound in honour to tell her
it would be an inexpressible relief
no further speech would need to be uttered
he knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in her would alarm him
she flung a cloak round her went to the door and opened it
every blade every twig was still
the air was yet thick with moisture though somewhat less dense than during the afternoon and a steady smack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost musical in its soothing regularity
lt seemed better to be out of the house than within it and bathsheba closed the door and walked slowly down the lane till she came opposite to gabriel's cottage where he now lived alone having left coggan's house through being pinched for room
there was a light in one window only' and that was downstairs
the shutters were not closed nor was any blind or curtain drawn over the window neither robbery nor observation being a contingency which could do much injury to the occupant of the domicile
yes it was gabriel himself who was sitting up  he was reading from her standingplace in the road she could see him plainly sitting quite still his light curly head upon his hand and only occasionally looking up to snuff the candle which stood beside him
at length he looked at the clock seemed surprised at the lateness of the hour closed his book and arose
he was going to bed she knew and if she tapped it must be done at once
alas for her resolve
she felt she could not do it not for worlds now could she give a hint about her misery to him much less ask him plainly for information on the cause of fanny's death
she must suspect and guess and chafe and bear it all alone
like a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank as if lulled and fascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from that little dwelling and was so sadly lacking in her own
gabriel appeared in an upper room placed his light in the windowbench and then  knelt down to pray
the contrast of the picture with her rebellious and agitated existence at this same time was too much for her to bear to look upon longer
it was not for her to make a truce with trouble by any such means
she must tread her giddy distracting measure to its last note as she had begun it
with a swollen heart she went again up the lane and entered her own door
more fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings which oak's example had raised in her she paused in the hall looking at the door of the room wherein fanny lay
she locked her fingers threw back her head and strained her hot hands rigidly across her forehead saying with a hysterical sob would to god you would speak and tell me your secret fanny 
 
o i hope hope it is not true that there are two of you

if i could only look in upon you for one little minute i should know all
a few moments passed and she added slowly and i will bathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood which carried her through the actions following this murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her life
she went to the lumbercloset for a screwdriver
at the end of a short though undefined time she found herself in the small room quivering with emotion a mist before her eyes and an excruciating pulsation in her brain standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed within  it was best to know the worst and i know it now
she was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series of actions done as by one in an extravagant dream of following that idea as to method which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring obviousness by gliding to the top of the stairs assuring herself by listening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep gliding down again turning the handle of the door within which the young girl lay and deliberately setting herself to do what if she had antici pated any such undertaking at night and alone would have horrified her but which when done was not so dreadful as was the conclusive proof of her husband's conduct which came with knowing beyond doubt the last chapter of fanny's story
bathsheba's head sank upon her bosom and the breath which had been bated in suspense curiosity and interest was exhaled now in the form of a whispered wail ohhh
she said and the silent room added length to her moan
her tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the coffin tears of a complicated origin of a nature inde scribable almost indefinable except as other than those of simple sorrow
assuredly their wonted fires must have lived in fanny's ashes when events were so shaped as to chariot her hither in this natural unobtrusive yet effectual manner
the one feat alone  that of dying  by which a mean condition could be resolved into a grand one fanny had achieved
and to that had destiny subjoined this rencounter tonight which had in bathsheba's wild imagining turned her companion's failure to success her humiliation to triumph her luck lessness to ascendency et had thrown over herself a garish light of mockery and set upon all things about her an ironical smile
fanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of hers and there was no longer much room for doubt as to the origin of the curl owned by troy
in bath sheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance expressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain she was retaliating for her pain with all the merciless rigour of the mosaic law burning for burning wound for wound strife for strife
bathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from her position by immediate death which thought she though it was an inconvenient and awful way had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not be overpassed whilst the shames of life were measureless
yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out tamely copying her rival's method without the reasons which had glorified it in her rival's case
she glided rapidly up and down the room as was mostly her habit hen excited her hands hanging clasped in front of her as she thought and in part expressed in broken words o i hate her yet i don't mean that i hate her for it is grievous and wicked and yet i hate her a little
yes my flesh insists upon hating her whether my spirit is willing or no
if she had only lived i could ave been angry and cruel towards her with some justifi cation but to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman recoils upon myself
o god have mercy
i am miserable at all this
bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her own state of mind that she looked around for some sort of refuge from herself
the vision of oak kneeling down that night recurred to her and with the imitative instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea resolved to kneel and if possible pray
gabriel had prayed so would she
she knelt beside the coffin covered her face with her hands and for a time the room was silent as a tomb
whether from a purely mechanical or from any other cause when bathsheba arose it was with a quieted spirit and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had seized upon her just before
in her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the window and began laying them around the dead girl's head
bathsheba knew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by giving them flowers
she knew not how long she remained engaged thus
she forgot time life where she was what she was doing
a slamming together of the coachhouse doors in the yard brought her to her self again
an instant after the front door opened and closed steps crossed the hall and her husband appeared at the entrance to the room looking in upon her
he beheld it all by degrees stared in stupefaction at the scene as if he thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation
bathsheba pallid as a corpse on end gazed back at him in the same wild way
so little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction that at this moment as he stood with the door in his hand troy never once thought of fanny in connection with what he saw
his first confused idea was that somebody in the house had died
well  what
said troy blankly
i must go
i must go
said bathsheba to herself more than to him
she came with a dilated eye towards the door to push past him
what's the matter in god's name
who's dead
said troy
i cannot say let me go out
i want air
she continued
but no stay i insist
he seized her hand and then volition seemed to leave her and she went off into a state of passivity
he still holding her came up the room and thus hand in hand troy and bathsheba approached the coffin's side
the candle was standing on a bureau close by them and the light slanted down distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother and babe
troy looked in dropped his wife's hand knowledge of it all came over him in a lurid sheen and he stood still
so still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no motive power whatever
the clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one another produced a neutrality and there was motion in none
do you know her
said bathsheba in a small enclosed echo as from the interior of a cell
i do
said troy
is it she
it is
he had originally stood perfectly erect
and now in the wellnigh congealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient movement as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a while
he was gradually sinking forwards
the lines of his features softened and dismay modulated to illimitable sadness
bathsheba was regarding him from the other side still with parted lips and distracted eyes
capacity for intense feeling is proportionate to the general intensity of the nature and perhaps in all fanny's sufferings much greater relatively to her strength there never was a time she suffered in an absolute sense what bathsheba suffered now
what troy did was to sink upon  his knees with an indefinable union of remorse and reverence upon his face and bending over fanny robin gently kissed her as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid awakening it
at the sight and sound of that to her unendurable act bathsheba sprang towards him
all the strong feelings which had been scattered over her existence since she knew what feeling was seemed gathered together into one pulsation now
the revulsion from her indignant mood a little earlier when she had meditated upon compromised honour forestalment eclipse in maternity by another was violent and entire
all that was forgotten in the simple and still strong attachment of wife to husband
she had sighed for her selfcompleteness then and now she cried aloud against the severance of the union she had deplored
she flung her arms round troy's neck exclaiming wildly from the deepest deep of her heart  don't  don't kiss them
o frank i cant bear iti can't
i love you better than she did kiss me too frank  kiss me
you will frank kiss me too
there was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a woman of bathsheba's calibre and independence that troy loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck looked at her in bewilderment
it was such and unex pected revelation of all women being alike at heart even those so different in their accessories as fanny and this one beside him that troy could hardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife bathsheba
fanny's own spirit seemed to be animating her frame
but this was the mood of a few instants only
when the momentary i will not kiss you
he said pushing her away
had the wife now but gone no further
yet perhaps
under the harrowing circumstances to speak out was the one wrong act which can be better under stood if not forgiven in her than the right and politic one her rival being now but a corpse
all the feeling she had been betrayed into showing she drew back to herself again by a strenuous effort of selfcommand
what have you to say as your reason
she asked her bitter voice being strangely low  quite that of another woman now
i have to say that i have been a bad blackhearted man
he answered
less than she
ah
don't taunt me madam
this woman is more to me dead as she is than ever you were or are or can be
if satan had not tempted me with that face of yours and those cursed coquetries i should have he turned to fanny then
but never mind darling wife
at these words there arose from bathsheba's lips a long low cry of measureless despair and indignation such a wail of anguish as had never before been heard within those oldinhabited walls
it was the product of her union with troy
if she's    that  what  am i
she added as a continuation of the same cry and sobbing pitifully and the rarity with her of such abandonment only made the condition more dire
you are nothing to me    nothing
said troy heartlessly
a ceremony before a priest doesn't make a marriage
i am not morally yours
a vehement impulse to flee from him to run from this place hide and escape his words at any price not stopping short of death itself mastered bathsheba now
she waited not an instant but turned to the door and ran out
chapter xliv    under a tree  reaction   bathsheba went along the dark road neither know ing nor caring about the direction or issue of her flight
the first time that she definitely noticed her position was when she reached a gate leading into a thicket over hung by some large oak and beech trees
on looking into the place it occurred to her that she had seen it by daylight on some previous occasion and that what appeared like an impassable thicket was in reality a brake of fern now withering fast
she could think of nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go in here and hide and entering she lighted on a spot sheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk where she sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and stems
she mechanically pulled some armfuls round her to keep off the breezes and closed her eyes
whether she slept or not that night bathsheba was not clearly aware
but it was with a freshened exist ence and a cooler brain that a long time afterwards she became conscious of some interesting proceedings which were going on in the trees above her head and around
a coarsethroated chatter was the first sound
it was a sparrow just waking
next  cheeweezeweezeweeze
from another retreat
it was a finch
third  tinktinktinktinkachink
from the hedge it was a robin
chuckchuckchuck
overhead
a squirrel
then from the road with my ratata and my rumtumtum
it was a ploughboy
presently he came opposite and she believed from his voice that he was one of the boys on her own farm
he was followed by a shambling tramp of heavy feet and looking through the ferns bathsheba could just discern in the wan light of daybreak a team of her own horses
they stopped to drink at a pond on the other side of the way'
she watched them flouncing into the pool drinking tossing up their heads drinking again the water dribbling from their lips in silver threads
there was another flounce and they came out of the pond and turned back again towards the farm
she looked further around
day was just dawning and beside its cool air and colours her heated actions and resolves of the night stood out in lurid contrast
she perceived that in her lap and clinging to her hair were red and yellow leaves which had come down from the tree and settled silently upon her during her partial sleep
bathsheba shook her dress to get rid of them when multitudes of the same family lying round about her rose and fluttered away in the breeze thus created like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing
there was an opening towards the east and the glow from the as yet unrisen sun attracted her eyes thither
from her feet and between the beautiful yellowing ferns with their feathery arms the ground sloped downwards to a hollow in which was a species of swamp dotted with fungi
a morning mist hung over it now  a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil full of light from the sun yet semiopaque  the hedge behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy luminousness
up the sides of this depression grew sheaves of the common rush and here and there a peculiar species of flag the blades of which glistened in the emerging sun like scythes
but the general aspect of the swamp was malignant
from its moist and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the essences of evil things in the earth and in the waters under the earth
the fungi grew in all manner of positions from rotting leaves and tree stumps some exhibiting to her listless gaze their clammy tops others their oozing gills
some were marked with great splotches red as arterial blood others were saffron yellow and others tall and attenuated with stems like macaroni
some were leathery and of richest browns
the hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and great in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort and health and bathsheba arose with a tremor at the thought of having passed the night on the brink of so dismal a place
there were now other footsteps to be heard along the road
bathsheba's nerves were still unstrung she crouched down out of sight again and the pedes trian came into view
he was a schoolboy with a bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner and a hook in his hand
he paused by the gate and without looking up continued murmuring words in tones quite loud enough to reach her ears
o lord o lord o lord o lord o lord  that i know out o' book
give us give us give us give us give us   that i know
grace that grace that grace that grace that   that i know
other words followed to the same effect
the boy was of the dunce class apparently the book was a psalter and this was his way of learning the collect
in the worst attacks of trouble there appears to be always a super ficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged and open to the notice of trifles and bathsheba was faintly amused at the boy's method till he too passed on
by this time stupor had given place to anxiety and anxiety began to make room for hunger and thirst
a form now appeared upon the rise on the other side of the swamp halfhidden by the mist and came towards bathsheba
the woman  for it was a woman   approached with her face askance as if looking earnestly on all sides of her
when she got a little further round to the left and drew nearer bathsheba could see the newcomer's profile against the sunny sky' and knew the wavy sweep from forehead to chin with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere about it to be the familiar contour of liddy smallbury
bathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was not altogether deserted and she jumped up
o liddy
she said or attempted to say but the words had only been framed by her lips there came no sound
she had lost her voice by exposure to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night
o ma'am
i am so glad i have found you
said the girl as soon as she saw bathsheba
you can't come across
bathsheba said in a whisper which she vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to reach liddy's ears
liddy not knowing this stepped down upon the swamp saying as she did so it will bear me up i think
bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of liddy crossing the swamp to her there in the morning light
iridescent bubbles of dank subter ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the waiting maid's feet as she trod hissing as they burst and expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above
liddy did not sink as bathsheba had anticipated
she landed safely on the other side and looked up at the beautiful though pale and weary face of her young mistress
poor thing
said liddy with tears in her eyes do hearten yourself up a little ma'am
however did     i can't speak above a whisper  my voice is gone for the present
said bathsheba hurriedly
i suppose the damp air from that hollow has taken it away liddy don't question me mind
who sent you  anybody
nobody
i thought when i found you were not at home that something cruel had happened
i fancy i heard his voice late last night and so knowing something was wrong     is he at home
no he left just before i came out
is fanny taken away
not yet
she will soon be  at nine o'clock
we won't go home at present then
suppose we walk about in this wood
liddy without exactly understanding everything or anything in this episode assented and they walked together further among the trees
but you had better come in ma'am and have something to eat
you will die of a chill
i shall not come indoors yet  perhaps never
shall i get you something to eat and something else to put over your head besides that little shawl
if you will liddy
liddy vanished and at the end of twenty minutes returned with a cloak hat some slices of bread and butter a teacup and some hot tea in a little china jug is fanny gone
said bathsheba
no
said her companion pouring out the tea
bathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank sparingly
her voice was then a little clearer and trifling colour returned to her face
now we'll walk about again
she said
they wandered about the wood for nearly two hours bathsheba replying in monosyllables to liddy's prattle for her mind ran on one subject and one only
she interrupted with  l wonder if fanny is gone by this time
i will go and see
she came back with the information that the men were just taking away the corpse that bathsheba had been inquired for that she had replied to the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be seen
then they think i am in my bedroom
yes
liddy then ventured to add you said when i first found you that you might never go home again  you didn't mean it ma'am
no i've altered my mind
it is only women with no pride in them who run away from their husbands
there is one position worse than that of being found dead in your husband's house from his ill usage and that is to be found alive through having gone away to the house of somebody else
i've thought of it all this morning and i've chosen my course
a runaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody a burden to herself and a byword  all of which make up a heap of misery greater than any that comes by staying at home  though this may include the trifling items of insult beating and starvation
liddy if ever you marry  god forbid that you ever should
 you'll find yourself in a fearful situation but mind this don't you flinch
stand your ground and be cut to pieces
that's what i'm going to do
o mistress don't talk so
said liddytaking her hand but i knew you had too much sense to bide away
may i ask what dreadful thing it is that has happened between you and him
you may ask but i may not tell
in about ten minutes they returned to the house by a circuitous route entering at the rear
bathsheba glided up the back stairs to a disused attic and her companion followed
liddy
she said with a lighter heart for youth and hope had begun to reassert themselves you are to be my confidante for the present  somebody must be  and i choose you
well i shall take up my abode here for a while
will you get a fire lighted put down a piece of carpet and help me to make the place comfortable
afterwards i want you and maryann to bring up that little stump bedstead in the small room and the be belonging to it and a table and some other things
what shall i do to pass the heavy time away
hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing
said liddy
o no no
i hate needleworki always did
knitting
and that too
you might finish your sampler
only the carna tions and peacocks want filling in and then it could be framed and glazed and hung beside your aunt ma'am
samplers are out of date  horribly countrified
no liddy i'll read
bring up some books  not new ones
i haven't heart to read anything new
some of your uncle's old ones ma'am
yes
some of those we stowed away in boxes
a faint gleam of humour passed over her face as she said bring beaumont and fletcher's maid's tragedy and the mourning bride and let me see  night thoughts and the vanity of human wishes
and that story of the black man who murdered his wife desdemona
it is a nice dismal one that would suit you excellent just now
now liddy you've been looking into my book without telling me and i said you were not to
how do you know it would suit me
it wouldn't suit me a all
but if the others do     no they don't and i won't read dismal books
why should i read dismal books indeed
bring me love in a village and maid of the mill and doctor syntax and some volumes of the spectator
all that day bathsheba and liddy lived in the attic in a state of barricade a precaution which proved to be needless as against troy for he did not appear in the neighbourhood or trouble them at all
bathsheba sat at the window till sunset sometimes attempting to read at other times watching every movement outside without much purpose and listening without much interest to every sound
the sun went down almost bloodred that night and a livid cloud received its rays in the east
up against this dark background the west front of the church tower  the only part of the edifice visible from the farmhouse windows  rose distinct and lustrous the vane upon the summit bristling with rays
hereabouts at six o'clock the young men of the village gathered as was their custom for a game of prisoners' base
the spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from time immemorial the old stocks conveniently forming a base facing the boundary of the churchyard in front of which the ground was trodden hard and bare as a pavement by the players
she could see the brown and black heads of the young lads darting about right and left their white shirtsleeves gleaming in the sun whilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter varied the stillness of the evening air
they continued playing for a quarter of an hour or so when the game concluded abruptly and the players leapt over the wall and vanished round to the other side behind a yewtree which was also half behind a beech now spreading in one mass of golden foliage on which the branches traced black lines
why did the baseplayers finish their game so suddenly
bathsheba inquired the next time that liddy entered the room
i think 'twas because two men came just then from casterbridge and began putting up grand carved tombstone
said liddy
the lads went to see whose it was
do you know
bathsheba asked
i don't
said liddy
chapter xlv    troy's romanticism   when troy's wife had left the house at the previous midnight his first act was to cover the dead from sight
this done he ascended the stairs and throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was he waited miser ably for the morning
fate had dealt grimly with him through the last four andtwenty hours
his day had been spent in a way which varied very materially from his intentions regard ing it
there is always an inertia to be overcome in striking out a new line of conduct  not more in our selves it seems than in circumscribing events which appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in the way of amelioration
twenty pounds having been secured from bathsheba he had managed to add to the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account which had been seven pounds ten
with this money twentyseven pounds ten in all he had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his appointment with fanny robin
on reaching casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn and at five minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end of the town and sat himself upon the parapet
the clocks struck the hour and no fanny appeared
in fact at that moment she was being robed in her graveclothes by two attendants at the union poorhouse  the first and last tiringwomen the gentle creature had ever been honoured with
the quarter went the half hour
a rush of recollection came upon troy as he waited this was the second time she had broken a serious engagement with him in anger he vowed it should be the last and at eleven o'clock when he had lingered and watched the stone of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon their face and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they oppressed him he jumped from his seat went to the inn for his gig and in a bitter mood of indifference con cerning the past and recklessness about the future drove on to budmouth races
he reached the racecourse at two o'clock and re mained either there or in the town till nine but fanny's image as it had appeared to him in the sombre shadows of that saturday evening returned to his mind backed up by bathsheba's reproaches
he vowed he would not bet and he kept his vow for on leaving the town at nine o'clock in the evening he had diminish his cash only to the extent of a few shillings
he trotted slowly homeward and it was now that was struck for the first time with a thought that fanny had been really prevented by illness from keeping her promise
this time she could have made no mistake he regretted that he had not remained in casterbridge and made inquiries
reaching home he quietly un harnessed the horse and came indoors as we have seen to the fearful shock that awaited him
as soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects troy arose from the coverlet of the bed and in a mood of absolute indifference to bathsheba's whereabouts a almost oblivious of her existence he stalked downstairs and left the house by the back door
his walk was towards the churchyard entering which he searched around till he found a newly dug unoccupied grave  the grave dug the day before for fanny
the position of this having been marked he hastened on to caster bridge only pausing whereon he had last seen fanny alive
reaching the town troy descended into a side street and entered a pair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words lester stone and marble mason
within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons who had not yet died
troy was so unlike himself now in look word and deed that the want of likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness
his method of engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an absolutely unpractised man
he could not bring him self to consider calculate or economize
he waywardly wished for something and he set about obtaining it like a child in a nursery
'i want a good tomb
he said to the man who stood in a little office within the yard
i want as good a one as you can give me for twenty seven pounds it was all the money he possessed
that sum to include everything
everything
cutting the name carriage to weather bury and erection
and i want it now at once 
we could not get anything special worked this week
if you would like one of these in stock it could be got ready immediately
very well
said troy impatiently
let's see what you have
the best i have in stock is this one said the stone cutter going into a shed
here's a marble headstone beautifully crocketed with medallions beneath of typical subjects here's the footstone after the same pattern and here's the coping to enclose the grave
the slabs are the best of their kind and i can warrant them well i could add the name and put it up at visitor who wore not a shred of mourning
troy then settled the account and went away
in the afternoon almost done
he waited in the yard till the tomb was way to weatherbury giving directions to the two men the grave of the person named in the inscription
bridge
he carried rather a heavy basket upon his occasionally at bridges and gates whereon he deposited returning in the darkness the men and the waggon the work was done and on being assured that it was troy entered weatherbury churchyard about ten had marked the vacant grave early in the morning
it extent from the view of passers along the road  a spot and bushes of alder but now it was cleared and made the ground elsewhere
here now stood the tomb as the men had stated snow white and shapely in the gloom consisting of head and footstone and enclosing border of marblework uniting them
in the midst was mould suitable for plants
troy deposited his basket beside the tomb and vanished for a few minutes
when he returned he carried a spade and a lantern the light of which he directed for a few moments upon the marble whilst he read the inscription
he hung his lantern on the lowest bough of the yewtree and took from his basket flower roots of several varieties
there were bundles of snow drop hyacinth and crocus bulbs violets and double daisies which were to bloom in early spring and of carnations pinks picotees lilies of the valley forgetme not summer'sfarewell meadowsaffron and others for the later seasons of the year
troy laid these out upon the grass and with an im passive face set to work to plant them
the snowdrops were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping the remainder within the enclosure of the grave
the crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows some of the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet the lilies and forgetmenots over her heart
the remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these
troy in his prostration at this time had no percep tion that in the futility of these romantic doings dictated by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference there was any element of absurdity
deriving his idiosyn crasies from both sides of the channel he showed at such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the englishman together with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on mawkishness characteristic of the french
lt was a cloudy muggy and very dark night and the rays from troy's lantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating power flickering as it seemed up to the black ceiling of cloud above
he felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand and presently one came and entered one of the holes of the lantern whereupon the candle sputtered and went out troy was weary and it being now not far from midnight and the rain threatening to increase he resolved to leave the finishing touches of his labour until the day should break
he groped along the wall and over the graves in the dark till he found himself round at the north side
here he entered the porch and reclining upon the bench within fell asleep
chapter xlvi    the gurgoyle  its doings   the tower of weatherbury church was a square erection of fourteenthcentury date having two stone gurgoyles on each of the four faces of its parapet
of these eight carved protuberances only two at this time continued to serve the purpose of their erection  that of spouting the water from the lead roof within
one mouth in each front had been closed by bygone church wardens as superfluous and two others were broken away and choked  a matter not of much consequence to the wellbeing of the tower for the two mouths which still remained open and active were gaping enough to do all the work
it has been sometimes argued that there is no truer criterion of the vitality of any given artperiod than the power of the masterspirits of that time in grotesque and certainly in the instance of gothic art there is no disputing the proposition
weatherbury tower was a somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches and the gurgoyles which are the necessary correlatives of a parapet were exceptionally prominent  of the boldest cut that the hand could shape and of the most original design that a human brain could conceive
there was so to speak that symmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic of british than of continental grotesques of the period
all the eight were different from each other
a beholder was con vinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north side until he went round to the south
of the two on this latter face only that at the southeastern corner concerns the story
it was too human to be called like a dragon too impish to be like a man too animal to be like a fiend and not enough like a bird to be called a griffin
this horrible stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled hide it had short erect ears eyes starting from their sockets and its fingers and hands were seizing the corners of its mouth which they thus seemed to pull open to give free passage to the water it vomited
the lower row of teeth was quite washed away though the upper still remained
here and thus jutting a couple of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a support the creature had for four hundred years laughed at the surrounding landscape voicelessly in dry weather and in wet with a gurgling and snorting sound
troy slept on in the porch and the rain increased outside
presently the gurgoyle spat
in due time a small stream began to trickle through the seventy feet of aerial space between its mouth and the ground which the waterdrops smote like duckshot in their accelerated velocity
the stream thickened in substance and in creased in power gradually spouting further and yet further from the side of the tower
when the rain fell in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed downward in volumes
we follow its course to the ground at this point of time
the end of the liquid parabola has come forward from the wall has advanced over the plinth mouldings over a heap of stones over the marble border into the midst of fanny robin's grave
the force of the stream had until very lately been received upon some loose stones spread thereabout which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset
these during the summer had been cleared from the ground and there was now nothing to resist the down fall but the bare earth
for several years the stream had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing on this night and such a contingency had been over looked
sometimes this obscure corner received no inhabitant for the space of two or three years and then it was usually but a pauper a poacher or other sinner of undignified sins
the persistent torrent from the gurgoyle's jaws directed all its vengeance into the grave
the rich tawny mould was stirred into motion and boiled like chocolate
the water accumulated and washed deeper down and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into the night as the head and chief among other noises of the kind created by the deluging rain
the flowers so carefully planted by fanny's repentant lover began to move and writhe in their bed
the winterviolets turned slowly upside down and became a mere mat of mud
soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron
plants of the tufted species were loosened rose to the surface and floated of
troy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day
not having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff his feet tender and his head heavy
he remembered his position arose shivered took the spade and again went out
the rain had quite ceased and the sun was shining through the green brown and yellow leaves now sparkling and varnished by the raindrops to the bright ness of similar effects in the landscapes of ruysdael and hobbema and full of all those infinite beauties that arise from the union of water and colour with high lights
the air was rendered so transparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the middle distance were as rich as those near at hand and the remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower ap peared in the same plane as the tower itself
he entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower
the path instead of being stony as it had been the night before was browned over with a thin coating of mud
at one place in the path he saw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle of tendons
he picked it up  surely it could not be one of the primroses he had planted
he saw a bulb another and another as he advanced
beyond doubt they were the crocuses
with a face of perplexed dismay troy turned the corner and then beheld the wreck the stream had made
the pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground and in its place was a hollow
the disturbed earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen and it spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains
nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the ground and they lay roots upwards on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream
troy's brow became heavily contracted
he set his teeth closely and his compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain
this singular accident by a strange confluence of emotions in him was felt as the sharpest sting of all
troy's face was very expressive and any observer who had seen him now would hardly have believed him to be a man who had laughed and sung and poured lovetrifles into a woman's ear
to curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse but even that lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid misery which wrung him
the sight coming as it did superimposed upon the other dark scenery of the previous days formed a sort of climax to the whole panorama and it was more than he could endure
sanguine by nature troy had a power of eluding grief by simply adjourning it
he could put off the consideration of any particular spectre till the matter had become old and softened by time
the planting of flowers on fanny's grave had been perhaps but a species of elusion of the primary grief and now it was as if his intention had been known and circumvented
almost for the first time in his life troy as he stood by this dismantled grave wished himself another man
lt is seldom that a person with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his life being his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him in every particular
troy had felt in his transient way hundreds of times that he could not envy other people their condition because the possession of that condition would have necessitated a different personality when he desired no other than his own
he had not minded the peculiarities of his birth the vicissitudes of his life the meteorlike uncertainty of all that related to him because these appertained to the hero of his story without whom there would have been no story at all for him and it seemed to be only in the nature of things that matters would right themselves at some proper date and wind up well
this very morning the illusion completed its disappearance and as it were all of a sudden troy hated himself
the suddenness was probably more apparent than real
a coral reef which just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon than if it had never been begun and the mere finishing stroke is what often appears to create an event which has long been potentially an accomplished thing
he stood and mediated  a miserable man
whither should he go 
he that is accursed let him be accursed still
was the pitiless anathema written in this spoliated effort of his newborn solicitousness
a man who has spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction has not much spirit left for reversing his course
troy had since yesterday faintly reversed his but the merest opposition had disheartened him
to turn about would have been hard enough under the greatest providential encouragement but to find that providence far from helping him into a new course or showing any wish that he might adopt one actually jeered his first trembling and critical attempt in that kind was more than nature could bear
he slowly withdrew from the grave
he did not attempt to fill up the hole replace the flowers or do anything at all
he simply threw up his cards and forswore his game for that time and always
going out of the churchyard silently and unobserved  none of the villagers having yet risen  he passed down some fields at the back and emerged just as secretly upon the high road
shortly afterwards he had gone from the village
meanwhile bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic
the door was kept locked except during the entries and exits of liddy for whom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room
the light of troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten o'clock by the maidservant who casually glanced from the window in that direction whilst taking her supper and she called bathsheba's attention to it
they looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time until liddy was sent to bed
bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night
when her attendant was unconscious and softly breath ing in the next room the mistress of the house was still looking out of the window at the faint gleam spreading from among the trees  not in a steady shine but blinking like a revolving coastlight though this appearance failed to suggest to her that a person was passing and repassing in front of it
bathsheba sat here till it began to rain and the light vanished when she withdrew to lie restlessly in her bed and reenact in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight
almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again and opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning air the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night rain each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awaken ing sky
from the trees came the sound of steady dripping upon the drifted leaves under them and from the direction of the church she could hear another noise   peculiar and not intermittent like the rest the purl of water falling into a pool
liddy knocked at eight o'clock and bathsheba un locked the door
what a heavy rain we've had in the night ma'am
said liddy when her inquiries about breakfast had been made
yes very heavy
did you hear the strange noise from the church yard
i heard one strange noise
i've been thinking it must have been the water from the tower spouts
well that's what the shepherd was saying ma'am
he's now gone on to see
oh
gabriel has been here this morning
only just looked in in passing  quite in his old way which i thought he had left off lately
but the tower spouts used to spatter on the stones and we are puzzled for this was like the boiling of a pot
not being able to read think or work bathsheba asked liddy to stay and breakfast with her
the tongue of the more childish woman still ran upon recent events
are you going across to the church ma'am
she asked
not that i know of
said bathsheba
i thought you might like to go and see where they have put fanny
the trees hide the place from your window
bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband
has mr
troy been in tonight
she said no ma'am i think he's gone to budmouth
budmouth
the sound of the word carried with it a much diminished perspective of him and his deeds there were thirteen miles interval betwixt them now
she hated questioning liddy about her husband's movements and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided doing so but now all the house knew that there had been some dreadful disagreement between them and it was futile to attempt disguise
bathsheba had reached a stage at which people cease to have any appreciative regard for public opinion
what makes you think he has gone there
she said
laban tall saw him on the budmouth road this morning before breakfast
bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward heaviness of the past twentyfour hours which had quenched the vitality of youth in her without sub stituting the philosophy of maturer years and the resolved to go out and walk a little way
so when breakfast was over she put on her bonnet and took a direction towards the church
it was nine o'clock and the men having returned to work again from their first meal she was not likely to meet many of them in the road
knowing that fanny had been laid in the reprobates' quarter of the graveyard called in the parish behind church
which was invisible from the road it was impossible to resist the impulse to enter and look upon a spot which from nameless feelings she at the same time dreaded to see
she had been unable to overcome an impression that some connection existed between her rival and the light through the trees
bathsheba skirted the buttress and beheld the hole and the tomb its delicately veined surface splashed and stained just as troy had seen it and left it two hours earlier
on the other side of the scene stood gabriel
his eyes too were fixed on the tomb and her arrival having been noiseless she had not as yet attracted his attention
bathsheba did not at once perceive that the grand tomb and the disturbed grave were fanny's and she looked on both sides and around for some humbler mound earthed up and clodded in the usual way
then her eye followed oak's and she read the words with which the inscription opened   erected by francis troy in beloved memory of fanny robin
oak saw her and his first act was to gaze inquiringly and learn how she received this knowledge of the authorship of the work which to himself had caused considerable astonishment
but such discoveries did not much affect her now
emotional convulsions seemed to have become the commonplaces of her history and she bade him good morning and asked him to fill in the hole with the spade which was standing by
whilst oak was doing as she desired bathsheba collected the flowers and began planting them with that sympathetic manipulation of roots and leaves which is so conspicuous in a woman's gardening and which flowers seem to understand and thrive upon
she requested oak to get the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the mouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon them that by this means the stream might be directed sideways and a repetition of the accident prevented
finally with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness upon her instead of love she wiped the mud spots from the tomb as if she rather liked its words than otherwise     chapter xlvii    adventures by the shore   troy wandered along towards the south
a composite feeling made up of disgust with the to him humdrum tediousness of a farmer's life gloomily images of her who lay in the churchyard remorse and a general averseness to his wife's society impelled him to seek a home in any place on earth save weatherbury
the sad accessories of fanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible and made life in bathsheba's house intolerable
at three in the afternoon he found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the shore and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder scenery of the coast
up the hill stretched a road nearly straight and perfectly white the two sides approaching each other in a gradual taper till they met the sky at the top about two miles off
through out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression greater than any he had experienced for many a day and year before
the air was warm and muggy and the top seemed to recede as he approached
at last he reached the summit and a wide and novel prospect burst upon him with an effect almost like that of the pacific upon balboa's gaze
the broad steely sea marked only by faint lines which had a semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep enough to disturb its general evenness stretched the whole width of his front and round to the right where near the town and port of budmouth the sun bristled down upon it and banished all colour to substitute in its place a clear oily polish
nothing moved in sky land or sea except a frill of milkwhite foam along the nearer angles of the shore shreds of which licked the contiguous stones like tongues
he descended and came to a small basin of sea enclosed by the cliffs
troy's nature freshened within him he thought he would rest and bathe here before going farther
he undressed and plunged in
inside the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer being smooth as a pond and to get a little of the ocean swell troy presently swam between the two projecting spurs of rock which formed the pillars of hercules to this miniature mediterranean
unfortunately for troy a current unknown to him existed outside which un important to craft of any burden was awkward for a swimmer who might be taken in it unawares
troy found himself carried to the left and then round in a swoop out to sea
he now recollected the place and its sinister character
many bathers had there prayed for a dry death from time to time and like gonzalo also had been unanswered and troy began to deem it possible that he might be added to their number
not a boat of any kind was at present within sight but far in the distance budmouth lay upon the sea as it were quietly regarding his efforts and beside the town the harbour showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and spars
after wellnigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to the mouth of the cove in his weakness swimming several inches deeper than was his wont keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils turning upon his back a dozen times over swimming en papillon and so on troy resolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight incline and so endeavour to reach the shore at any point merely giving himself a gentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direc tion of the tide
this necessarily a slow process he found to be not altogether so difficult and though there was no choice of a landingplace  the objects on shore passing by him in a sad and slow procession  he per ceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land yet further to the right now well defined against the sunny portion of the horizon
while the swimmer's eye's were fixed upon the spit as his only means of salvation on this side of the unknown a moving object broke the outline of the extremity and immediately a ship's boat appeared manned with several sailor lads her bows towards the sea
all troy's vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a little further
swimming with his right arm he held up his left to hail them splashing upon the waves and shouting with all his might
from the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly visible upon the now deephued bosom of the sea to the east of the boat and the men saw him at once
backing their oars and putting the boat about they pulled towards him with a will and in five or six minutes from the time of his first halloo two of the sailors hauled him in over the stern
they formed part of a brig's crew and had come ashore for sand
lending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a slight protection against late they made again towards the roadstead where their and now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery levels in front and at no great distance from them where the shoreline curved round and formed a long riband of shade upon the horizon a series of points of yellow light began to start into existence denoting the spot to be the site of budmouth where the lamps were being lighted along the parade
the cluck of their oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the sea and as they laboured amid the thickening shades the lamplights grew larger each appearing to send a flaming sword deep down into the waves before it until there arose among other dim shapes of the kind the form of the vessel for which they were bound
chapter xlviii    doubts arise  doubts linger   bathsheba underwent the enlargement of her husband's absence from hours to days with a slight feeling of surprise and a slight feeling of relief yet neither sensation rose at any time far above the level commonly designated as indifference
she belonged to him  the certainties of that position were so well defined and the reasonable probabilities of its issue so bounded that she could not speculate on contingencies
taking no further interest in herself as a splendid woman she acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in contem plating her probable fate as a singular wretch for bath sheba drew herself and her future in colours that no reality could exceed for darkness
her original vigorous pride of youth had sickened and with it had declined all her anxieties about coming years since anxiety recognizes a better and a worse alternative and bath sheba had made up her mind that alternatives on any noteworthy scale had ceased for her
soon or later  and that not very late  her husband would be home again
and then the days of their tenancy of the upper farm would be numbered
there had origin ally been shown by the agent to the estate some distrust of bathsheba's tenure as james everdene's successor on the score of her sex and her youth and her beauty but the peculiar nature of her uncle's will his own frequent testimony before his death to her cleverness in such a pursuit and her vigorous marshalling of the numerous flocks and herds which came suddenly into her hands before negotiations were concluded had won confidence in her powers and no further objections had been raised
she had latterly been in great doubt as to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon her position but no notice had been taken as yet of her change of name and only one point was clear  that in the event of her own or her husband's inability to meet the agent at the forthcoming january rentday very little consideration would be shown and for that matter very little would be deserved
once out of the farm the approach of poverty would be sure
hence bathsheba lived in a perception that her purposes were broken of
she was not a woman who could hope on without good materials for the process differing thus from the less farsighted and energetic though more petted ones of the sex with whom hope goes on as a sort of clockwork which the merest food and shelter are sufficient to wind up and perceiving clearly that her mistake had been a fatal one she accepted her position and waited coldly for the end
the first saturday after troy's departure she went to casterbridge alone a journey she had not before taken since her marriage
on this saturday bathsheba was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of rural businessmen gathered as usual in front of the market house who were as usual gazed upon by the burghers with feelings that those healthy lives were dearly paid for by exclusion from possible aldermanship when a man who had apparently been following her said some words to another on her left hand
bathsheba's ears were keen as those of any wild animal and she dis tinctly heard what the speaker said though her back was towards him i am looking for mrs
troy
is that she there
yes that's the young lady i believe
said the the person addressed
i have some awkward news to break to her
her husband is drowned
as if endowed with the spirit of prophecy bathsheba gasped out no it is not true it cannot be true
then she said and heard no more
the ice of self command which had latterly gathered over her was broken and the currents burst forth again and over whelmed her
a darkness came into her eyes and she fell
but not to the ground
a gloomy man who had been observing her from under the portico of the old cornexchange when she passed through the group without stepped quickly to her side at the moment of her exclamation and caught her in his arms as she sank down
what is it
said boldwood looking up at the bringer of the big news as he supported her
her husband was drowned this week while bathing in lulwind cove
a coastguardsman found his clothes and brought them into budmouth yesterday
thereupon a strange fire lighted up boldwood's eye and his face flushed with the suppressed excitement of an unutterable thought
everybody's glance was now centred upon him and the unconscious bathsheba
he lifted her bodily off the ground and smoothed down the folds of her dress as a child might have taken a stormbeaten bird and arranged its ruffled plumes and bore her along the pavement to the king's arms inn
here he passed with her under the archway into a private room and by the time he had deposited  so lothly  the precious burden upon a sofa bathsheba had opened her eyes
remembering all that had occurred she murmured i want to go home
boldwood left the room
he stood for a moment in the passage to recover his senses
the experience had been too much for his consciousness to keep up with and now that he had grasped it it had gone again
for those few heavenly golden moments she had been in his arms
what did it matter about her not knowing it
she had been close to his breast he had been close to hers
he started onward again and sending a woman to her went out to ascertain all the facts of the case
these appeared to be limited to what he had already heard
he then ordered her horse to be put into the gig and when all was ready returned to inform her
he found that though still pale and unwell she had in the meantime sent for the budmouth man who brought the tidings and learnt from him all there was to know
being hardly in a condition to drive home as she had driven to town boldwood with every delicacy of manner and feeling offered to get her a driver or to give her a seat in his phaeton which was more com fortable than her own conveyance
these proposals bathsheba gently declined and the farmer at once de parted
about halfanhour later she invigorated herself by an effort and took her seat and the reins as usualin external appearance much as if nothing had happened
she went out of the town by a tortuous back street and drove slowly along unconscious of the road and the scene
the first shades of evening were showing them selves when bathsheba reached home where silently alighting and leaving the horse in the hands of the boy she proceeded at once upstairs
liddy met her on the landing
the news had preceded bathsheba to weather bury by halfanhour and liddy looked inquiringly into her mistress's face
bathsheba had nothing to say
she entered her bedroom and sat by the window and thought and thought till night enveloped her and the extreme lines only of her shape were visible
somebody came to the door knocked and opened it
well what is it liddy
she said
i was thinking there must be something got for you to wear
said liddy with hesitation
what do you mean
mourning
no no no
said bathsheba hurriedly
but i suppose there must be something done for poor     not at present i think
it is not necessary
why not ma'am
because he's still alive
how do you know that
said liddy amazed
i don't know it
but wouldn't it have been different or shouldn't i have heard more or wouldn't they have found him liddy
 ori don't know how it is but death would have been different from how this is
i am perfectly convinced that he is still alive
bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till monday when two circumstances conjoined to shake it
the first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper which beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable pre sumptive evidence of troy's death by drowning con tained the important testimony of a young mr barker md of budmouth who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident in a letter to the editor
in this he stated that he was passing over the cliff on the remoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting
at that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the mouth of the cove and guessed in an instant that there was but a poor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular powers
he drifted behind a projection of the coast and mr barker followed along the shore in the same direction
but by the time that he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to command a view of the sea beyond dusk had set in and nothing further was to be seen
the other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes when it became necessary for her to examine and identify them  though this had virtually been done long before by those who inspected the letters in his pockets
it was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation that troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing again almost immediately that the notion that anything but death could have prevented him was a perverse one to entertain
then bathsheba said to herself that others were assured in their opinion strange that she should not be
a strange reflection occurred to her causing her face to flush
suppose that troy had followed fanny into another world
had he done this intentionally yet contrived to make his death appear like an accident
nevertheless this thought of how the apparent might differ from the realmade vivid by her bygone jealousy of fanny and the remorse he had shown that night   did not blind her to the perception of a likelier difference less tragic but to herself far more disastrous
when alone late that evening beside a small fire and much calmed down bathsheba took troy's watch into her hand which had been restored to her with the rest of the articles belonging to him
she opened the case as he had opened it before her a week ago
there was the little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to this great explosion
he was hers and she was his they should be gone together
she said
i am nothing to either of them and why should i keep her hair
she took it in her hand and held it over the fire
noi'll not burn it i'll keep it in memory of her poor thing
she added snatching back her hand
chapter xlix    oak's advancement  a great hope   the later autumn and the winter drew on apace and the leaves lay thick upon the turf of the glades and the mosses of the woods
bathsheba having previously been living in a state of suspended feeling which was not suspense now lived in a mood of quietude which was not precisely peacefulness
while she had known him to be alive she could have thought of his death with equanimity but now that it might be she had lost him she regretted that he was not hers still
she kept the farm going raked in her profits without caring keenly about them and expended money on ventures because she had done so in bygone days which though not long gone by seemed infinitely removed from her present
she looked back upon that past over a great gulf as if she were now a dead person having the faculty of meditation still left in her by means of which like the mouldering gentlefolk of the poet's story she could sit and ponder what a gift life used to be
however one excellent result of her general apathy was the longdelayed installation of oak as bailiff but he having virtually exercised that function for a long time already the change beyond the substantial in crease of wages it brought was little more than a nominal one addressed to the outside world
boldwood lived secluded and inactive
much of his wheat and all his barley of that season had been spoilt by the rain
it sprouted grew into intricate mats and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls
the strange neglect which had produced this ruin and waste became the subject of whispered talk among all the people round and it was elicited from one of boldwood's men that forgetfulness had nothing to do with it for he had been reminded of the danger to his corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors dared to do
the sight of the pigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed to arouse boldwood and he one evening sent for oak
whether it was sug gested by bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not the farmer proposed at the interview that gabriel should undertake the superintendence of the lower farm as well as of bathsheba's because of the necessity boldwood felt for such aid and the impossibility of discovering a more trustworthy man
gabriel's malig nant star was assuredly setting fast
bathsheba when she learnt of this proposalfor oak was obliged to consult her  at first languidly objected
she considered that the two farms together were too extensive for the observation of one man
boldwood who was apparently determined by personal rather than commercial reasons suggested that oak should be furnished with a horse for his sole use when the plan would present no difficulty the two farms lying side by side
boldwood did not directly communicate with her during these negotiations only speaking to oak who was the gobetween throughout
all was harmoniously arranged at last and we now see oak mounted on a strong cob and daily trotting the length breadth of about two thousand acres in a cheerful spirit of surveillance as if the crops belonged to him  the actual mistress of the onehalf and the master of the other sitting in their respective homes in gloomy and sad seclusion
out of this there arose during the spring succeeding a talk in the parish that gabriel oak was feathering his nest fast
whatever d'ye think
said susan tall gable oak is coming it quite the dand
he now wears shining boots with hardly a hob in 'em two or three times aweek and a tall hat asundays and 'a hardly knows the name of smockfrock
when i see people strut enough to he cut up into bantam cocks i stand dormant with wonder and says no more
it was eventually known that gabriel though paid a fixed wage by bathsheba independent of the fluctua tions of agricultural profits had made an engagement with boldwood by which oak was to receive a share of the receipts  a small share certainly yet it was money of a higher quality than mere wages and capable of expansion in a way that wages were not
some were beginning to consider oak a near man for though his condition had thus far improved he lived in no better style than before occupying the same cottage paring his own potatoes mending his stockings and sometimes even making his bed with his own hands
but as oak was not only provokingly indifferent to public opinion but a man who clung persistently to old habits and usages simply because they were old there was room for doubt as to his motives
a great hope had latterly germinated in boldwood whose unreasoning devotion to bathsheba could only be characterized as a fond madness which neither time nor circumstance evil nor good report could weaken or destroy
this fevered hope had grown up again like a grain of mustardseed during the quiet which followed the hasty conjecture that troy was drowned
he nourished it fearfully and almost shunned the contemplation of it in earnest lest facts should reveal the wildness of the dream
bathsheba having at last been persuaded to wear mourning her appearance as she entered the church in that guise was in itself a weekly addition to his faith that a time was coming  very far off perhaps yet surely nearing  when his waiting on events should have its reward
how long he might have to wait he had not yet closely considered
what he would try to recognize was that the severe schooling she had been subjected to had made bathsheba much more con siderate than she had formerly been of the feelings of others and he trusted that should she be willing at any time in the future to marry any man at all that man would be himself
there was a substratum of good feeling in her her selfreproach for the injury she had thoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much greater extent than before her infatuation and disappointment
it would be possible to approach her by the channel of her good nature and to suggest a friendly businesslike compact between them for fulfilment at some future day keeping the passionate side of his desire entirely out of her sight
such was boldwood's hope
to the eyes of the middleaged bathsheba was perhaps additionally charming just now
her exuber ance of spirit was pruned down the original phantom of delight had shown herself to be not too bright for human nature's daily food and she had been able to enter this second poetical phase without losing much of the first in the process
bathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her old aunt at norcombe afforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring directly after her  now possibly in the ninth month of her widowhood  and endeavouring to get a notion of her middle of the haymaking and boldwood contrived to i am glad to see you out of doors lydia
he said she simpered and wondered in her heart why he i hope mrs
troy is quite well after her long the coldesthearted neighbour could scarcely say less she is quite well sir
yes cheerful
fearful did you say
o no
i merely said she was cheerful
tells you all her affairs
no sir
some of them
yes sir
mrs troy puts much confidence in you lydia and very wisely perhaps
she do sir
i've been with her all through her troubles and was with her at the time of mr
troy's going and all
and if she were to marry again i expect i should bide with her
she promises that you shall  quite natural
said the strategic lover throbbing throughout him at the presumption which liddy's words appeared to warrant   that his darling had thought of remarriage
no  she doesn't promise it exactly
i merely judge on my own account
yes yes i understand
when she alludes to the possibility of marrying again you conclude     she never do allude to it sir
said liddy thinking how very stupid mr boldwood was getting
of course not
he returned hastily his hope falling again
you needn't take quite such long reaches with your rake lydia  short and quick ones are best
well perhaps as she is absolute mistress again now it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her freedom
my mistress did certainly once say though not seriously that she supposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last year if she cared to risk mr
troy's coming back and claiming her
ah six years from the present time
said that she might
she might marry at once in every reasonable person's opinion whatever the lawyers may say to the contrary
have you been to ask them
said liddy innocently
not i
said boldwood growing red
liddy you needn't stay here a minute later than you wish so mr oak says
i am now going on a little farther
good afternoon
he went away vexed with himself and ashamed of having for this one time in his life done anything which could be called underhand
poor boldwood had no more skill in finesse than a batteringram and he was uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear stupid and what was worse mean
but he had after all lighted upon one fact by way of repayment
it was a singularly fresh and fascinating fact and though not without its sadness it was pertinent and real
in little more than six years from this time bathsheba might certainly marry him
there was something definite in that hope for admitting that there might have been no deep thought in her words to liddy about marriage they showed at least her creed on the matter
this pleasant notion was now continually in his mind
six years were a long time but how much shorter than never the idea he had for so long been obliged to endure
jacob had served twice seven years for rachel what were six for such a woman as this
he tried to like the notion of waiting for her better than that of winning her at once
boldwood felt his love to be so deep and strong and eternal that it was pos sible she had never yet known its full volume and this patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of giving sweet proof on the point
he would annihilate the six years of his life as if they were minutes  so little did he value his time on earth beside her love
he would let her see all those six years of intangible ether eal courtship how little care he had for anything but as it bore upon the consummation
meanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in which greenhill fair was held
this fair was frequently attended by the folk of weather bury
chapter l    the sheep fair  troy touches his wife's hand   greenhill was the nijni novgorod of south wessex and the busiest merriest noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair
this yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill which retained in good preservation the remains of an ancient earthwork consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval form encircling the top of the hill though somewhat broken down here and there
to each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding road ascended and the level green space of ten or fifteen acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair
a few permanent erections dotted the spot but the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their sojourn here
shepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started from home two or three days or even a week before the fair driving their charges a few miles each day  not more than ten or twelve  and resting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at pre viously chosen points where they fed having fasted since morning
the shepherd of each flock marched behind a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon his shoulders and in his hand his crook which he used as the staff of his pilgrimage
several of the sheep would get worn and lame and occasionally a lambing occurred on the road
to meet these contingencies there was frequently provided to accompany the flocks from the remoter points a pony and waggon into which the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the journey
the weatherbury farms however were no such long distance from the hill and those arrangements were not necessary in their case
but the large united flocks of bathsheba and farmer boldwood formed a valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much attention and on this account gabriel in addition to boldwood's shepherd and cain ball accompanied them along the way through the decayed old town of kings bere and upward to the plateau  old george the dog of course behind them
when the autumn sun slanted over greenhill this morning and lighted the dewy flat upon its crest nebu lous clouds of dust were to be seen floating between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect around in all directions
these gradually converged upon the base of the hill and the flocks became individually visible climbing the serpentine ways which led to the top
thus in a slow procession they entered the opening to which the roads tended multitude after multitude horned and hornless  blue flocks and red flocks buff flocks and brown flocks even green and salmontinted flocks according to the fancy of the colourist and custom of the farm
men were shouting dogs were barking with greatest animation but the thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown nearly indifferent to such terrors though they still bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi ences a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst of them like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate devotees
the great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of south downs and the old wessex horned breeds to the latter class bathsheba's and farmer boldwood's mainly belonged
these filed in about nine o'clock their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals a small pink and white ear nestling under each horn
before and behind came other varieties perfect leopards as to the full rich substance of their coats and only lacking the spots
there were also a few of the oxfordshire breed whose wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen hair though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate leicesters which were in turn less curly than the cots wolds
but the most picturesque by far was a small flock of exmoors which chanced to be there this year
their pied faces and legs dark and heavy horns tresses of wool hanging round their swarthy foreheads quite relieved the monotony of the flocks in that quarter
all these bleating panting and weary thousands had entered and were penned before the morning had far advanced the dog belonging to each flock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it
alleys for pedes trians intersected the pens which soon became crowded with buyers and sellers from far and near
in another part of the hill an altogether different scene began to force itself upon the eye towards mid day
a circular tent of exceptional newness and size was in course of erection here
as the day drew on the flocks began to change hands lightening the shep herd's responsibilities and they turned their attention to this tent and inquired of a man at work there whose soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time what was going on
the royal hippodrome performance of turpin's ride to york and the death of black bess
replied the man promptly without turning his eyes or leaving off trying
as soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly stimulating harmonies and the announce ment was publicly made black bess standing in a con spicuous position on the outside as a living proof if proof were wanted of the truth of the oracular utterances from the stage over which the people were to enter
these were so convinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both that they soon began to crowd in abundantly among the foremost being visible jan coggan and joseph poorgrass who were holiday keeping here today 'that's the great ruffen pushing me
screamed a woman in front of jan over her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest
how can i help pushing ye when the folk behind push me
said coggan in a deprecating tone turning without turning his body which was jammed as in a vice
there was a silence then the drums and trumpets again sent forth their echoing notes
the crowd was again ecstasied and gave another lurch in which coggan and poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon the women in front
o that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of she swayed like a reed shaken by the wind
now
said coggan appealing in an earnest voice to the public at large as it stood clustered about his shoulderblades
did ye ever hear such onreasonable woman as that
upon my carcase neighbours if i could only get out of this cheesewring the damn women might eat the show for me
don't ye lose yer temper jan
implored joseph poorgrass in a whisper
they might get their men to murder us for i think by the shine of their eyes that they be a sinful form of womankind
jan held his tongue as if he had no objection to be pacified to please a friend and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder poorgrass being flattened like a jumpingjack and the sixpence for admission which he had got ready halfanhour earlier having become so reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the woman in spangles brazen rings set with glass diamonds and with chalked face and shoulders who took the money of him hastily dropped it again from a fear that some trick had been played to burn her fingers
so they all entered and the cloth of the tent to the eyes of an observer on the outside became bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on a sack of potatoes caused by the various human heads backs and elbows at high pressure within
at the rear of the large tent there were two small dressingtents
one of these alloted to the male per formers was partitioned into halves by a cloth and in one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass pull ing on a pair of jackboots a young man whom we instantly recognise as sergeant troy
troy's appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for
the brig aboard which he was taken in budmouth roads was about to start on a voyage though somewhat short of hands
troy read the articles and joined but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the bay to lulwind cove as he had half expected his clothes were gone
he ultimately worked his passage to the united states where he made a precarious living in various towns as professor of gymnastics sword exercise fencing and pugilism
a few months were sufficient to give him a distaste for this kind of life
there was a certain animal form of refinement in his nature and however pleasant a strange condition might be whilst privations were easily warded off it was dis advantageously coarse when money was short
there was ever present too the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts did he but chose to return to england and weatherbury farm
whether bathsheba thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious conjecture
to england he did return at last but the but the fact of drawing nearer to weatherbury abstracted its fascinations and his intention to enter his old groove at the place became modified
it was with gloom he con sidered on landing at liverpool that if he were to go home his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con template for what troy had in the way of emotion was an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and healthy kind
bathsheba was not a women to be made a fool of or a woman to suffer in silence and how could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom at first entering he would be beholden for food and lodging
moreover it was not at all unlikely that his wife would fail at her farming if she had not already done so and he would then become liable for her maintenance  and what a life such a future of poverty with her would be the spectre of fanny constantly be tween them harrowing his temper and embittering her words
thus for reasons touching on distaste regret and shame commingled he put off his return from day to day and would have decided to put it off altogether if he could have found anywhere else the readymade establishment which existed for him there
at this time  the july preceding the september in which we find at greenhill fair  he fell in with a travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of a northern town
troy introduced himself to the manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe hitting a suspended apple with pistol bullet fired from the animal's back when in full gallop and other feats
for his merits in these  all more or less based upon his ex periences as a dragoonguardsman  troy was taken into the company and the play of turpin was prepared with a view to his personation of the chief character
troy was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which he was undoubtedly treated but he thought the engage ment might afford him a few weeks for consideration
it was thus carelessly and without having formed any definite plan for the future that troy found himself at greenhill fair with the rest of the company on this day
and now the mild autumn sun got lower and in front of the pavilion the following incident had taken place
bathsheba  who was driven to the fair that day by her odd man poorgrass  had like every one else read or heard the announcement that mr francis the great cosmopolitan equestrian and roughrider would enact the part of turpin and she was not yet too old and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him
this particular show was by far the largest and grandest in the fair a horde of little shows grouping themselves under its shade like chickens around a hen
the crowd had passed in and boldwood who had been watching all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her seeing her comparatively isolated came up to her side
i hope the sheep have done well today mrs
troy
he said nervously
o yes thank you
said bathsheba colour springing up in the centre of her cheeks
i was fortunate enough to sell them all just as we got upon the hill so we hadn't to pen at all
and now you are entirely at leisure
yes except that i have to see one more dealer in two hours' time  otherwise i should be going home
he was looking at this large tent and the announcement
have you ever seen the play of turpin's ride to york
turpin was a real man was he not
o yes perfectly true  all of it
indeed i think i've heard jan coggan say that a relation of his knew tom king turpin's friend quite well
coggan is rather given to strange stories connected with his relations we must remember
i hope they can all be believed
yes yes we know coggan
but turpin is true enough
you have never seen it played i suppose
never
i was not allowed to go into these places when i was young
hark
what's that prancing
how they shout
black bess just started off i suppose
am i right in supposing you would like to see the performance mrs
troy
please excuse my mistake if it is one but if you would like to i'll get a seat for you with pleasure
perceiving that she hesitated he added i myself shall not stay to see it i've seen it before
now bathsheba did care a little to see the show and had only withheld her feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone
she had been hoping that oak might appear whose assistance in such cases was always accepted as an inalienable right but oak was nowhere to be seen and hence it was that she said then if you will just look in first to see if there's room i think i will go in for a minute or two
and so a short time after this bathsheba appeared in the tent with boldwood at her elbow who taking her to a reserved seat again withdrew
this feature consisted of one raised bench in very conspicuous part of the circle covered with red cloth and floored with a piece of carpet and bathsheba immediately found to her confusion that she was the single reserved individual in the tent the rest of the crowded spectators one and all standing on their legs on the borders of the arena where they got twice as good a view of the performance for half the money
hence as many eyes were turned upon her enthroned alone in this place of honour against a scarlet back ground as upon the ponies and clown who were engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre turpin not having yet appeared
once there bathsheba was forced to make the best of it and remain she sat down spreading her skirts with some dignity over the unoccupied space on each side of her and giving a new and feminine aspect to the pavilion
in a few minutes she noticed the fat red nape of coggan's neck among those standing just below her and joseph poor grass's saintly profile a little further on
the interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade
the strange luminous semiopacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into rembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and divisions in the canvas and spirted like jets of golddust across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent until they alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite and shone like little lamps suspended there
troy on peeping from his dressingtent through a slit for a reconnoitre before entering saw his unconscious wife on high before him as described sitting as queen of the tournament
he started back in utter confusion for although his disguise effectually concealed his person ality he instantly felt that she would be sure to recognize his voice
he had several times during the day thought of the possibility of some weatherbury person or other appearing and recognizing him but he had taken the risk carelessly
if they see me let them he had said
but here was bathsheba in her own person and the reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of his prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough considered the point
she looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about weatherbury people was changed
he had not expected her to exercise this power over him in the twinkling of an eye
should he go on and care nothing
he could not bring himself to do that
beyond a politic wish to remain unknown there suddenly arose in him now a sense of shame at the possibility that his attractive young wife who already despised him should despise him more by discovering him in so mean a condition after so long a time
he actually blushed at the thought and was vexed beyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards weatherbury should have led him to dally about the country in this way
but troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit's end
he hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing space from that of the manager and proprietor who now appeared as the individual called tom king as far down as his waist and as the aforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes
here's the devil to pay
said troy
how's that
why there's a blackguard creditor in the tent i don't want to see who'll discover me and nab me as sure as satan if i open my mouth
what's to be done
you must appear now i think
i can't
but the play must proceed
do you give out that turpin has got a bad cold and can't speak his part but that he'll perform it just the same without speaking
the proprietor shook his head
anyhow play or no play i won't open my mouth said troy firmly
very well then let me see
i tell you how we'll manage
said the other who perhaps felt it would be extremely awkward to offend his leading man just at this time
i won't tell 'em anything about your keeping silence go on with the piece and say nothing doing what you can by a judicious wink now and then and a few indomitable nods in the heroic places you know
they'll never find out that the speeches are omitted
this seemed feasible enough for turpin's speeches were not many or long the fascination of the piece lying entirely in the action and accordingly the play began and at the appointed time black bess leapt into the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators
at the turnpike scene where bess and turpin are hotly pursued at midnight by the officers and halfawake gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap denies that any horseman has passed coggan uttered a broadchested well done
which could be heard all over the fair above the bleating and poorgrass smiled delightedly with a nice sense of dramatic contrast between our hero who coolly leaps the gate and halting justice in the form of his enemies who must needs pull up cumbersomely and wait to be let through
at the death of tom king he could not refrain from seizing coggan by the hand and whispering with tears in his eyes of course he's not really shot jan    only seemingly
and when the last sad scene came on and the body of the gallant and faithful bess had to be carried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from among the spectators nothing could restrain poorgrass from lending a hand exclaiming as he asked jan to join him twill be something to tell of at warren's in future years jan and hand down to our children
for many a year in weatherbury joseph told with the air of a man who had had experiences in his time that he touched with his own hand the hoof of bess as she lay upon the board upon his shoulder
if as some thinkers hold immortality consists in being enshrined in others memories then did black bess become immortal that day if she never had done so before
meanwhile troy had added a few touches to his ordinary makeup for the character the more effectually to disguise himself and though he had felt faint qualms on first entering the metamorphosis effected by judici ously lining his face with a wire rendered him safe from the eyes of bathsheba and her men
nevertheless he was relieved when it was got through
there a second performance in the evening and the tent was lighted up
troy had taken his part very quietly this time venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion and was just concluding it when whilst standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first row of spectators he observed within a yard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features
troy hastily shifted his position after having recognized in sworn enemy who still hung about the outskirts of at first troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances
that he had been recognized by this man was highly probable yet there was room for a doubt
then the great objection he had felt to allowing news of his proximity to precede him to weatherbury in the event of his return based on a feeling that knowledge of his present occupation would discredit him still further in his wife's eyes returned in full force
moreover should he resolve not to return at all a tale of his being alive and being in the neighbourhood would be awkward and he was anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's temporal affairs before deciding which to do
in this dilemma troy at once went out to recon noitre
it occurred to him that to find pennyways and make a friend of him if possible would be a very wise act
he had put on a thick beard borrowed from the establishment and this he wandered about the fair field
it was now almost dark and respectable people were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home the largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town
this was considered an unexceptionable place for obtaining the necessary food and rest host trencher as he was jauntily called by the local newspaper being a sub stantial man of high repute for catering through all the county round
the tent was divided into first and secondclass compartments and at the end of the first class division was a yet further enclosure for the most exclusive fenced of from the body of the tent by a luncheonbar behind which the host himself stood bustling about in white apron and shirtsleeves and look ing as if he had never lived anywhere but under canvas all his life
in these penetralia were chairs and a table which on candles being lighted made quite a cozy and luxurious show with an urn plated tea and coffee pots china teacups and plum cakes
troy stood at the entrance to the booth where a gipsywoman was frying pancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a penny apiece and looked over the heads of the people within
he could see nothing of pennyways but he soon discerned bathsheba through an opening into the reserved space at the further end
troy thereupon retreated went round the tent into the darkness and listened
he could hear bathsheba's voice immediately inside the canvas she was conversing with a man
a warmth overspread his face surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair
he wondered if then she reckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty
to get at the root of the matter troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth which by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a wafer
close to this he placed his face withdrawing it again in a movement of surprise for his eye had been within twelve inches of the top of bathsheba's head
lt was too near to be convenient
he made another hole a little to one side and lower down in a shaded place beside her chair from which it was easy and safe to survey her by looking horizontally'
troy took in the scene completely now
she was leaning back sipping a cup of tea that she held in her hand and the owner of the male voice was boldwood who had apparently just brought the cup to her bathsheba being in a negligent mood leant so idly against the canvas that it was pressed to the shape of her shoulder and she was in fact as good as in troy's arms and he was obliged to keep his breast carefully backward that she might not feel its warmth through the cloth as he gazed in
troy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred again within him as they had been stirred earlier in the day
she was handsome as ever and she was his
it was some minutes before he could counteract his sudden wish to go in and claim her
then he thought how the proud girl who had always looked down upon him even whilst it was to love him would hate him on dis covering him to be a strolling player
were he to make himself known that chapter of his life must at all risks be kept for ever from her and from the weatherbury people or his name would be a byword throughout the parish
he would be nicknamed turpin as long as he lived
assuredly before he could claim her these few past months of his existence must be entirely blotted out
shall i get you another cup before you start ma'am
said farmer boldwood
i thank you said bathsheba
but i must be going at once
it was great neglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late
i should have gone two hours ago if it had not been for him
i had no idea of coming in here but there's nothing so refreshing as a cup of tea though i should never have got one if you hadn't helped me
troy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles and watched each varying shade thereon and the white shelllike sinuosities of her little ear
she took out her purse and was insisting to boldwood on paying for her tea for herself when at this moment pennyways entered the tent
troy trembled  here was his scheme for respectability endangered at once
he was about to leave his hole of espial attempt to follow pennyways and find out if the exbailiff had recognized him when he was arrested by the conversation and found he was too late
excuse me ma'am
said pennyways i've some private information for your ear alone
i cannot hear it now
she said coldly
that bathsheba could not endure this man was evident in fact he was continually coming to her with some tale or other by which he might creep into favour at the expense of persons maligned
i'll write it down
said pennyways confidently
he stooped over the table pulled a leaf from a warped pocketbook and wrote upon the paper in a round hand  your husband is here
i've seen him
who's the fool now
this he folded small and handed towards her
bathsheba would not read it she would not even put out her hand to take it
pennyways then with a laugh of derision tossed it into her lap and turning away left her
from the words and action of pennyways troy though he had not been able to see what the exbailiff wrote had not a moment's doubt that the note referred to him
nothing that he could think of could be done to check the exposure
curse my luck
he whispered and added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind
meanwhile boldwood said taking up the note from her lap  don't you wish to read it mrs
troy
if not i'll destroy it
oh well
said bathsheba carelessly perhaps it is unjust not to read it but i can guess what it is about
he wants me to recommend him or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected with my work people
he's always doing that
bathsheba held the note in her right hand
bold wood handed towards her a plate of cut breadand butter when in order to take a slice she put the note into her left hand where she was still holding the purse and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to the canvas
the moment had come for saving his game and troy impulsively felt that he would play the card for yet another time he looked at the fair hand and saw the pink fingertips and the blue veins of the wrist encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which she wore how familiar it all was to him
then with the lightning action in which he was such an adept he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the tentcloth which was far from being pinned tightly down lifted it a little way keeping his eye to the hole snatched the note from her fingers dropped the canvas and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from her
troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards ascended again and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of the tent
his object was now to get to pennyways and prevent a repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose
troy reached the tent door and standing among the groups there gathered looked anxiously for pennyways evidently not wishing to make himself prominent by inquiring for him
one or two men were speaking of a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her
it was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note for he had seized it and made off with it leaving her purse behind
his chagrin and disappointment at dis covering its worthlessness would be a good joke it was said
however the occurrence seemed to have become known to few for it had not interrupted a fiddler who had lately begun playing by the door of the tent nor the four bowed old men with grim countenances and walkingsticks in hand who were dancing major malley's reel to the tune
behind these stood pennyways
troy glided up to him beckoned and whispered a few words and with a mutual glance of concurrence the two men went into the night together
chapter li    bathsheba talks with her outrider   the arrangement for getting back again to weather bury had been that oak should take the place of poor grass in bathsheba's conveyance and drive her home it being discovered late in the afternoon that joseph was suffering from his old complaint a multiplying eye and was therefore hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman
but oak had found himself so occupied and was full of so many cares relative to those portions of boldwood's flocks that were not disposed of that bathsheba without telling oak or anybody resolved to drive home herself as she had many times done from casterbridge market and trust to her good angel for performing the journey un molested
but having fallen in with farmer boldwood accidentally on her part at least at the refreshment tent she found it impossible to refuse his offer to ride on horseback beside her as escort
it had grown twilight before she was aware but boldwood assured her that there was no cause for uneasiness as the moon would be up in halfanhour
immediately after the incident in the tent she had risen to go  now absolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover's protection  though regretting gabriel's absence whose company she would have much preferred as being more proper as well as more pleasant since he was her own managingman and servant
this how ever could not be helped she would not on any consideration treat boldwood harshly having once already illused him and the moon having risen and the gig being ready she drove across the hilltop in the wending way's which led downwards  to oblivious obscurity as it seemed for the moon and the hill it flooded with light were in appearance on a level the rest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between them
boldwood mounted his horse and followed in close attendance behind
thus they descended into the lowlands and the sounds of those left on the hill came like voices from the sky and the lights were as those of a camp in heaven
they soon passed the merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill traversed kingsbere and got upon the high road
the keen instincts of bathsheba had perceived that the farmer's staunch devotion to herself was still un diminished and she sympathized deeply
the sight had quite depressed her this evening had reminded her of her folly she wished anew as she had wished many months ago for some means of making repara tion for her fault
hence her pity for the man who so persistently loved on to his own injury and per manent gloom had betrayed bathsheba into an injudi cious considerateness of manner which appeared almost like tenderness and gave new vigour to the exquisite dream of a jacob's seven years service in poor boldwood's mind
he soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear and rode close by her side
they had gone two or three miles in the moonlight speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning the fair farming oak's usefulness to them both and other indifferent subjects when boldwood said suddenly and simply  mrs
troy you will marry again some day
this pointblank query unmistakably confused her it was not till a minute or more had elapsed that she said i have not seriously thought of any such subject
i quite understand that
yet your late husband has been dead nearly one year and   you forget that his death was never absolutely proved and may not have taken place so that i may not be really a widow
she said catching at the straw of escape that the fact afforded not absolutely proved perhaps but it was proved circumstantially
a man saw him drowning too
no reasonable person has any doubt of his death nor have you ma'am i should imagine
o yes i have or i should have acted differently she said gently
from the first i have had a strange uaccountable feeling that he could not have perished but i have been able to explain that in several ways since
even were i half persuaded that i shall see him no more i am far from thinking of marriage with another
i should be very contemptible to indulge in such a thought
they were silent now awhile and having struck into an unfrequented track across a common the creaks of boldwood's saddle and gig springs were all the sounds to be heard
boldwood ended the pause
do you remember when i carried you fainting in my arms into the king's arms in casterbridge
every dog has his day that was mine
i knowi know it all
she said hurriedly
i for one shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as to deny you to me
i too am very sorry
she said and then checked herself
i mean you know i am sorry you thought i   i have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times with you  that i was something to you before he was anything and that you belonged almost to me
but of course that's nothing
you never liked me
i did and respected you too
do you now
yes
which
how do you mean which
do you like me or do you respect me
i don't know  at least i cannot tell you
it is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs
my treatment of you was thoughtless inexcusable wicked
i shall eternally regret it
if there had been anything i could have done to make amends i would most gladly have done it  there was nothing on earth i so longed to do as to repair the error
but that was not possible
don't blame yourself  you were not so far in the wrong as you suppose
bathsheba suppose you had real complete proof that you are what in fact you are   a widow  would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying me
i cannot say
i shouldn't yet at any rate
but you might at some future time of your life
o yes i might at some time
well then do you know that without further proof of any kind you may marry again in about six years from the present  subject to nobody's objection or blame
o yes
she said quickly
i know all that
but don't talk of it  seven or six years  where may we all be by that time
they will soon glide by and it will seem an astonishingly short time to look back upon when they are past  much less than to look forward to now
yes yes i have found that in my own experience
now listen once more
boldwood pleaded
if i wait that time will you marry me
you own that you owe me amends  let that be your way of making them
but mr boldwood  six years   do you want to be the wife of any other man
no indeed
i mean that i don't like to talk about this matter now
perhaps it is not proper and i ought not to allow it
let us drop it
my husband may be living as i said
of course i'll drop the subject if you wish
but propriety has nothing to do with reasons
i am a middleaged man willing to protect you for the remainder of our lives
on your side at least there is no passion or blamable haste  on mine perhaps there is
but i can't help seeing that if you choose from a feeling of pity and as you say a wish to make amends to make a bargain with me for a farahead time  an agreement which will set all things right and make me happy late though it may be  there is no fault to be found with you as a woman
hadn't i the first place beside you
haven't you been almost mine once already
surely you can say to me as much as this you will have me back again should circumstances permit
now pray speak
o bathsheba promise  it is only a little promise  that if you marry again you will marry me
his tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment even whilst she sympathized
it was a simple physical fear  the weak of the strong there no emotional aversion or inner repugnance
she said with some distress in her voice for she remembered vividly his outburst on the yalbury road and shrank from a repetition of his anger  i will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife whatever comes  but to say more  you have taken me so by surprise   but let it stand in these simple words  that in six years' time you will be my wife
unexpected accidents we'll not mention because those of course must be given way to
now this time i know you will keep your word
that's why i hesitate to give it
but do give it
remember the past and be kind
she breathed and then said mournfully  o what shall i do
i don't love you and i much fear that i never shall love you as much as a woman ought to love a husband
if you sir know that and i can yet give you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six years if my husband should not come back it is a great honour to me
and if you value such an act of friendship from a woman who doesn't esteem her self as she did and has little love left why it will   promise
  consider if i cannot promise soon
but soon is perhaps never
o no it is not
i mean soon
christmas we'll say
christmas
he said nothing further till he added  well i'll say no more to you about it till that time
bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind which showed how entirely the soul is the slave of the body the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon the tangible flesh and blood
it is hardly too much to say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than her own will not only into the act of promising upon this singularly remote and vague matter but into the emo tion of fancying that she ought to promise
when the weeks intervening between the night of this conversa tion and christmas day began perceptibly to diminish her anxiety and perplexity increased
one day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential dialogue with gabriel about her difficulty it afforded her a little relief  of a dull and cheerless kind
they were auditing accounts and something occurred in the course of their labours which led oak to say speaking of boldwood  he'll never forget you ma'am never
then out came her trouble before she was aware and she told him how she had again got into the toils what boldwood had asked her and how he was ex pecting her assent
the most mournful reason of all for my agreeing to it
she said sadly and the true reason why i think to do so for good or for evil is this   it is a thing i have not breathed to a living soul as yeti believe that if i don't give my word he'll go out of his mind
really do ye
said gabriel gravely
i believe this
she continued with reckless frank ness and heaven knows i say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain for i am grieved and troubled to my soul about iti believe i hold that man's future in my hand
his career depends entirely upon my treatment of him
o gabriel i tremble at my responsibility for it is terrible
well i think this much ma'am as i told you years ago
said oak that his life is a total blank whenever he isn't hoping for 'ee but i can't supposei hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy
his natural manner has always been dark and strange you know
but since the case is so sad and oddlike why don't ye give the conditional promise
i think i would
but is it right
some rash acts of my past life have taught me that a watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a very little credit and i do want and long to be discreet in this
and six years  why we may all be in our graves by that bathsheba talks with oak time even if mr
troy does not come back again which he may not impossibly do
such thoughts give a sort of absurdity to the scheme
now isn't it preposterous gabriel
however he came to dream of it i cannot think
but is it wrong
you know  you are older than i
eight years older ma'am
yes eight years  and is it wrong
perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to make  i don't see anything really wrong about it
said oak slowly
in fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under any condition that is your not caring about him   for i may suppose     yes you may suppose that love is wanting
she said shortly
love is an utterly bygone sorry worn out miserable thing with me  for him or any one else
well your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away harm from such an agreement with him
if wild heat had to do wi' it making ye long to over come the awkwardness about your husband's vanishing it mid be wrong but a coldhearted agreement to oblige a man seems different somehow
the real sin ma'am in my mind lies in thinking of ever wedding wi' a man you don't love honest and true
that i'm willing to pay the penalty of
said bath sheba firmly
you know gabriel this is what i can not get off my conscience  that i once seriously injured him in sheer idleness
if i had never played a trick upon him he would never have wanted to marry me
o if i could only pay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm i did and so get the sin off my soul that way
well there's the debt which can only be discharged in one way and i believe i am bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power without any consideration of my own future at all
when a rake gambles away his expectations the fact that it is an inconvenient debt doesn't make him the less liable
i've been a rake and the single point i ask you is con sidering that my own scruples and the fact that in the eye of the law my husband is only missing will keep any man from marrying me until seven years have passed  am i free to entertain such an idea even though 'tis a sort of penance  for it will be that
i hate the act of marriage under such circumstances and the class of women i should seem to belong to by doing it
it seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you think as everybody else do that your husband is dead
i shall get to i suppose because i cannot help feeling what would have brought him back long before this time if he had lived
well then in religious sense you will be as free to think o' marrying again as any real widow of one year's standing
but why don't ye ask mr thirdly's advice on how to treat mr
boldwood
no
when i want a broadminded opinion for general enlightenment distinct from special advice i never go to a man who deals in the subject pro fessionally
so i like the parson's opinion on law the lawyer's on doctoring the doctor's on business and my businessman's  that is yours  on morals
and on love     my own
i'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument
said oak with a grave smile
she did not reply at once and then saying good evening mr
oak
went away
she had spoken frankly and neither asked nor ex pected any reply from gabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained
yet in the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute a little pang of disappointment for a reason she would not allow herself to recognize
oak had not once wished her free that he might marry her himself  had not once said i could wait for you as well as he
that was the insect sting
not that she would have listened to any such hypothesis
o no  for wasn't she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future were improper and wasn't gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her
yet he might have just hinted about that old love of his and asked in a playful offhand way if he might speak of it
it would have seemed pretty and sweet if no more and then she would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman's no can sometimes be
but to give such cool advice   the very advice she had asked for  it ruffled our heroine all the afternoon
chapter lii    converging courses                          i christmaseve came and a party that boldwood was to give in the evening was the great subject of talk in weatherbury
it was not that the rarity of christmas parties in the parish made this one a wonder but that boldwood should be the giver
the announcement had had an abnormal and incongruous sound as if one should hear of croquetplaying in a cathedral aisle or that some muchrespected judge was going upon the stage
that the party was intended to be a truly jovial one there was no room for doubt
a large bough of mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day and suspended in the hall of the bachelor's home
holly and ivy had followed in armfuls
from six that morning till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest the kettle the saucepan and the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames like shadrach meshach and abednego moreover roasting and basting operations were continually carried on in front of the genial blaze
as it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which the staircase descended and all encumbrances were cleared out for dancing
the log which was to form the backbrand of the evening fire was the uncleft trunk of a tree so unwieldy that it could be neither brought nor rolled to its place and accord ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew near
ii in spite of all this the spirit of revelry was wanting in the atmosphere of the house
such a thing had never been attempted before by its owner and it was now done as by a wrench
intended gaieties would insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs the organ ization of the whole effort was carried out coldly by hirelings and a shadow seemed to move about the rooms saying that the proceedings were unnatural to the place and the lone man who lived therein and hence not good
bathsheba was at this time in her room dressing for the event
she had called for candles and liddy entered and placed one on each side of her mistress's glass
don't go away liddy
said bathsheba almost timidly
i am foolishly agitatedi cannot tell why
i wish i had not been obliged to go to this dance but there's no escaping now
i have not spoken to mr boldwood since the autumn when i promised to see him at christmas on business but i had no idea there was to be anything of this kind
but i would go now
said liddy who was going with her for boldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations
yes i shall make my appearance of course
said bathsheba
but i am the cause of the party and that upsets me
 don't tell liddy
o no ma'am you the cause of it ma'am
yes
i am the reason of the partyi
if it had not been for me there would never have been one
i can't explain any more  there's no more to be explained
i wish i had never seen weatherbury
that's wicked of you  to wish to be worse off than you are
no liddy
i have never been free from trouble since i have lived here and this party is likely to bring me more
now fetch my black silk dress and see how it sits upon me
but you will leave off that surely ma'am
you have been a widowlady fourteen months and ought to brighten up a little on such a night as this
is it necessary
no i will appear as usual for if i were to wear any light dress people would say things about me and i should seem to he rejoicing when i am solemn all the time
the party doesn't suit me a bit but never mind stay and help to finish me off
iii boldwood was dressing also at this hour
a tailor from casterbridge was with him assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat that had just been brought home
never had boldwood been so fastidious unreasonable about the fit and generally difficult to please
the tailor walked round and round him tugged at the waist pulled the sleeve pressed out the collar and for the first time in his experience boldwood was not bored times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an earthquake in south america
boldwood at last expressed himself nearly satisfied and paid the bill the tailor passing out of the door just as oak came in to report progress for the day
oh oak
said boldwood
i shall of course see you here tonight
make yourself merry
i am deter mined that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared
i'll try to be here sir though perhaps it may not be very early
said gabriel quietly
i am glad indeed to see such a change in 'ee from what it used to be
yesi must own iti am bright tonight  cheerful and more than cheerfulso much so that i am almost sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away
and sometimes when i am excessively hopeful and blithe a trouble is looming in the distance  so that i often get to look upon gloom in me with content and to fear a happy mood
still this may be absurdi feel that it is absurd
perhaps my day is dawning at last
i hope it 'ill be a long and a fair one
thank you  thank you
yet perhaps my cheerful mess rests on a slender hope
and yet i trust my hope
it is faith not hope
i think this time i reckon with my host
 oak my hands are a little shaky or some thing i can't tie this neckerchief properly
perhaps you will tie it for me
the fact is i have not been well lately you know
i am sorry to hear that sir
oh it's nothing
i want it done as well as you can please
is there any late knot in fashion oak
i don't know sir
said oak
his tone had sunk to sadness
boldwood approached gabriel and as oak tied the neckerchief the farmer went on feverishly  does a woman keep her promise gabriel
if it is not inconvenient to her she may
 or rather an implied promise
i won't answer for her implying
said oak with faint bitterness
that's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with them
oak don't talk like that
you have got quite cynical lately  how is it
we seem to have shifted our positions i have become the young and hopeful man and you the old and unbelieving one
however does a woman keep a promise not to marry but to enter on an engagement to marry at some time
now you know women better than i  tell me
i am afeard you honour my understanding too much
however she may keep such a promise if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a wrong
it has not gone far yet but i think it will soon  yes i know it will
he said in an impulsive whisper
i have pressed her upon the subject and she inclines to be kind to me and to think of me as a husband at a long future time and that's enough for me
how can i expect more
she has a notion that a woman should not marry within seven years of her husband's disappearance  that her own self shouldn't i mean  because his body was not found
it may be merely this legal reason which influences her or it may be a religious one but she is reluctant to talk on the point yet she has promised  implied  that she will ratify an engagement tonight
seven years
murmured oak
no no  it's no such thing
he said with im patience
five years nine months and a few days
fifteen months nearly have passed since he vanished and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of little more than five years
it seems long in a forward view
don't build too much upon such promises sir
remember you have once be'n deceived
her meaning may be good but there  she's young yet
deceived
never
said boldwood vehemently
she never promised me at that first time and hence she did not break her promise
if she promises me she'll marry me bathsheba is a woman to her word
iv troy was sitting in a corner of the white hart tavern at casterbridge smoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass
a knock was given at the door and pennyways entered
well have you seen him
troy inquired pointing to a chair
boldwood
no  lawyer long
he wadn' at home
i went there first too
that's a nuisance
'tis rather i suppose
yet i don't see that because a man appears to be drowned and was not he should be liable for anything
i shan't ask any lawyer  not i
but that's not it exactly
if a man changes his name and so forth and takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife he's a cheat and that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue and that is ayless a lammocken vagabond and that's a punishable situation
haha
well done pennyways
troy had laughed but it was with some anxiety that he said now what i want to know is this do you think there's really anything going on between her and boldwood
upon my soul i should never have believed it
how she
must detest me
have you found out whether she has encouraged him
i haen't been able to learn
there's a deal of feeling on his side seemingly but i don't answer for her
i didn't know a word about any such thing till yesterday and all i heard then was that she was gwine to the party at his house tonight
this is the first time she has ever gone there they say
and they say that she've not so much as spoke to him since they were at greenhill fair but what can folk believe o't
how ever she's not fond of him  quite offish and quite care less i know
i'm not so sure of that she's a handsome woman pennyways is she not
own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life
upon my honour when i set eyes upon her that day i wondered what i could have been made of to be able to leave her by herself so long
and then i was hampered with that bothering show which i'm free of at last thank the stars
he smoked on awhile and then added how did she look when you passed by yesterday
oh she took no great heed of me ye may well fancy but she looked well enough far's i know
just flashed her haughty eyes upon my poor scram body and then let them go past me to what was yond much as if i'd been no more than a leafless tree
she had just got off her mare to look at the last wringdown of cider for the year she had been riding and so her colours were up and her breath rather quick so that her bosom plimmed and feliplimmed and felievery time plain to my eye
ay and there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying ware o' the pommy ma'am  'twill spoil yer gown
never mind me says she
then gabe brought her some of the new cider and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote and not in a nateral way at all
liddy says she bring indoors a few gallons and i'll make some ciderwine
sergeant i was no more to her than a morsel of scroffin the fuel house
i must go and find her out at once  o yes i see thati must go
oak is head man still isn't he
yes 'a b'lieve
and at little weatherbury farm too
he manages everything
twill puzzle him to manage her or any other man of his compass
i don't know about that
she can't do without him and knowing it well he's pretty independent
and she've a few soft corners to her mind though i've never been able to get into one the devil's in't
ah baily she's a notch above you and you must own it a higher class of animala finer tissue
how ever stick to me and neither this haughty goddess dashing piece of womanhood junowife of mine juno was a goddess you know nor anybody else shall hurt you
but all this wants looking into i perceive
what with one thing and another i see that my work is well cut out for me
v how do i look tonight liddy
said bathsheba giving a final adjustment to her dress before leaving the glass
i never saw you look so well before
yesi'll tell you when you looked like it  that night a year and a half ago when you came in so wildlike and scolded us for making remarks about you and mr
troy
everybody will think that i am setting myself to captivate mr boldwood i suppose
she murmured
at least they'll say so
can't my hair be brushed down a little flatter
i dread going  yet i dread the risk of wounding him by staying away
anyhow ma'am you can't well be dressed plainer than you are unless you go in sackcloth at once
'tis your excitement is what makes you look so noticeable tonight
i don't know what's the matter i feel wretched at one time and buoyant at another
i wish i could have continued quite alone as i have been for the last year or so with no hopes and no fears and no pleasure and no grief
now just suppose mr boldwood should ask you   only just suppose it  to run away with him what would you do ma'am
liddy  none of that
said bathsheba gravely
mind i won't hear joking on any such matter
do you hear
i beg pardon ma'am
but knowing what rum things we women be i just said  however i won't speak of it again
no marrying for me yet for many a year if ever twill be for reasons very very different from those you think or others will believe
now get my cloak for it is time to go
vi oak said boldwood before you go i want to mention what has been passing in my mind lately  that little arrangement we made about your share in the farm i mean
that share is small too small consider ing how little i attend to business now and how much time and thought you give to it
well since the world is brightening for me i want to show my sense of it by increasing your proportion in the partnership
i'll make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck me as likely to be convenient for i haven't time to talk about it now and then we'll discuss it at our leisure
my intention is ultimately to retire from the manage ment altogether and until you can take all the expendi ture upon your shoulders i'll be a sleeping partner in the stock
then if i marry her  and i hopei feel i shall why     pray don't speak of it sir
said oak hastily
we don't know what may happen
so many upsets may befall 'ee
there's many a slip as they say  and i would advise youi know you'll pardon me this once  not to be too sure
i know i know
but the feeling i have about in creasing your share is on account of what i know of you oak i have learnt a little about your secret your interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em ployer
but you have behaved like a man and i as a sort of successful rivalsuccessful partly through your goodness of heart  should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship under what must have been a great pain to you
o that's not necessary thank 'ee
said oak hurriedly
i must get used to such as that other men have and so shall i
oak then left him
he was uneasy on boldwood's account for he saw anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once had been
as boldwood continued awhile in his room alone  ready and dressed to receive his company  the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity
he looked out of the window and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the sky and the twilight deepening to darkness
then he went to a locked closet and took from a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox and was about to put it into his pocket
but he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary glance inside
it contained a woman's fingerring set all the way round with small diamonds and from its appearance had evidently been recently purchased
boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long time though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain from his manner and mien which were those of a mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel's future history
the noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible
boldwood closed the box stowed it away carefully in his pocket and went out upon the landing
the old man who was his indoor factotum came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs
they be coming sir  lots of 'em  afoot and a driving
i was coming down this moment
those wheels i heard  is it mrs
troy
no sir  'tis not she yet
a reserved and sombre expression had returned to boldwood's face again but it poorly cloaked his feel ings when he pronounced bathsheba's name and his feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh as he went down the stairs
vii how does this cover me
said troy to pennyways nobody would recognize me now i'm sure
he was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of noachian cut with cape and high collar the latter being erect and rigid like a girdling wall and nearly reaching to the verge of travelling cap which was pulled down over his ears
pennyways snuffed the candle and then looked up and deliberately inspected troy you've made up your mind to go then
he said
made up my mind
yes of course i have
why not write to her
'tis a very queer corner that you have got into sergeant
you see all these things will come to light if you go back and they won't sound well at all
faith if i was you i'd even bide as you be   a single man of the name of francis
a good wife is good but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all
now that's my outspoke mind and i've been called a longheaded feller here and there
all nonsense
said troy angrily
there she is with plenty of money and a house and farm and horses and comfort and here am i living from hand to mouth  a needy adventurer
besides it is no use talking now it is too late and i am glad of it i've been seen and recognized here this very afternoon
i should have gone back to her the day after the fair if it hadn't been for you talking about the law and rubbish about getting a separation and i don't put it off any longer
what the deuce put it into my head to run away at all i can't think
humbugging sentiment  that's what it was
but what man on earth was to know that his wife would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name
i should have known it
she's bad enough for anything
pennyways mind who you are talking to
well sergeant all i say is this that if i were you i'd go abroad again where i came from  'tisn't too late to do it now
i wouldn't stir up the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with her  for all that about your playacting is sure to come out you know although you think otherwise
my eyes and limbs there'll be a racket if you go back just now  in the middle of bold wood's christmasing
h'm yes
i expect i shall not be a very welcome guest if he has her there
said the sergeant with a slight laugh
a sort of alonzo the brave and when i go in the guests will sit in silence and fear and all laughter and pleasure will be hushed and the lights in the chamber burn blue and the worms  ugh horrible
 ring for some more brandy pennyways i felt an awful shudder just then
well what is there besides
a sticki must have a walkingstick
pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty for should bathsheba and troy become recon ciled it would be necessary to regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her husband
i sometimes think she likes you yet and is a good woman at bottom
he said as a saving sentence
but there's no telling to a certainty from a body's outside
well you'll do as you like about going of course sergeant and as for me i'll do as you tell me
now let me see what the time is
said troy after emptying his glass in one draught as he stood
'half past six o'clock
i shall not hurry along the road and shall be there then before nine
chapter liii    concurritur  horae momento   outside the front of boldwood's house a group of men stood in the dark with their faces towards the door which occasionally opened and closed for the passage of some guest or servant when a golden rod of light would stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again leaving nothing outside but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid the evergreens over the door
he was seen in casterbridge this afternoon  so the boy said
one of them remarked in a whisper
and l for one believe it
his body was never found you know
'tis a strange story
said the next
you may depend upon't that she knows nothing about it
not a word
perhaps he don't mean that she shall
said another man
if he's alive and here in the neighbourhood he means mischief
said the first
poor young thing i do pity her if 'tis true
he'll drag her to the dogs
o no he'll settle down quiet enough
said one disposed to take a more hopeful view of the case
what a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with the man
she is so selfwilled and independent too that one is more minded to say it serves her right than pity her
no no
i don't hold with 'ee there
she was no otherwise than a girl mind and how could she tell what the man was made of
if 'tis really true 'tis too hard a punishment and more than she ought to hae
 hullo who's that
this was to some footsteps that were heard approaching
william smallbury
said a dim figure in the shades coming up and joining them
dark as a hedge to night isn't it
i all but missed the plank over the river ath'art there in the bottom  never did such a thing before in my life
be ye any of boldwood's workfolk
he peered into their faces
yes  all o' us
we met here a few minutes ago
oh i hear now  that's sam samway  thought i knowed the voice too
going in
presently
but i say william
samway whispered have ye heard this strange tale
what  that about sergeant troy being seen d'ye mean souls
said smallbury also lowering his voice
ay in casterbridge
yes i have
laban tall named a hint of it to me but now  but i don't think it
hark here laban comes himself 'a b'lieve
a footstep drew near
laban
yes 'tis i
said tall
have ye heard any more about that
no
said tall joining the group
and i'm in clined to think we'd better keep quiet
if so be 'tis not true 'twill flurry her and do her much harm to repeat it and if so be 'tis true 'twill do no good to forestall her time o' trouble
god send that it mid be a lie for though henery fray and some of 'em do speak against her she's never been anything but fair to me
she's hot and hasty but she's a brave girl who'll never tell a lie however much the truth may harm her and i've no cause to wish her evil
she never do tell women's little lies that's true and 'tis a thing that can be said of very few
ay all the harm she thinks she says to yer face there's nothing underhand wi' her
they stood silent then every man busied with his own thoughts during which interval sounds of merri ment could be heard within
then the front door again opened the rays streamed out the wellknown form of boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light the door closed and boldwood walked slowly down the path
'tis master
one of the men whispered as he neared them
we'd better stand quiet  he'll go in again directly
he would think it unseemly o' us to be loitering here
boldwood came on and passed by the men without seeing them they being under the bushes on the grass
he paused leant over the gate and breathed a long breath
they heard low words come from him
i hope to god she'll come or this night will be nothing but misery to me
o my darling my darling why do you keep me in suspense like this
he said this to himself and they all distinctly heard it
boldwood remained silent after that and the noise from indoors was again just audible until a few minutes later light wheels could be distinguished coming down the hill
they drew nearer and ceased at the gate
boldwood hastened back to the door and opened it and the light shone upon bathsheba coming up the path
boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome the men marked her light laugh and apology as she met him he took her into the house and the door closed again
gracious heaven i didn't know it was like that with him
said one of the men
i thought that fancy of his was over long ago
you don't know much of master if you thought that
said samway
i wouldn't he should know we heard what 'a said for the world
remarked a third
i wish we had told of the report at once
the first uneasily continued
more harm may come of this than we know of
poor mr boldwood it will be hard upon en
i wish troy was in      well god forgive me for such a wish
a scoundrel to play a poor wife such tricks
nothing has prospered in weatherbury since he came here
and now i've no heart to go in
let's look into warren's for a few minutes first shall us neighbours
samway tall and smallbury agreed to go to warren's and went out at the gate the remaining ones entering the house
the three soon drew near the malthouse approaching it from the adjoining orchard and not by way of the street
the pane of glass was illuminated as usual
smallbury was a little in advance of the rest when pausing he turned suddenly to his companions and said hist
see there
the light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the ivied wall as usual but upon some object close to the glass
it was a human face
let's come closer
whispered samway and they approached on tiptoe
there was no disbelieving the report any longer
troy's face was almost close to the pane and he was looking in
not only was he looking in but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation which was in progress in the malthouse the voices of the interlocutors being those of oak and the maltster
the spree is all in her honour isn't it  hey
said the old man
although he made believe 'tis only keeping up o' christmas
i cannot say
replied oak
o 'tis true enough faith
i cannot understand farmer boldwood being such a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after thik woman in the way 'a do and she not care a bit about en
the men after recognizing troy's features withdrew across the orchard as quietly as they had come
the air was big with bathsheba's fortunes tonight  every word everywhere concerned her
when they were quite out of earshot all by one instinct paused
it gave me quite a turn  his face
said tall breathing
and so it did me
said samway
what's to be done
i don't see that 'tis any business of ours
smallbury murmured dubiously
but it is
'tis a thing which is everybody's business said samway
we know very well that master's on a wrong tack and that she's quite in the dark and we should let 'em know at once
laban you know her best  you'd better go and ask to speak to her
i bain't fit for any such thing
said laban nervously
i should think william ought to do it if anybody
he's oldest
i shall have nothing to do with it
said smallbury
'tis a ticklish business altogether
why he'll go on to her himself in a few minutes ye'll see
we don't know that he will
come laban
very well if i must i must i suppose
tall reluct antly answered
what must i say
just ask to see master
o no i shan't speak to mr boldwood
if i tell anybody 'twill be mistress
very well
said samway
laban then went to the door
when he opened it the hum of bustle rolled out as a wave upon a still strand  the assemblage being immediately inside the halland was deadened to a murmur as he closed it again
each man waited intently and looked around at the dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and occasionally shivering in a slight wind as if he took interest in the scene which neither did
one of them began walking up and down and then came to where he started from and stopped again with a sense that walking was thing not worth doing now
i should think laban must have seen mistress by this time
said smallbury breaking the silence
per haps she won't come and speak to him
the door opened
tall appeared and joined them well
said both
i didn't like to ask for her after all
laban faltered out
they were all in such a stir trying to put a little spirit into the party
somehow the fun seems to hang fire though everything's there that a heart can desire and i couldn't for my soul interfere and throw damp upon it  if 'twas to save my life i couldn't
i suppose we had better all go in together
said samway gloomily
perhaps i may have a chance of saying a word to master
so the men entered the hall which was the room selected and arranged for the gathering because of its size
the younger men and maids were at last just beginning to dance
bathsheba had been perplexed how to act for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself and the weight of stateliness sat heavy upon her
sometimes she thought she ought not to have come under any circumstances then she considered what cold unkindness that would have been and finally resolved upon the middle course of staying for about an hour only and gliding off unobserved having from the first made up her mind that she could on no account dance sing or take any active part in the proceedings
her allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on bathsheba told liddy not to hurry her self and went to the small parlour to prepare for departure which like the hall was decorated with holly and ivy and well lighted up
nobody was in the room but she had hardly been there a moment when the master of the house entered
mrs
troy  you are not going
he said
we've hardly begun
if you'll excuse me i should like to go now
her manner was restive for she remembered her promise and imagined what he was about to say
but as it is not late
she added i can walk home and leave my man and liddy to come when they choose
i've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you
said boldwood
you know perhaps what i long to say
bathsheba silently looked on the floor
you do give it
he said eagerly
what
she whispered
now that's evasion
why the promise
i don't want to intrude upon you at all or to let it become known to anybody
but do give your word
a mere business compact you know between two people who are beyond the influence of passion
boldwood knew how false this picture was as regarded himself but he had proved that it was the only tone in which she would allow him to approach her
a promise to marry me at the end of five years and threequarters
you owe it to me
i feel that i do
said bathsheba that is if you demand it
but i am a changed woman  an unhappy woman  and not  not     you are still a very beautiful woman said boldwood
honesty and pure conviction suggested the remark unaccompanied by any perception that it might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her
however it had not much effect now for for she said in a passionless murmur which was in itself a proof of her words i have no feeling in the matter at all
and i don't at all know what is right to do in my diddicult position and i have nobody to advise me
but i give my promise if i must
i give it as the rendering of a debt conditionally of course on my being a widow
you'll marry me between five and six years hence
don't press me too hard
i'll marry nobody else
but surely you will name the time or there's nothing in the promise at all
o i don't know pray let me go
she said her bosom beginning to rise
i am afraid what to do
want to be just to you and to be that seems to be wrong ing myself and perhaps it is breaking the commandments
there is considerable doubt of his death and then it is dreadful let me ask a solicitor mr boldwood if i ought or no
say the words dear one and the subject shall be dismissed a blissful loving intimacy of six years and then marriage  o bathsheba say them
he begged in a husky voice unable to sustain the forms of mere friendship any longer
promise yourself to me i deserve it indeed i do for i have loved you more than anybody in the world
and if i said hasty words and showed uncalledfor heat of manner towards you believe me dear i did not mean to distress you i was in agony bathsheba and i did not know what i said
you wouldn't let a dog suffer what i have suffered could you but know it
sometimes i shrink from your knowing what i have felt for you and sometimes i am distressed that all of it you never will know
be gracious and give up a little to me when i would give up my life for you
the trimmings of her dress as they quivered against the light showed how agitated she was and at last she burst out crying
'and you'll not  press me  about anything more  if i say in five or six years
she sobbed when she had power to frame the words
yes then i'll leave it to time
very well
if he does not return i'll marry you in six years from this day if we both live
she said solemnly
and you'll take this as a token from me
boldwood had come close to her side and now he clasped one of her hands in both his own and lifted it to his breast
what is it
oh i cannot wear a ring
she ex claimed on seeing what he held besides i wouldn't have a soul know that it's an engagement
perhaps it is improper
besides we are not engaged in the usual sense are we
don't insist mr boldwood  don't
in her trouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once she stamped passionately on the floor with one foot and tears crowded to her eyes again
it means simply a pledge  no sentiment  the seal of a practical compact
he said more quietly but still retaining her hand in his firm grasp
come now
and boldwood slipped the ring on her finger
i cannot wear it
she said weeping as if her heart would break
you frighten me almost
so wild a scheme
please let me go home
only tonight  wear it just tonight to please me
bathsheba sat down in a chair and buried her face in her handkerchief though boldwood kept her hand yet
at length she said in a sort of hopeless whisper  very well then i will tonight if you wish it so earnestly
now loosen my hand i will indeed i will wear it tonight
and it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six years with a wedding at the end
it must be i suppose since you will have it so
she said fairly beaten into nonresistance
boldwood pressed her hand and allowed it to drop in her lap
i am happy now
he said
god bless you
he left the room and when he thought she might be sufficiently composed sent one of the maids to her bathsheba cloaked the effects of the late scene as she best could followed the girl and in a few moments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on ready to go
to get to the door it was necessary to pass through the hall and before doing so she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended into one corner to take a last look at the gathering
there was no music or dancing in progress just now
at the lower end which had been arranged for the work folk specially a group conversed in whispers and with clouded looks
boldwood was standing by the fireplace and he too though so absorbed in visions arising from her promise that he scarcely saw anything seemed at that moment to have observed their peculiar manner and their looks askance
what is it you are in doubt about men
he said
one of them turned and replied uneasily it was something laban heard of that's all sir
news
anybody married or engaged born or dead
inquired the farmer gaily
tell it to us tall
one would think from your looks and mysterious ways that it was something very dreadful indeed
o no sir nobody is dead
said tall
i wish somebody was
said samway in a whisper
what do you say samway
asked boldwood some what sharply
if you have anything to say speak out if not get up another dance
mrs
troy has come downstairs
said samway to tall
if you want to tell her you had better do it now
do you know what they mean
the farmer asked bathsheba across the room
i don't in the least said bathsheba
there was a smart rapping at the door
one of the men opened it instantly and went outside
mrs
troy is wanted
he said on returning
quite ready
said bathsheba
though i didn't tell them to send
it is a stranger ma'am
said the man by the door
a stranger
she said
ask him to come in
said boldwood
the message was given and troy wrapped up to his eyes as we have seen him stood in the doorway
there was an unearthly silence all looking towards the newcomer
those who had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized him instantly those who did not were perplexed
nobody noted bathsheba
she was leaning on the stairs
her brow had heavily contracted her whole face was pallid her lips apart her eyes rigidly staring at their visitor
boldwood was among those who did not notice that he was troy
come in come in
he repeated cheerfully and drain a christmas beaker with us stranger
troy next advanced into the middle of the room took off his cap turned down his coatcollar and looked boldwood in the face
even then boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of heaven's persistent irony towards him who had once before broken in upon his bliss scourged him and snatched his delight away had come to do these things a second time
troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh boldwood recognized him now
troy turned to bathsheba
the poor girl's wretched ness at this time was beyond all fancy or narration
she had sunk down on the lowest stair and there she sat her mouth blue and dry and her dark eyes fixed vacantly upon him as if she wondered whether it were not all a terrible illusion
then troy spoke
bathsheba i come here for you
she made no reply
come home with me come
bathsheba moved her feet a little but did not rise
troy went across to her
come madam do you hear what i say
he said peremptorily
a strange voice came from the fireplace  a voice sounding far off and confined as if from a dungeon
hardly a soul in the assembly recognized the thin tones to be those of boldwood
sudden dispaire had trans formed him
bathsheba go with your husband
nevertheless she did not move
the truth was that bathsheba was beyond the pale of activity  and yet not in a swoon
she was in a state of mental gutta serena her mind was for the minute totally deprived of light at the same time no obscuration was apparent from without
troy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him when she quickly shrank back
this visible dread of him seemed to irritate troy and he seized her arm and pulled it sharply
whether his grasp pinched her or whether his mere touch was the 'cause was never known but at the moment of his seizure she writhed and gave a quick low scream
the scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by sudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied them all
the oak partition shook with the concussion and the place was filled with grey smoke
in bewilderment they turned their eyes to boldwood
at his back as stood before the fireplace was a gun rack as is usual in farmhouses constructed to hold two guns
when bathsheba had cried out in her husband's grasp boldwood's face of gnashing despair had changed
the veins had swollen and a frenzied look had gleamed in his eye
he had turned quickly taken one of the guns cocked it and at once discharged it at troy
troy fell
the distance apart of the two men was so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the least but passed like a bullet into his body
he uttered a long guttural sigh  there was a contraction  an exten sion  then his muscles relaxed and he lay still
boldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the gun
it was doublebarrelled and he had meanwhile in some way fastened his hand kerchief to the trigger and with his foot on the other end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself
samway his man was the first to see this and in the midst of the general horror darted up to him
boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief and the gun exploded a second time sending its contents by a timely blow from samway into the beam which crossed the ceiling
well it makes no difference
boldwood gasped
there is another way for me to die
then he broke from samway crossed the room to bathsheba and kissed her hand
he put on his hat opened the door and went into the darkness nobody thinking of preventing him
chapter liv    after the shock   boldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of casterbridge
here he walked at an even steady pace over yalbury hill along the dead level beyond mounted mellstock hill and between eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the moor into the town
the streets were nearly deserted now and the waving lampflames only lighted up rows of grey shopshutters and strips of white paving upon which his step echoed as his passed along
he turned to the right and halted before an archway of heavy stonework which was closed by an iron studded pair of doors
this was the entrance to the gaol and over it a lamp was fixed the light en abling the wretched traveller to find a bellpull
the small wicket at last opened and a porter appeared
boldwood stepped forward and said some thing in a low tone when after a delay another man came
boldwood entered and the door was closed behind him and he walked the world no more
long before this time weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused and the wild deed which had ter minated boldwood's merrymaking became known to all
of those out of the house oak was one of the first to hear of the catastrophe and when he entered the room which was about five minutes after boldwood's exit the scene was terrible
all the female guests were huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm and the men were bewildered as to what to do
as for bathsheba she had changed
she was sitting on the floor beside the body of troy his head pillowed in her lap where she had herself lifted it
with one hand she held her handkerchief to his breast and covered the wound though scarcely a single drop of blood had flowed and with the other she tightly clasped one of his
the household convulsion had made her herself again
the temporary coma had ceased and activity had come with the necessity for it
deeds of endur ance which seem ordinary in philosophy are rare in conduct and bathsheba was astonishing all around her now for her philosophy was her conduct and she seldom thought practicable what she did not practise
she was of the stuff of which great men's mothers are made
she was indispensable to high generation hated at tea parties feared in shops and loved at crises
troy recumbent in his wife's lap formed now the sole spectacle in the middle of the spacious room
gabriel
she said automatically when he entered turning up a face of which only the wellknown lines remained to tell him it was hers all else in the picture having faded quite
ride to casterbridge instantly for a surgeon
it is i believe useless but go
mr boldwood has shot my husband
her statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with more force than a tragic declamation and had somewhat the effect of setting the distorted images in each mind present into proper focus
oak almost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest abstract of the event hurried out of the room saddled a horse and rode away
not till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to him that he would have done better by sending some other man on this errand remaining himself in the house
what had become of boldwood
he should have been looked after
was he mad  had there been a quarrel
then how had troy got there
where had he come from
how did this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed by many to be at the bottom of the sea
oak had in some slight measure been prepared for the presence of troy by hearing a rumour of his return just before entering boldwood's house but before he had weighed that information this fatal event had been superimposed
however it was too late now to think of sending another messenger and he rode on in the excitement of these selfinquiries not discerning when about three miles from caster bridge a squarefigured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge in the same direction as his own
the miles necessary to be traversed and other hindrances incidental to the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night delayed the arrival of mr aldritch the surgeon and more than three hours passed between the time at which the shot was fired and that of his entering the house
oak was addition ally detained in casterbridge through having to give notice to the authorities of what had happened and he then found that boldwood had also entered the town and delivered himself up
in the meantime the surgeon having hastened into the hall at boldwood's found it in darkness and quite deserted
he went on to the back of the house where he discovered in the kitchen an old man of whom he made inquiries
she's had him took away to her own house sir said his informant
who has
said the doctor
mrs
troy
'a was quite dead sir
this was astonishing information
she had no right to do that
said the doctor
there will have to be an inquest and she should have waited to know what to do
yes sir it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law was known
but she said law was nothing to her and she wouldn't let her dear husband's corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all the crowners in england
mr aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to bathsheba's
the first person he met was poor liddy who seemed literally to have dwindled smaller in these few latter hours
what has been done
he said
i don't know sir
said liddy with suspended breath
my mistress has done it all
where is she
upstairs with him sir
when he was brought home and taken upstairs she said she wanted no further help from the men
and then she called me and made me fill the bath and after that told me i had better go and lie down because i looked so ill then she locked herself into the room alone with him and would not let a nurse come in or anybody at all
but i thought i'd wait in the next room in case she should want me
i heard her moving about inside for more than an  hour but she only came out once and that was for more candles because hers had burnt down into the socket
she said we were to let her know when you or mr thirdly came sir
oak entered with the parson at this moment and they all went upstairs together preceded by liddy smallbury
everything was silent as the grave when they paused on the landing
liddy knocked and bathsheba's dress was heard rustling across the room the key turned in the lock and she opened the door
her looks were calm and nearly rigid like a slightly animated bust of melpomene
oh mr aldritch you have come at last
she murmured from her lips merely and threw back the door
ah and mr thirdly
well all is done and anybody in the world may see him now
she then passed by him crossed the landing and entered another room
looking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the light of the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight shape lying at the further end of the bedroom wrapped in white
everything around was quite orderly
the doctor went in and after a few minutes returned to the landing again where oak and the parson still waited
it is all done indeed as she says
remarked mr aldritch in a subdued voice
the body has been undressed and properly laid out in grave clothes
gracious heaven  this mere girl
she must have the nerve of a stoic
the heart of a wife merely
floated in a whisper about the ears of the three and turning they saw bathsheba in the midst of them
then as if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been more of will than of spontaneity she silently sank down between them and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor
the simple consciousness that superhuman strain was no longer required had at once put a period to her power to continue it
they took her away into a further room and the medical attendance which had been useless in troy's case was invaluable in bathsheba's who fell into a series of faintingfits that had a serious aspect for a time
the sufferer was got to bed and oak finding from the bulletins that nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her score left the house
liddy kept watch in bathsheba's chamber where she heard her mistress moaning in whispers through the dull slow hours of that wretched night o it is my fault   how can i live
o heaven how can i live
chapter lv    the march following  bathsheba boldwood   we pass rapidly on into the month of march to a breezy day without sunshine frost or dew
on yai bury hill about midway between weatherbury and casterbridge where the turnpike road passes over the crest a numerous concourse of people had gathered the eyes of the greater number being fre quently stretched afar in a northerly direction
the groups consisted of a throng of idlers a party of javelinmen and two trumpeters and in the midst were carriages one of which contained the high sheriff
with the idlers many of whom had mounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road were several weatherbury men and boys  among others poorgrass coggan and cain ball
at the end of halfanhour a faint dust was seen in the expected quarter and shortly after a travelling carriage bringing one of the two judges on the western circuit came up the hill and halted on the top
the judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the bigcheeked trumpeters and a procession being formed of the vehicles and javelinmen they all pro ceeded towards the town excepting the weatherbury men who as soon as they had seen the judge move off returned home again to their work
joseph i seed you squeezing close to the carriage said coggan as they walked
did ye notice my lord judge's face
i did
said poorgrass
i looked hard at en as if i would read his very soul and there was mercy in his eyes  or to speak with the exact truth required of us at this solemn time in the eye that was towards me
well i hope for the best
said coggan though bad that must be
however i shan't go to the trial and i'd advise the rest of ye that bain't wanted to bide away
'twill disturb his  mind more than anything to see us there staring at him as if he were a show
the very thing i said this morning
observed joseph justice is come to weigh him in the balances i said in my reflectious way and if he's found wanting so be it unto him and a bystander said hear hear a man who can talk like that ought to be heard
but i don't like dwelling upon it for my few words are my few words and not much though the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature formed for such
so 'tis joseph
and now neighbours as i said every man bide at home
the resolution was adhered to and all waited anxiously for the news next day
their suspense was diverted however by a discovery which was made in the afternoon throwing more light on boldwood's conduct and condition than any details which had preceded it
that he had been from the time of greenhill fair until the fatal christmas eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had been intimate with him but nobody imagined that there had shown in him unequivocal symptoms of the mental derange ment which bathsheba and oak alone of all others and at different times had momentarily suspected
in a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary collection of articles
there were several sets of ladies dresses in the piece of sundry expensive materials silks and satins poplins and velvets all of colours which from bathsheba's style of dress might have been judged to be her favourites
there were two muffs sable and ermine
above all there was a case of jewellery containing four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings all of fine quality and manu facture
these things had been bought in bath and other towns from time to time and brought home by stealth
they were all carefully packed in paper and each package was labelled  bathsheba boldwood
a date being subjoined six years in advance in every instance
these somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love were the subject of discourse in warren's malthouse when oak entered from caster bridge with tidings of the kiln glow shone upon it told the tale sufficiently well
boldwood as every one supposed he would do had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced to death
the conviction that boldwood had not been morally responsible for his later acts now became general
facts elicited previous to the trial had pointed strongly in the same direction but they had not been of sufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the state of boldwood's mind
it was astonishing now that a presumption of insanity was raised how many collateral circumstances were remembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford the only explanation   among others the unprecedented neglect of his corn stacks in the previous summer
a petition was addressed to the home secretary advancing the circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a reconsideration of the sentence
it was not numerously signed by the inhabitants of caster bridge as is usual in such cases for boldwood had never made many friends over the counter
the shops thought it very natural that a man who by importing direct from the producer had daringly set aside the first great principle of provincial existence namely that god made country villages to supply customers to county towns should have confused ideas about the decalogue
the prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed and the result was that evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view out of the category of wilful murder and lead it to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness
the upshot of the petition was waited for in weather bury with solicitous interest
the execution had been fixed for eight o'clock on a saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed and up to friday afternoon no answer had been received
at that time gabriel came from casterbridge gaol whither he had been to wish boldwood goodbye and turned down a bystreet to avoid the town
when past the last house he heard a hammering and lifting his bowed head he looked back for a moment
over the chimneys he could see the upper part of the gaol entrance rich and glowing in the afternoon sun and some moving figures were there
they were carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the parapet
he with drew his eyes quickly and hastened on
it was dark when he reached home and half the village was out to meet him
no tidings
gabriel said wearily
and i'm afraid there's no hope
i've been with him more than two hours
do ye think he really was out of his mind when he did it
said smallbury
i can't honestly say that i do
oak replied
how ever that we can talk of another time
has there been any change in mistress this afternoon
none at all
is she downstairs
no
and getting on so nicely as she was too
she's but very little better now again than she was at christmas
she keeps on asking if you be come and if there's news till one's wearied out wi' answering her
shall i go and say you've come
no
said oak
there's a chance yet but i couldn't stay in town any longer  after seeing him too so laban  laban is here isn't he
yes
said tall
what i've arranged is that you shall ride to town the last thing tonight leave here about nine and wait a while there getting home about twelve
if nothing has been received by eleven tonight they say there's no chance at all
i do so hope his life will be spared
said liddy
if it is not she'll go out of her mind too
poor thing her sufferings have been dreadful she deserves any body's pity
is she altered much
said coggan
if you haven't seen poor mistress since christmas you wouldn't know her
said liddy
her eyes are so miserable that she's not the same woman
only two years ago she was a romping girl and now she's this
laban departed as directed and at eleven o'clock that night  several of the villagers strolled along the road to casterbridge and awaited his arrivalamong them oak and nearly all the rest of bathsheba's men
gabriel's anxiety was great that boldwood might be saved even though in his conscience he felt that he ought to die for there had been qualities in the farmer which oak loved
at last when they all were weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance  first dead as if on turf it trode then clattering  on the village road in other pace than forth he yode
we shall soon know now one way or other
said coggan and they all stepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the road and the rider pranced into the midst of them
is that you laban
said gabriel
yes  'tis come
he's not to die
'tis confine ment during her majesty's pleasure
hurrah
said coggan with a swelling heart
god's above the devil yet
chapter lvi    beauty in loneliness  after all   bathsheba revived with the spring
the utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all un certainty upon every subject had come to an end
but she remained alone now for the greater part of her time and stayed in the house or at furthest went into the garden
she shunned every one even liddy and could be brought to make no confidences and to ask for no sympathy
as the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air and began to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity though she never rode out or personally superintended as at former times
one friday evening in august she walked a little way along the road and entered the village for the first time since the sombre event of the preceding christmas
none of the old colour had as yet come to her cheek and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black of her gown till it appeared preternatural
when she reached a little shop at the other end of the place which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard bath sheba heard singing inside the church and she knew that the singers were practising
she crossed the road opened the gate and entered the graveyard the high sills of the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of those gathered within
her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein troy had worked at planting flowers upon fanny robin's grave and she came to the marble tombstone
a motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete inscription
first came the words of troy himself  erected by francis troy in beloved memory of fanny robin who died october     aged  years
underneath this was now inscribed in new letters  in the same grave lie the remains of the aforesaid francis troy who died december th    whilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ began again in the church and she went with the same light step round to the porch and listened
the door was closed and the choir was learning a new hymn
bathsheba was stirred by emotions which latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within her
the little attenuated voices of the children brought to her ear in destinct utterance the words they sang without thought or comprehension  lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom lead thou me on
bathsheba's feeling was always to some extent de pendent upon her whim as is the case with many other women
something big came into her throat and an uprising to her eyes  and she thought that she would allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished
they did flow and plenteously and one fell upon the stone bench beside her
once that she had begun to cry for she hardly knew what she could not leave off for crowd ing thoughts she knew too well
she would have given anything in the world to be as those children were un concerned at the meaning of their words because too innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression
all the impassioned scenes of her brief expenence seemed to revive with added emotion at that moment and those scenes which had been without emotion during enactment had emotion then
yet grief came to her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former times
owing to bathsheba's face being buried in her hands she did not notice a form which came quietly into the porch and on seeing her first moved as if to retreat then paused and regarded her
bathsheba did not raise her head for some time and when she looked round her face was wet and her eyes drowned and dim
mr
oak
exclaimed she disconcerted  how long have you been here
a few minutes ma'am
said oak respectfully
are you going in
said bathsheba and there came from within the church as from a prompter  l loved the garish day and spite of fears pride ruled my will remember not past years
i was
said gabriel
i am one of the bass singers you know
i have sung bass for several months
indeed i wasn't aware of that
i'll leave you then
which i have loved long since and lost awhile sang the children
don't let me drive you away mistress
i think i won't go in tonight
o no  you don't drive me away
then they stood in a state of some embarrassment bathsheba trying to wipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing her
at length oak said i've not seen youi mean spoken to you  since ever so long have i
but he feared to bring distress ing memories back and interrupted himself with were you going into church
no
she said
i came to see the tombstone privately  to see if they had cut the inscription as i wished mr oak you needn't mind speaking to me if you wish to on the matter which is in both our minds at this moment
and have they done it as you wished
said oak
yes
come and see it if you have not already
so together they went and read the tomb
eight months ago
gabriel murmured when he saw the date
it seems like yesterday to me
and to me as if it were years agolong years and i had been dead between
and now i am going home mr
oak
oak walked after her
i wanted to name a small matter to you as soon as i could
he said with hesitation
merrily about business and i think i may just mention it now if you'll allow me
o yes certainly
it is that i may soon have to give up the manage ment of your farm mrs
troy
the fact is i am think ing of leaving england  not yet you know  next spring 
leaving england
she said in surprise and genuine disappointment
why gabriel what are you going to do that for
well i've thought it best
oak stammered out
california is the spot i've had in my mind to try
but it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor mr boldwood's farm on your own account
i've had the refusal o' it 'tis true but nothing is settled yet and i have reasons for giving up
i shall finish out my year there as manager for the trustees but no more
and what shall i do without you
oh gabriel i don't think you ought to go away
you've been with me so long  through bright times and dark times  such old friends that as we are  that it seems unkind almost
i had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master you might still give a helping look across at mine
and now going away
i would have willingly
yet now that i am more helpless than ever you go away
yes that's the ill fortune o' it
said gabriel in a distressed tone
and it is because of that very help lessness that i feel bound to go
good afternoon ma'am he concluded in evident anxiety to get away and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could follow on no pretence whatever
bathsheba went home her mind occupied with a new trouble which being rather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by diverting her from the chronic gloom of her life
she was set thinking a great deal about oak and of his which to shun her and there occurred to bathsheba several incidents of latter in tercourse with him which trivial when singly viewed amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for her society
it broke upon her at length as a great pain that her last old disciple was about to forsake her and flee
he who had believed in her and argued on her side when all the rest of the world was against her had at last like the others become weary and neglectful of the old cause and was leaving her to fight her battles alone
three weeks went on and more evidence of his want of interest in her was forthcoming
she noticed that instead of entering the small parlour or office where the farm accounts were kept and waiting or leaving a memorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion oak never came at all when she was likely to be there only entering at unseasonable hours when her presence in that part of the house was least to be expected
whenever he wanted directions he sent a message or note with neither heading nor signature to which she was obliged to reply in the same offhand style
poor bathsheba began to suffer now from the most torturing sting of alia sensation that she was despised
the autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy conjectures and christmasday came com pleting a year of her legal widowhood and two years and a quarter of her life alone
on examining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the sub ject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive  the event in the hall at boldwood's  was not agitating her at all but instead an agonizing con viction that everybody abjured her  for what she could not tell  and that oak was the ringleader of the recusants
coming out of church that day she looked round in hope that oak whose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead in a most unconcerned manner might chance to linger in her path in the old way
there he was as usual coming down the path behind her
but on seeing bathsheba turn he looked aside and as soon as he got beyond the gate and there was the barest excuse for a divergence he made one and vanished
the next morning brought the culminating stroke she had been expecting it long
it was a formal notice by letter from him that he should not renew his engage ment with her for the following ladyday
bathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly
she was aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from gabriel which she had after all grown to regard as her inalienable right for life should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way
she was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her own resources again it seemed to herself that she never could again acquire energy sufficient to go to market barter and sell
since troy's death oak had attended all sales and fairs for her transacting her business at the same time with his own
what should she do now
her life was becoming a desolation
so desolate was bathsheba this evening that in an absolute hunger for pity and sympathy and miserable in that she appeared to have outlived the only true friend ship she had ever owned she put on her bonnet and cloak and went down to oak's house just after sunset guided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few days old
a lively firelight shone from the window but nobody was visible in the room
she tapped nervously and then thought it doubtful if it were right for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone although he was her manager and she might be supposed to call on business without any real impropriety
gabriel opened the door and the moon shone upon his fore haad
mr
oak
said bathsheba faintly
yes i am mr
oak
said gabriel
who have i the honour  o how stupid of me not to know you mistress
i shall not be your mistress much longer shall i gabriel
she said in pathetic tones
well no
i suppose  but come in ma'am
oh  and i'll get a light
oak replied with some awkwardness
no not on my account
it is so seldom that i get a lady visitor that i'm afraid i haven't proper accommodation
will you sit down please
here's a chair and there's one too
i am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats and are rather hard but i was thinking of getting some new ones
oak placed two or three for her
they are quite easy enough for me
so down she sat and down sat he the fire dancing in their faces and upon the old furniture all asheenen wi' long years o' handlen that formed oak's array of household possessions which sent back a dancing reflection in reply
it was very odd to these two persons who knew each other passing well that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward and constrained
in the fields or at her house there had never been any embarrassment but now that oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be moved back again to the days when they were strangers
you'll think it strange that i have come but   o no not at all
but i thought  gabriel i have been uneasy in the belief that i have offended you and that you are going away on that account
it grieved me very much and i couldn't help coming
offended me
as if you could do that bathsheba
haven't i
she asked gladly
but what are you going away for else
i am not going to emigrate you know i wasn't aware that you would wish me not to when i told 'ee or i shouldn't ha' thought of doing it
he said simply
i have arranged for little weatherbury farm and shall have it in my own hands at ladyday
you know i've had a share in it for some time
still that wouldn't prevent my attending to your business as before hadn't it been that things have been said about us
what
said bathsheba in surprise
things said about you and me
what are they
i cannot tell you
it would be wiser if you were to i think
you have played the part of mentor to me many times and i don't see why you should fear to do it now
it is nothing that you have done this time
the top and tail o't is this  that i am sniffing about here and waiting for poor boldwood's farm with a thought of getting you some day
getting me
what does that mean
marrying o' 'ee in plain british
you asked me to tell so you mustn't blame me
bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been discharged by her ear which was what oak had expected
marrying me
i didn't know it was that you meant
she said quietly
such a thing as that is too absurd  too soon  to think of by far
yes of course it is too absurd
i don't desire any such thing i should think that was plain enough by this time
surely surely you be the last person in the world i think of marrying
it is too absurd as you say too  sssoon were the words i used
i must beg your pardon for correcting you but you said too absurd and so do i
i beg your pardon too
she returned with tears in her eyes
too soon was what i said
but it doesn't matter a bit  not at alibut i only meant too soon indeed i didn't mr oak and you must believe me
gabriel looked her long in the face but the firelight being faint there was not much to be seen
bathsheba he said tenderly and in surprise and coming closer if i only knew one thing  whether you would allow me to love you and win you and marry you after aliif i only knew that
but you never will know
she murmured
why
because you never ask
oh  oh
said gabriel with a low laugh of joyous ness
my own dear   you ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning
she interrupted
it shows you didn't care a bit about me and were ready to desert me like all the rest of them
it was very cruel of you consider ing i was the first sweetheart that you ever had and you were the first i ever had and i shall not forget it
now bathsheba was ever anybody so provoking he said laughing
you know it was purely that i as an unmarried man carrying on a business for you as a very taking young woman had a proper hard part to play  more particular that people knew i had a sort of feeling for'ee and i fancied from the way we were mentioned together that it might injure your good name
nobody knows the heat and fret i have been caused by it
and was that all
all
oh how glad i am i came
she exclaimed thank fully as she rose from her seat
i have thought so much more of you since i fancied you did not want even to see me again
but i must be going now or i shall be missed
why gabriel
she said with a slight laugh as they went to the door it seems exactly as if i had come courting you  how dreadful
and quite right too
said oak
i've danced at your skittish heels my beautiful bathsheba for many a long mile and many a long day and it is hard to be grudge me this one visit
he accompanied her up the hill explaining to her the details of his forthcoming tenure of the other farm
they spoke very little of their mutual  feeling pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably un necessary between such tried friends
theirs was that substantial affection which arises if any arises at all when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other's character and not the best till further on the romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality
this goodfellowship  camaraderie   usually occurring through similarity of pursuits is unfortunately seldom superadded to love between the sexes because men and women associate not in their labours but in their pleasures merely
where however happy circumstance permits its development the compounded feeling proves itself to be the only love which is strong as death  that love which many waters cannot quench nor the floods drown beside which the passion usually called by the name is evanescent as steam
chapter lvii    a foggy night and morning  conclusion   the most private secret plainest wedding that it is possible to have
those had been bathsheba's words to oak one evening some time after the event of the preceding chapter and he meditated a full hour by the clock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter
a licence  o yes it must be a licence
he said to himself at last
very well then first a license
on a dark night a few days later oak came with mysterious steps from the surrogate's door in caster bridge
on the way home he heard a heavy tread in front of him and overtaking the man found him to be coggan
they walked together into the village until they came to a little lane behind the church leading down to the cottage of laban tall who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish and was yet in mortal terror at church on sundays when he heard his lone voice among certain hard words of the psalms whither no man ventured to follow him
well goodnight coggan
said oak i'm going down this way
oh
said coggan surprised what's going on to night then make so bold mr
oak
it seemed rather ungenerous not to tell coggan under the circumstances for coggan had been true as steel all through the time of gabriel's unhappiness about bathsheba and gabriel said  you can keep a secret coggan
you've proved me and you know
yes i have and i do know
well then mistress and i mean to get married tomorrow morning
heaven's high tower
and yet i've thought of such a thing from time to time true i have
but keeping it so close
well there 'tis no consarn of amine and i wish 'ee joy o' her
thank you coggan
but i assure 'ee that this great hush is not what i wished for at all or what either of us would have wished if it hadn't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the thing
bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shall not be in church looking at her  she's shylike and nervous about it in fact  so i be doing this to humour her
ay i see quite right too i suppose i must say
and you be now going down to the clerk
yes you may as well come with me
i am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away
said coggan as they walked along
labe tall's old woman will horn it all over parish in halfanhour 
so she will upon my life i never thought of that
said oak pausing
yet i must tell him to night i suppose for he's working so far off and leaves early
i'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her
said coggan
i'll knock and ask to speak to laban outside the door you standing in the background
then he'll come out and you can tell yer tale
she'll never guess what i want en for and i'll make up a few words about the farmwork as a blind
this scheme was considered feasible and coggan advanced boldly and rapped at mrs
tall's door
mrs
tall herself opened it
i wanted to have a word with laban
he's not at home and won't be this side of eleven o'clock
he've been forced to go over to yalbury since shutting out work
i shall do quite as well
i hardly think you will
stop a moment and coggan stepped round the corner of the porch to consult oak
who's t'other man then
said mrs
tall
only a friend
said coggan
say he's wanted to meet mistress near churchhatch tomorrow morning at ten
said oak in a whisper
that he must come without fail and wear his best clothes
the clothes will floor us as safe as houses
said coggan
it can't be helped said oak
tell her
so coggan delivered the message
mind het or wet blow or snow he must come added jan 'tis very particular indeed
the fact is 'tis to witness her sign some lawwork about taking shares wi' another farmer for a long span o' years
there that's what 'tis and now i've told 'ee mother tall in a way i shouldn't ha' done if i hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless well
coggan retired before she could ask any further and next they called at the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all
then gabriel went home and prepared for the morrow
liddy
said bathsheba on going to bed that night i want you to call me at seven o'clock tomorrow in case i shouldn't wake
but you always do wake afore then ma'am
yes but i have something important to do which i'll tell you of when the time comes and it's best to make sure
conclusion bathsheba however awoke voluntarily at four nor could she by any contrivance get to sleep again
about six being quite positive that her watch had stopped during the night she could wait no longer
she went and tapped at liddy's door and after some labour awoke her
but i thought it was i who had to call you
said the bewildered liddy
and it isn't six yet
indeed it is how can you tell such a story liddy
i know it must be ever so much past seven
come to my room as soon as you can i want you to give my hair a good brushing
when liddy came to bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting
liddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness
whatever is going on ma'am
she said
well i'll tell you
said bathsheba with a mischiev ous smile in her bright eyes
farmer oak is coming here to dine with me today
farmer oak  and nobody else
 you two alone
yes
but is it safe ma'am after what's been said
asked her companion dubiously
a woman's good name is such a perishable article that     bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek and whispered in liddy's ear although there was nobody present
then liddy stared and exclaimed  souls alive what news
it makes my heart go quite bumpitybump it makes mine rather furious too
said bathsheba
however there's no getting out of it now
it was a damp disagreeable morning
nevertheless at twenty minutes to ten o'clock oak came out of his house and went up the hill side with that sort of stride a man puts out when walking in search of a bride and knocked bathsheba's door
ten minutes later a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door and through the mist along the road to the church
the distance was not more than a quarter of a mile and these two sensible persons deemed it unnecessary to drive
an observer must have been very close indeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of oak and bathsheba armin arm for the first time in their lives oak in a greatcoat extending to his knees and bathsheba in a cloak that reached her clogs
yet though so plainly dressed there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her     as though a rose should shut and be a bud again
repose had again incarnadined her cheeks and having at gabriel's request arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on norcombe hill she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating dream which considering that she was now only three or fourandtwenty was perhaps not very wonderful
in the church were tall liddy and the parson and in a remarkably short space of time the deed was done
the two sat down very quietly to tea in bathsheba's parlour in the evening of the same day for it had been arranged that farmer oak should go there to live since he had as yet neither money house nor furniture worthy of the name though he was on a sure way towards them whilst bathsheba was comparatively in a plethora of all three
just as bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of trumpets in the front of the house
there
said oak laughing i knew those fellows were up to something by the look on their face  oak took up the light and went into the porch followed by bathsheba with a shawl over her head
the rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the gravel in front who when they saw the newlymarried couple in the porch set up a loud hurrah
and at the same moment bang again went the cannon in the background followed by a hideous clang of music from a drum tambourine clarionet serpent hautboy tenor viol and doublebass  the only remaining relics of the true and original weatherbury band  venerable worm eaten instruments which had celebrated in their own persons the victories of marlhorough under the fingers of the forefathers of those who played them now
the performers came forward and marched up to the front
those bright boys mark clark and jan are at the bottom of all this
said oak
come in souls and have something to eat and drink wi' me and my wife
not tonight
said mr clark with evident self denial
thank ye all the same but we'll call at a more seemly time
however we couldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration of some sort
if ye could send a drop of som'at down to warren's why so it is
here's long life and happiness to neighbour oak and his comely bride
thank ye thank ye all
said gabriel
a bit and a drop shall be sent to warren's for ye at once
i had a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some sort from our old friends and i was saying so to my wife but now
faith
said coggan in a critical tone turning to his companions the man hev learnt to say my wife in a wonderful naterel way considering how very youth ful he is in wedlock as yet  hey neighbours all
i never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years standing pipe my wife in a more used note than 'a did
said jacob smallbury
it might have been a little more true to nater if't had been spoke a little chillier but that wasn't to be expected just now
that improvement will come wi' time
said jan twirling his eye
then oak laughed and bathsheba smiled for she never laughed readily now and their friends turned to go
yes i suppose that's the size o't
said joseph poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away and i wish him joy o' her though i were once or twice upon saying today with holy hosea in my scripture manner which is my second nature
ephraim is joined to idols let him alone
but since 'tis as 'tis why it might have been worse and i feel my thanks accordingly
the end
phase the first the maiden   i   on an evening in the latter part of may a middleaged man was walking homeward from shaston to the village of marlott in the adjoining vale of blakemore or blackmoor
the pair of legs that carried him were rickety and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line
he occasionally gave a smart nod as if in confirmation of some opinion though he was not thinking of anything in particular
an empty eggbasket was slung upon his arm the nap of his hat was ruffled a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off
presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare who as he rode hummed a wandering tune
good night t'ee said the man with the basket
good night sir john said the parson
the pedestrian after another pace or two halted and turned round
now sir begging your pardon we met last marketday on this road about this time and i said 'good night' and you made reply 'good night sir john' as now
i did said the parson
and once before thatnear a month ago
i may have
then what might your meaning be in calling me 'sir john' these different times when i be plain jack durbeyfield the haggler
the parson rode a step or two nearer
it was only my whim he said and after a moment's hesitation it was on account of a discovery i made some little time ago whilst i was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history
i am parson tringham the antiquary of stagfoot lane
don't you really know durbeyfield that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d'urbervilles who derive their descent from sir pagan d'urberville that renowned knight who came from normandy with william the conqueror as appears by battle abbey roll
never heard it before sir
well it's true
throw up your chin a moment so that i may catch the profile of your face better
yes that's the d'urberville nose and china little debased
your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the lord of estremavilla in normandy in his conquest of glamorganshire
branches of your family held manors over all this part of england their names appear in the pipe rolls in the time of king stephen
in the reign of king john one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the knights hospitallers and in edward the second's time your forefather brian was summoned to westminster to attend the great council there
you declined a little in oliver cromwell's time but to no serious extent and in charles the second's reign you were made knights of the royal oak for your loyalty
aye there have been generations of sir johns among you and if knighthood were hereditary like a baronetcy as it practically was in old times when men were knighted from father to son you would be sir john now
ye don't say so
in short concluded the parson decisively smacking his leg with his switch there's hardly such another family in england
daze my eyes and isn't there
said durbeyfield
and here have i been knocking about year after year from pillar to post as if i was no more than the commonest feller in the parish  and how long hev this news about me been knowed pa'son tringham
the clergyman explained that as far as he was aware it had quite died out of knowledge and could hardly be said to be known at all
his own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d'urberville family he had observed durbeyfield's name on his waggon and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject
at first i resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information said he
however our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes
i thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while
well i have heard once or twice 'tis true that my family had seen better days afore they came to blackmoor
but i took no notice o't thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one
i've got a wold silver spoon and a wold graven seal at home too but lord what's a spoon and seal
  and to think that i and these noble d'urbervilles were one flesh all the time
'twas said that my gr'tgranfer had secrets and didn't care to talk of where he came from  and where do we raise our smoke now parson if i may make so bold i mean where do we d'urbervilles live
you don't live anywhere
you are extinctas a county family
that's bad
yeswhat the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male linethat is gone downgone under
then where do we lie
at kingsberesubgreenhill rows and rows of you in your vaults with your effigies under purbeckmarble canopies
and where be our family mansions and estates
you haven't any
oh
no lands neither
none though you once had 'em in abundance as i said for you family consisted of numerous branches
in this county there was a seat of yours at kingsbere and another at sherton and another in millpond and another at lullstead and another at wellbridge
and shall we ever come into our own again
ahthat i can't tell
and what had i better do about it sir
asked durbeyfield after a pause
ohnothing nothing except chasten yourself with the thought of 'how are the mighty fallen'
it is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist nothing more
there are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre
good night
but you'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi' me on the strength o't pa'son tringham
there's a very pretty brew in tap at the pure dropthough to be sure not so good as at rolliver's
no thank younot this evening durbeyfield
you've had enough already
concluding thus the parson rode on his way with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore
when he was gone durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside depositing his basket before him
in a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by durbeyfield
the latter on seeing him held up his hand and the lad quickened his pace and came near
boy take up that basket
i want 'ee to go on an errand for me
the lathlike stripling frowned
who be you then john durbeyfield to order me about and call me 'boy'
you know my name as well as i know yours
do you do you
that's the secretthat's the secret
now obey my orders and take the message i'm going to charge 'ee wi'  well fred i don't mind telling you that the secret is that i'm one of a noble raceit has been just found out by me this present afternoon pm  and as he made the announcement durbeyfield declining from his sitting position luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies
the lad stood before durbeyfield and contemplated his length from crown to toe
sir john d'urbervillethat's who i am continued the prostrate man
that is if knights were baronetswhich they be
'tis recorded in history all about me
dost know of such a place lad as kingsberesubgreenhill
ees
i've been there to greenhill fair
well under the church of that city there lie  'tisn't a city the place i mean leastwise 'twaddn' when i was there'twas a little oneeyed blinking sort o' place
never you mind the place boy that's not the question before us
under the church of that there parish lie my ancestorshundreds of 'emin coats of mail and jewels in gr't lead coffins weighing tons and tons
there's not a man in the county o' southwessex that's got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than i
oh
now take up that basket and goo on to marlott and when you've come to the pure drop inn tell 'em to send a horse and carriage to me immed'ately to carry me hwome
and in the bottom o' the carriage they be to put a noggin o' rum in a small bottle and chalk it up to my account
and when you've done that goo on to my house with the basket and tell my wife to put away that washing because she needn't finish it and wait till i come hwome as i've news to tell her
as the lad stood in a dubious attitude durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket and produced a shilling one of the chronically few that he possessed
here's for your labour lad
this made a difference in the young man's estimate of the position
yes sir john
thank 'ee
anything else i can do for 'ee sir john
tell 'em at hwome that i should like for supperwell lamb's fry if they can get it and if they can't blackpot and if they can't get that well chitterlings will do
yes sir john
the boy took up the basket and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village
what's that
said durbeyfield
not on account o' i
'tis the women's clubwalking sir john
why your da'ter is one o' the members
to be surei'd quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things
well vamp on to marlott will ye and order that carriage and maybe i'll drive round and inspect the club
the lad departed and durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun
not a soul passed that way for a long while and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills
ii   the village of marlott lay amid the northeastern undulations of the beautiful vale of blakemore or blackmoor aforesaid an engirdled and secluded region for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscapepainter though within a four hours' journey from london
it is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround itexcept perhaps during the droughts of summer
an unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow tortuous and miry ways
this fertile and sheltered tract of country in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of hambledon hill bulbarrow nettlecombetout dogbury high stoy and bubb down
the traveller from the coast who after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and cornlands suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments is surprised and delighted to behold extended like a map beneath him a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through
behind him the hills are open the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape the lanes are white the hedges low and plashed the atmosphere colourless
here in the valley the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale the fields are mere paddocks so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass
the atmosphere beneath is languorous and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine
arable lands are few and limited with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees mantling minor hills and dales within the major
such is the vale of blackmoor
the district is of historic no less than of topographical interest
the vale was known in former times as the forest of white hart from a curious legend of king henry iii's reign in which the killing by a certain thomas de la lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared was made the occasion of a heavy fine
in those days and till comparatively recent times the country was densely wooded
even now traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes and the hollowtrunked trees that shade so many of its pastures
the forests have departed but some old customs of their shades remain
many however linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form
the mayday dance for instance was to be discerned on the afternoon under notice in the guise of the club revel or clubwalking as it was there called
it was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of marlott though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony
its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women
in men's clubs such celebrations were though expiring less uncommon but either the natural shyness of the softer sex or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives had denuded such women's clubs as remained if any other did or this their glory and consummation
the club of marlott alone lived to uphold the local cerealia
it had walked for hundreds of years if not as benefitclub as votive sisterhood of some sort and it walked still
the banded ones were all dressed in white gownsa gay survival from old style days when cheerfulness and maytime were synonymsdays before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous average
their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional march of two and two round the parish
ideal and real clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and creeperlaced housefronts for though the whole troop wore white garments no two whites were alike among them
some approached pure blanching some had a bluish pallor some worn by the older characters which had possibly lain by folded for many a year inclined to a cadaverous tint and to a georgian style
in addition to the distinction of a white frock every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand and in her left a bunch of white flowers
the peeling of the former and the selection of the latter had been an operation of personal care
there were a few middleaged and even elderly women in the train their silverwiry hair and wrinkled faces scourged by time and trouble having almost a grotesque certainly a pathetic appearance in such a jaunty situation
in a true view perhaps there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say i have no pleasure in them than of her juvenile comrades
but let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm
the young girls formed indeed the majority of the band and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold and black and brown
some had beautiful eyes others a beautiful nose others a beautiful mouth and figure few if any had all
a difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny an inability to balance their heads and to dissociate selfconsciousness from their features was apparent in them and showed that they were genuine country girls unaccustomed to many eyes
and as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in some dream some affection some hobby at least some remote and distant hope which though perhaps starving to nothing still lived on as hopes will
they were all cheerful and many of them merry
they came round by the pure drop inn and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicketgate into the meadows when one of the women said  the loadalord
why tess durbeyfield if there isn't thy father riding hwome in a carriage
a young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation
she was a fine and handsome girlnot handsomer than some others possiblybut her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape
she wore a red ribbon in her hair and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment
as she looked round durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to the pure drop driven by a frizzleheaded brawny damsel with her gownsleeves rolled above her elbows
this was the cheerful servant of that establishment who in her part of factotum turned groom and ostler at times
durbeyfield leaning back and with his eyes closed luxuriously was waving his hand above his head and singing in a slow recitative  i'vegotagr'tfamilyvaultatkingsbereand knightedforefathersinleadcoffinsthere
the clubbists tittered except the girl called tessin whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes
he's tired that's all she said hastily and he has got a lift home because our own horse has to rest today
bless thy simplicity tess said her companions
he's got his marketnitch
hawhaw
look here i won't walk another inch with you if you say any jokes about him
tess cried and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck
in a moment her eyes grew moist and her glance drooped to the ground
perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more and order again prevailed
tess's pride would not allow her to turn her head again to learn what her father's meaning was if he had any and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green
by the time the spot was reached she has recovered her equanimity and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual
tess durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience
the dialect was on her tongue to some extent despite the village school the characteristic intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered by the syllable ur probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in human speech
the poutedup deep red mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward when they closed together after a word
phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still
as she walked along today for all her bouncing handsome womanliness you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks or her ninth sparkling from her eyes and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then
yet few knew and still fewer considered this
a small minority mainly strangers would look long at her in casually passing by and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness and wonder if they would ever see her again but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl and no more
nothing was seen or heard further of durbeyfield in his triumphal chariot under the conduct of the ostleress and the club having entered the allotted space dancing began
as there were no men in the company the girls danced at first with each other but when the hour for the close of labour drew on the masculine inhabitants of the village together with other idlers and pedestrians gathered round the spot and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner
among these onlookers were three young men of a superior class carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders and stout sticks in their hands
their general likeness to each other and their consecutive ages would almost have suggested that they might be what in fact they were brothers
the eldest wore the white tie high waistcoat and thinbrimmed hat of the regulation curate the second was the normal undergraduate the appearance of the third and youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him there was an uncribbed uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire implying that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove
that he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might only have been predicted of him
these three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending their whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the vale of blackmoor their course being southwesterly from the town of shaston on the northeast
they leant over the gate by the highway and inquired as to the meaning of the dance and the whitefrocked maids
the two elder of the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to amuse the third and make him in no hurry to move on
he unstrapped his knapsack put it with his stick on the hedgebank and opened the gate
what are you going to do angel
asked the eldest
i am inclined to go and have a fling with them
why not all of usjust for a minute or twoit will not detain us long
nono nonsense
said the first
dancing in public with a troop of country hoydenssuppose we should be seen
come along or it will be dark before we get to stourcastle and there's no place we can sleep at nearer than that besides we must get through another chapter of a counterblast to agnosticism before we turn in now i have taken the trouble to bring the book
all righti'll overtake you and cuthbert in five minutes don't stop i give my word that i will felix
the two elder reluctantly left him and walked on taking their brother's knapsack to relieve him in following and the youngest entered the field
this is a thousand pities he said gallantly to two or three of the girls nearest him as soon as there was a pause in the dance
where are your partners my dears
they've not left off work yet answered one of the boldest
they'll be here by and by
till then will you be one sir
certainly
but what's one among so many
better than none
'tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of your own sort and no clipsing and colling at all
now pick and choose
'sshdon't be so for'ard
said a shyer girl
the young man thus invited glanced them over and attempted some discrimination but as the group were all so new to him he could not very well exercise it
he took almost the first that came to hand which was not the speaker as she had expected nor did it happen to be tess durbeyfield
pedigree ancestral skeletons monumental record the d'urberville lineaments did not help tess in her life's battle as yet even to the extent of attracting to her a dancingpartner over the heads of the commonest peasantry
so much for norman blood unaided by victorian lucre
the name of the eclipsing girl whatever it was has not been handed down but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of a masculine partner that evening
yet such was the force of example that the village young men who had not hastened to enter the gate while no intruder was in the way now dropped in quickly and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure
the church clock struck when suddenly the student said that he must leavehe had been forgetting himselfhe had to join his companions
as he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on tess durbeyfield whose own large orbs wore to tell the truth the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her
he too was sorry then that owing to her backwardness he had not observed her and with that in his mind he left the pasture
on account of his long delay he started in a flyingrun down the lane westward and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise
he had not yet overtaken his brothers but he paused to get breath and looked back
he could see the white figures of the girls in the green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them
they seemed to have quite forgotten him already
all of them except perhaps one
this white shape stood apart by the hedge alone
from her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with whom he had not danced
trifling as the matter was he yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight
he wished that he had asked her he wished that he had inquired her name
she was so modest so expressive she had looked so soft in her thin white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly
however it could not be helped and turning and bending himself to a rapid walk he dismissed the subject from his mind
iii   as for tess durbeyfield she did not so easily dislodge the incident from her consideration
she had no spirit to dance again for a long time though she might have had plenty of partners but ah
they did not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done
it was not till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her wouldbe partner in the affirmative
she remained with her comrades till dusk and participated with a certain zest in the dancing though being heartwhole as yet she enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake little divining when she saw the soft torments the bitter sweets the pleasing pains and the agreeable distresses of those girls who had been wooed and won what she herself was capable of in that kind
the struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to herno more and when they became fierce she rebuked them
she might have stayed even later but the incident of her father's odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl's mind to make her anxious and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the parental cottage lay
while yet many score yards off other rhythmic sounds than those she had quitted became audible to her sounds that she knew wellso well
they were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing in a vigorous gallopade the favourite ditty of the spotted cow      i saw her lie do'own in yon'der green gro'ove         come love'
and i'll tell' you where'
the cradlerocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a moment and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place of the melody
god bless thy diment eyes
and thy waxen cheeks
and thy cherry mouth
and thy cubit's thighs
and every bit o' thy blessed body
after this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence and the spotted cow proceed as before
so matters stood when tess opened the door and paused upon the mat within it surveying the scene
the interior in spite of the melody struck upon the girl's senses with an unspeakable dreariness
from the holiday gaieties of the fieldthe white gowns the nosegays the willowwands the whirling movements on the green the flash of gentle sentiment towards the strangerto the yellow melancholy of this onecandled spectacle what a step
besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill selfreproach that she had not returned sooner to help her mother in these domesticities instead of indulging herself outofdoors
there stood her mother amid the group of children as tess had left her hanging over the monday washingtub which had now as always lingered on to the end of the week
out of that tub had come the day beforetess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorsethe very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grasswhich had been wrung up and ironed by her mother's own hands
as usual mrs durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child
the cradlerockers had done hard duty for so many years under the weight of so many children on that flagstone floor that they were worn nearly flat in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver's shuttle as mrs durbeyfield excited by her song trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long day's seething in the suds
nickknock nickknock went the cradle the candleflame stretched itself tall and began jigging up and down the water dribbled from the matron's elbows and the song galloped on to the end of the verse mrs durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while
even now when burdened with a young family joan durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune
no ditty floated into blackmoor vale from the outer world but tess's mother caught up its notation in a week
there still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of the freshness and even the prettiness of her youth rendering it probable that the personal charms which tess could boast of were in main part her mother's gift and therefore unknightly unhistorical
i'll rock the cradle for 'ee mother said the daughter gently
or i'll take off my best frock and help you wring up
i thought you had finished long ago
her mother bore tess no illwill for leaving the housework to her singlehanded efforts for so long indeed joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time feeling but slightly the lack of tess's assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them
tonight however she was even in a blither mood than usual
there was a dreaminess a preoccupation an exaltation in the maternal look which the girl could not understand
well i'm glad you've come her mother said as soon as the last note had passed out of her
i want to go and fetch your father but what's more'n that i want to tell 'ee what have happened
y'll be fess enough my poppet when th'st know
mrs durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect her daughter who had passed the sixth standard in the national school under a londontrained mistress spoke two languages the dialect at home more or less ordinary english abroad and to persons of quality
since i've been away
tess asked
ay
had it anything to do with father's making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon
why did 'er
i felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame
that wer all a part of the larry
we've been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole countyreaching all back long before oliver grumble's timeto the days of the pagan turkswith monuments and vaults and crests and 'scutcheons and the lord knows what all
in saint charles's days we was made knights o' the royal oak our real name being d'urberville
  don't that make your bosom plim
'twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee not because he'd been drinking as people supposed
i'm glad of that
will it do us any good mother
o yes
'tis thoughted that great things may come o't
no doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as 'tis known
your father learnt it on his way hwome from shaston and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter
where is father now
asked tess suddenly
her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer he called to see the doctor today in shaston
it is not consumption at all it seems
it is fat round his heart 'a says
there it is like this
joan durbeyfield as she spoke curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter c and used the other forefinger as a pointer
'at the present moment' he says to your father 'your heart is enclosed all round there and all round there this space is still open' 'a says
'as soon as it do meet so'mrs durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete'off you will go like a shadder mr durbeyfield' 'a says
'you mid last ten years you mid go off in ten months or ten days'
tess looked alarmed
her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon notwithstanding this sudden greatness
but where is father
she asked again
her mother put on a deprecating look
now don't you be bursting out angry
the poor manhe felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pa'son's newsthat he went up to rolliver's half an hour ago
he do want to get up his strength for his journey tomorrow with that load of beehives which must be delivered family or no
he'll have to start shortly after twelve tonight as the distance is so long
get up his strength
said tess impetuously the tears welling to her eyes
o my god
go to a publichouse to get up his strength
and you as well agreed as he mother
her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room and to impart a cowed look to the furniture and candle and children playing about and to her mother's face
no said the latter touchily i be not agreed
i have been waiting for 'ee to bide and keep house while i go fetch him
i'll go
o no tess
you see it would be no use
tess did not expostulate
she knew what her mother's objection meant
mrs durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side in readiness for this contemplated jaunt the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity
and take the compleat fortuneteller to the outhouse joan continued rapidly wiping her hands and donning the garments
the compleat fortuneteller was an old thick volume which lay on a table at her elbow so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type
tess took it up and her mother started
this going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of mrs durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children
to discover him at rolliver's to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval made her happy
a sort of halo an occidental glow came over life then
troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul
the youngsters not immediately within sight seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there
she felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing shutting her eyes to his defects of character and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover
tess being left alone with the younger children went first to the outhouse with the fortunetelling book and stuffed it into the thatch
a curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted
between the mother with her fastperishing lumber of superstitions folklore dialect and orally transmitted ballads and the daughter with her trained national teachings and standard knowledge under an infinitely revised code there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood
when they were together the jacobean and the victorian ages were juxtaposed
returning along the garden path tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day
she guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it but did not divine that it solely concerned herself
dismissing this however she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime in company with her nineyearold brother abraham and her sister elizalouisa of twelve and a half called 'lizalu the youngest ones being put to bed
there was an interval of four years and more between tess and the next of the family the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy and this lent her a deputymaternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors
next in juvenility to abraham came two more girls hope and modesty then a boy of three and then the baby who had just completed his first year
all these young souls were passengers in the durbeyfield shipentirely dependent on the judgement of the two durbeyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence
if the heads of the durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither were these halfdozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with themsix helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of durbeyfield
some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure gets his authority for speaking of nature's holy plan
it grew later and neither father nor mother reappeared
tess looked out of the door and took a mental journey through marlott
the village was shutting its eyes
candles and lamps were being put out everywhere she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand
her mother's fetching simply meant one more to fetch
tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood
abraham she said to her little brother do you put on your hatyou bain't afraidand go up to rolliver's and see what has gone wi' father and mother
the boy jumped promptly from his seat and opened the door and the night swallowed him up
half an hour passed yet again neither man woman nor child returned
abraham like his parents seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn
i must go myself she said
'lizalu then went to bed and tess locking them all in started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress a street laid out before inches of land had value and when onehanded clocks sufficiently subdivided the day
iv   rolliver's inn the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village could only boast of an offlicence hence as nobody could legally drink on the premises the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire so as to form a ledge
on this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of polynesia and wished they could have a restful seat inside
thus the strangers
but there were also local customers who felt the same wish and where there's a will there's a way
in a large bedroom upstairs the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady mrs rolliver were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons all seeking beatitude all old inhabitants of the nearer end of marlott and frequenters of this retreat
not only did the distance to the the pure drop the fullylicensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end but the far more serious question the quality of the liquor confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house
a gaunt fourpost bedstead which stood in the room afforded sittingspace for several persons gathered round three of its sides a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers another rested on the oakcarved cwoffer two on the washstand another on the stool and thus all were somehow seated at their ease
the stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins and spread their personalities warmly through the room
in this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers and the carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of solomon's temple
mrs durbeyfield having quickly walked hitherward after parting from tess opened the front door crossed the downstairs room which was in deep gloom and then unfastened the stairdoor like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well
her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process and her face as it rose into the light above the last stair encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom  
being a few private friends i've asked in to keep up clubwalking at my own expense the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps as glibly as a child repeating the catechism while she peered over the stairs
oh 'tis you mrs durbeyfieldlardhow you frightened mei thought it might be some gaffer sent by gover'ment
mrs durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave and turned to where her husband sat
he was humming absently to himself in a low tone i be as good as some folks here and there
i've got a great family vault at kingsberesubgreenhill and finer skillentons than any man in wessex
i've something to tell 'ee that's come into my head about thata grand projick
whispered his cheerful wife
here john don't 'ee see me
she nudged him while he looking through her as through a windowpane went on with his recitative
hush
don't 'ee sing so loud my good man said the landlady in case any member of the gover'ment should be passing and take away my licends
he's told 'ee what's happened to us i suppose
asked mrs durbeyfield
yesin a way
d'ye think there's any money hanging by it
ah that's the secret said joan durbeyfield sagely
however 'tis well to be kin to a coach even if you don't ride in 'en
she dropped her public voice and continued in a low tone to her husband i've been thinking since you brought the news that there's a great rich lady out by trantridge on the edge o' the chase of the name of d'urberville
heywhat's that
said sir john
she repeated the information
that lady must be our relation she said
and my projick is to send tess to claim kin
there is a lady of the name now you mention it said durbeyfield
pa'son tringham didn't think of that
but she's nothing beside wea junior branch of us no doubt hailing long since king norman's day
while this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed in their preoccupation that little abraham had crept into the room and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return
she is rich and she'd be sure to take notice o' the maid continued mrs durbeyfield and 'twill be a very good thing
i don't see why two branches o' one family should not be on visiting terms
yes and we'll all claim kin
said abraham brightly from under the bedstead
and we'll all go and see her when tess has gone to live with her and we'll ride in her coach and wear black clothes
how do you come here child
what nonsense be ye talking
go away and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready
  well tess ought to go to this other member of our family
she'd be sure to win the ladytess would and likely enough 'twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her
in short i know it
how
i tried her fate in the fortuneteller and it brought out that very thing
  you should ha' seen how pretty she looked today her skin is as sumple as a duchess'
what says the maid herself to going
i've not asked her
she don't know there is any such ladyrelation yet
but it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage and she won't say nay to going
tess is queer
but she's tractable at bottom
leave her to me
though this conversation had been private sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had and that tess their pretty eldest daughter had fine prospects in store
tess is a fine figure o' fun as i said to myself today when i zeed her vamping round parish with the rest observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone
but joan durbeyfield must mind that she don't get green malt in floor
it was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning and there was no reply
the conversation became inclusive and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below  
being a few private friends asked in tonight to keep up clubwalking at my own expense
the landlady had rapidly reused the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was tess
even to her mother's gaze the girl's young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middleage and hardly was a reproachful flash from tess's dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats hastily finish their ale and descend the stairs behind her mrs rolliver's caution following their footsteps
no noise please if ye'll be so good my dears or i mid lose my licends and be summons'd and i don't know what all
'night t'ye
they went home together tess holding one arm of her father and mrs durbeyfield the other
he had in truth drunk very littlenot a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections but the weakness of sir john's constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind
on reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to london and at another as if they were marching to bathwhich produced a comical effect frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings and like most comical effects not quite so comic after all
the two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from durbeyfield their cause and from abraham and from themselves and so they approached by degrees their own door the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence  i've got a family vault at kingsbere
hushdon't be so silly jacky said his wife
yours is not the only family that was of 'count in wold days
look at the anktells and horseys and the tringhams themselvesgone to seed a'most as much as youthough you was bigger folks than they that's true
thank god i was never of no family and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way
don't you be so sure o' that
from you nater 'tis my belief you've disgraced yourselves more than any o' us and was kings and queens outright at one time
tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestryi am afraid father won't be able to take the journey with the beehives tomorrow so early
i
i shall be all right in an hour or two said durbeyfield
it was eleven o'clock before the family were all in bed and two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in casterbridge before the saturday market began the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles and the horse and waggon being of the slowest
at halfpast one mrs durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept
the poor man can't go she said to her eldest daughter whose great eyes had opened the moment her mother's hand touched the door
tess sat up in bed lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information
but somebody must go she replied
it is late for the hives already
swarming will soon be over for the year and it we put off taking 'em till next week's market the call for 'em will be past and they'll be thrown on our hands
mrs durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency
some young feller perhaps would go
one of them who were so much after dancing with 'ee yesterday she presently suggested
o noi wouldn't have it for the world
declared tess proudly
and letting everybody know the reasonsuch a thing to be ashamed of
i think i could go if abraham could go with me to kip me company
her mother at length agreed to this arrangement
little abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world
meanwhile tess had hastily dressed herself and the twain lighting a lantern went out to the stable
the rickety little waggon was already laden and the girl led out the horse prince only a degree less rickety than the vehicle
the poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night at the lantern at their two figures as if he could not believe that at that hour when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest he was called upon to go out and labour
they put a stock of candleends into the lantern hung the latter to the offside of the load and directed the horse onward walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour
to cheer themselves as well as they could they made an artificial morning with the lantern some bread and butter and their own conversation the real morning being far from come
abraham as he more fully awoke for he had moved in a sort of trance so far began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair of that which resembled a giant's head
when they had passed the little town of stourcastle dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch they reached higher ground
still higher on their left the elevation called bulbarrow or bealbarrow wellnigh the highest in south wessex swelled into the sky engirdled by its earthen trenches
from hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward
they mounted in front of the waggon and abraham grew reflective
tess
he said in a preparatory tone after a silence
yes abraham
bain't you glad that we've become gentlefolk
not particular glad
but you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman
what
said tess lifting her face
that our great relation will help 'ee to marry a gentleman
i
our great relation
we have no such relation
what has put that into your head
i heard 'em talking about it up at rolliver's when i went to find father
there's a rich lady of our family out at trantridge and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady she'd put 'ee in the way of marrying a gentleman
his sister became abruptly still and lapsed into a pondering silence
abraham talked on rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition so that his sister's abstraction was of no account
he leant back against the hives and with upturned face made observations on the stars whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life
he asked how far away those twinklers were and whether god was on the other side of them
but ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation
if tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as nettlecombetout
the renewed subject which seemed to have impregnated the whole family filled tess with impatience
never mind that now
she exclaimed
did you say the stars were worlds tess
yes
all like ours
i don't know but i think so
they sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbardtree
most of them splendid and sounda few blighted
which do we live ona splendid one or a blighted one
a blighted one
'tis very unlucky that we didn't pitch on a sound one when there were so many more of 'em
yes
is it like that really tess
said abraham turning to her much impressed on reconsideration of this rare information
how would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one
well father wouldn't have coughed and creeped about as he does and wouldn't have got too tipsy to go on this journey and mother wouldn't have been always washing and never getting finished
and you would have been a rich lady readymade and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman
o aby don'tdon't talk of that any more
left to his reflections abraham soon grew drowsy
tess was not skilful in the management of a horse but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so
she made him a sort of nest in front of the hives in such a manner that he could not fall and taking the reins into her own hands jogged on as before
prince required but slight attention lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort
with no longer a companion to distract her tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever her back leaning against the hives
the mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul conterminous with the universe in space and with history in time
then examining the mesh of events in her own life she seemed to see the vanity of her father's pride the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother's fancy to see him as a grimacing personage laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry
everything grew more and more extravagant and she no longer knew how time passed
a sudden jerk shook her in her seat and tess awoke from the sleep into which she too had fallen
they were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness and the waggon had stopped
a hollow groan unlike anything she had ever heard in her life came from the front followed by a shout of hoi there
the lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out but another was shining in her facemuch brighter than her own had been
something terrible had happened
the harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way
in consternation tess jumped down and discovered the dreadful truth
the groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse prince
the morning mailcart with its two noiseless wheels speeding along these lanes like an arrow as it always did had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage
the pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy prince like a sword and from the wound his life's blood was spouting in a stream and falling with a hiss into the road
in her despair tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops
then she stood helplessly looking on
prince also stood firm and motionless as long as he could till he suddenly sank down in a heap
by this time the mailcart man had joined her and began dragging and unharnessing the hot form of prince
but he was already dead and seeing that nothing more could be done immediately the mailcart man returned to his own animal which was uninjured
you was on the wrong side he said
i am bound to go on with the mailbags so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your load
i'll send somebody to help you as soon as i can
it is getting daylight and you have nothing to fear
he mounted and sped on his way while tess stood and waited
the atmosphere turned pale the birds shook themselves in the hedges arose and twittered the lane showed all its white features and tess showed hers still whiter
the huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it
prince lay alongside still and stark his eyes half open the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him
'tis all my doingall mine
the girl cried gazing at the spectacle
no excuse for menone
what will mother and father live on now
aby aby
she shook the child who had slept soundly through the whole disaster
we can't go on with our loadprince is killed
when abraham realized all the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face
why i danced and laughed only yesterday
she went on to herself
to think that i was such a fool
'tis because we be on a blighted star and not a sound one isn't it tess
murmured abraham through his tears
in silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless
at length a sound and an approaching object proved to them that the driver of the mailcar had been as good as his word
a farmer's man from near stourcastle came up leading a strong cob
he was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of prince and the load taken on towards casterbridge
the evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot of the accident
prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning but the place of the bloodpool was still visible in the middle of the road though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles
all that was left of prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly hauled and with his hoofs in the air and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight he retraced the eight or nine miles to marlott
tess had gone back earlier
how to break the news was more than she could think
it was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of her parents that they already knew of their loss though this did not lessen the selfreproach which she continued to heap upon herself for her negligence
but the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving family though in the present case it meant ruin and in the other it would only have meant inconvenience
in the durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare
nobody blamed tess as she blamed herself
when it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a very few shillings for prince's carcase because of his decrepitude durbeyfield rose to the occasion
no said he stoically i won't sell his old body
when we d'urbervilles was knights in the land we didn't sell our chargers for cat's meat
let 'em keep their shillings
he've served me well in his lifetime and i won't part from him now
he worked harder the next day in digging a grave for prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family
when the hole was ready durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it the children following in funeral train
abraham and 'lizalu sobbed hope and modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls and when prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave
the breadwinner had been taken away from them what would they do
is he gone to heaven
asked abraham between the sobs
then durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth and the children cried anew
all except tess
her face was dry and pale as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess
v   the haggling business which had mainly depended on the horse became disorganized forthwith
distress if not penury loomed in the distance
durbeyfield was what was locally called a slacktwisted fellow he had good strength to work at times but the times could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement and having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the daylabourer he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide
tess meanwhile as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it and then her mother broached her scheme
we must take the ups wi' the downs tess said she and never could your high blood have been found out at a more calledfor moment
you must try your friends
do ye know that there is a very rich mrs d'urberville living on the outskirts o' the chase who must be our relation
you must go to her and claim kin and ask for some help in our trouble
i shouldn't care to do that says tess
if there is such a lady 'twould be enough for us if she were friendlynot to expect her to give us help
you could win her round to do anything my dear
besides perhaps there's more in it than you know of
i've heard what i've heard goodnow
the oppressive sense of the harm she had done led tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of to her such doubtful profit
her mother might have made inquiries and have discovered that this mrs d'urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity
but tess's pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her
i'd rather try to get work she murmured
durbeyfield you can settle it said his wife turning to where he sat in the background
if you say she ought to go she will go
i don't like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin murmured he
i'm the head of the noblest branch o' the family and i ought to live up to it
his reasons for staying away were worse to tess than her own objections to going
well as i killed the horse mother she said mournfully i suppose i ought to do something
i don't mind going and seeing her but you must leave it to me about asking for help
and don't go thinking about her making a match for meit is silly
very well said tess
observed her father sententiously
who said i had such a thought
asked joan
i fancy it is in your mind mother
but i'll go
rising early next day she walked to the hilltown called shaston and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from shaston eastward to chaseborough passing near trantridge the parish in which the vague and mysterious mrs d'urberville had her residence
tess durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the northeastern undulations of the vale in which she had been born and in which her life had unfolded
the vale of blackmoor was to her the world and its inhabitants the races thereof
from the gates and stiles of marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now
she had seen daily from her chamberwindow towers villages faint white mansions above all the town of shaston standing majestically on its height its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun
she had hardly ever visited the place only a small tract even of the vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection
much less had she been far outside the valley
every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives' faces but for what lay beyond her judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving a year or two before this date
in those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age and had used to be seen about the village as one of threeall nearly of the same yearwalking home from school side by side tess the middle onein a pink print pinafore of a finely reticulated pattern worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiarymarching on upon long stalky legs in tight stockings which had little ladderlike holes at the knees torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures her then earthcoloured hair hanging like pothooks the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of tess her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters
as tess grew older and began to see how matters stood she felt quite a malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them
her mother's intelligence was that of a happy child joan durbeyfield was simply an additional one and that not the eldest to her own long family of waiters on providence
however tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones and to help them as much as possible she used as soon as she left school to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms or by preference at milking or buttermaking processes which she had learnt when her father had owned cows and being deftfingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled
every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens and that tess should be the representative of the durbeyfields at the d'urberville mansion came as a thing of course
in this instance it must be admitted that the durbeyfields were putting their fairest side outward
she alighted from the van at trantridge cross and ascended on foot a hill in the direction of the district known as the chase on the borders of which as she had been informed mrs d'urberville's seat the slopes would be found
it was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense with fields and pastures and a grumbling farmer out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook or by crook
it was more far more a countryhouse built for enjoyment pure and simple with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner and tended by a bailiff
the crimson brick lodge came first in sight up to its eaves in dense evergreens
tess thought this was the mansion itself till passing through the side wicket with some trepidation and onward to a point at which the drive took a turn the house proper stood in full view
it was of recent erectionindeed almost newand of the same rich red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge
far behind the corner of the housewhich rose like a geranium bloom against the subdued colours aroundstretched the soft azure landscape of the chasea truly venerable tract of forest land one of the few remaining woodlands in england of undoubted primaeval date wherein druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks and where enormous yewtrees not planted by the hand of man grew as they had grown when they were pollarded for bows
all this sylvan antiquity however though visible from the slopes was outside the immediate boundaries of the estate
everything on this snug property was bright thriving and well kept acres of glasshouses stretched down the inclines to the copses at their feet
everything looked like moneylike the last coin issued from the mint
the stables partly screened by austrian pines and evergreen oaks and fitted with every late appliance were as dignified as chapelsofease
on the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent its door being towards her
simple tess durbeyfield stood at gaze in a halfalarmed attitude on the edge of the gravel sweep
her feet had brought her onward to this point before she had quite realized where she was and now all was contrary to her expectation
i thought we were an old family but this is all new
she said in her artlessness
she wished that she had not fallen in so readily with her mother's plans for claiming kin and had endeavoured to gain assistance nearer home
the d'urbervillesor stoked'urbervilles as they at first called themselveswho owned all this were a somewhat unusual family to find in such an oldfashioned part of the country
parson tringham had spoken truly when he said that our shambling john durbeyfield was the only really lineal representative of the old d'urberville family existing in the county or near it he might have added what he knew very well that the stoked'urbervilles were no more d'urbervilles of the true tree then he was himself
yet it must be admitted that this family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly wanted such renovation
when old mr simon stoke latterly deceased had made his fortune as an honest merchant some said moneylender in the north he decided to settle as a county man in the south of england out of hail of his business district and in doing this he felt the necessity of recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with the smart tradesman of the past and that would be less commonplace than the original bald stark words
conning for an hour in the british museum the pages of works devoted to extinct halfextinct obscured and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of england in which he proposed to settle he considered that d'urberville looked and sounded as well as any of them and d'urberville accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally
yet he was not an extravagantminded man in this and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his intermarriages and aristocratic links never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation
of this work of imagination poor tess and her parents were naturally in ignorancemuch to their discomfiture indeed the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them who supposed that though to be wellfavoured might be the gift of fortune a family name came by nature
tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent
it was that of a tall young man smoking
he had an almost swarthy complexion with full lips badly moulded though red and smooth above which was a wellgroomed black moustache with curled points though his age could not be more than three or fourandtwenty
despite the touches of barbarism in his contours there was a singular force in the gentleman's face and in his bold rolling eye
well my beauty what can i do for you
said he coming forward
and perceiving that she stood quite confounded never mind me
i am mr d'urberville
have you come to see me or my mother
this embodiment of a d'urberville and a namesake differed even more from what tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed
she had dreamed of an aged and dignified face the sublimation of all the d'urberville lineaments furrowed with incarnate memories representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family's and england's history
but she screwed herself up to the work in hand since she could not get out of it and answered  i came to see your mother sir
i am afraid you cannot see hershe is an invalid replied the present representative of the spurious house for this was mr alec the only son of the lately deceased gentleman
cannot i answer your purpose
what is the business you wish to see her about
it isn't businessit isi can hardly say what
pleasure
oh no
why sir if i tell you it will seem  tess's sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong that notwithstanding her awe of him and her general discomfort at being here her rosy lips curved towards a smile much to the attraction of the swarthy alexander
it is so very foolish she stammered i fear can't tell you
never mind i like foolish things
try again my dear said he kindly
mother asked me to come tess continued and indeed i was in the mind to do so myself likewise
but i did not think it would be like this
i came sir to tell you that we are of the same family as you
ho
poor relations
yes
stokes
no d'urbervilles
ay ay i mean d'urbervilles
our names are worn away to durbeyfield but we have several proofs that we are d'urbervilles
antiquarians hold we areandand we have an old seal marked with a ramping lion on a shield and a castle over him
and we have a very old silver spoon round in the bowl like a little ladle and marked with the same castle
but it is so worn that mother uses it to stir the peasoup
a castle argent is certainly my crest said he blandly
and my arms a lion rampant
and so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to youas we've lost our horse by a bad accident and are the oldest branch o' the family
very kind of your mother i'm sure
and i for one don't regret her step
alec looked at tess as he spoke in a way that made her blush a little
and so my pretty girl you've come on a friendly visit to us as relations
i suppose i have faltered tess looking uncomfortable again
wellthere's no harm in it
where do you live
what are you
she gave him brief particulars and responding to further inquiries told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had brought her
it is a long while before he returns past trantridge cross
supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time my pretty coz
tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible but the young man was pressing and she consented to accompany him
he conducted her about the lawns and flowerbeds and conservatories and thence to the fruitgarden and greenhouses where he asked her if she liked strawberries
yes said tess when they come
they are already here
d'urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her handing them back to her as he stooped and presently selecting a specially fine product of the british queen variety he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth
nono
she said quickly putting her fingers between his hand and her lips
i would rather take it in my own hand
nonsense
he insisted and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in
they had spent some time wandering desultorily thus tess eating in a halfpleased halfreluctant state whatever d'urberville offered her
when she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little basket with them and then the two passed round to the rosetrees whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom
she obeyed like one in a dream and when she could affix no more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat and heaped her basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty
at last looking at his watch he said now by the time you have had something to eat it will be time for you to leave if you want to catch the carrier to shaston
come here and i'll see what grub i can find
stoke d'urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent where he left her soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon which he put before her himself
it was evidently the gentleman's wish not to be disturbed in this pleasant ttette by the servantry
do you mind my smoking
he asked
oh not at all sir
he watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent and tess durbeyfield did not divine as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom that there behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the tragic mischief of her dramaone who stood fair to be the bloodred ray in the spectrum of her young life
she had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now and it was this that caused alec d'urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her
it was a luxuriance of aspect a fulness of growth which made her appear more of a woman than she really was
she had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted
it had troubled her mind occasionally till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure
she soon had finished her lunch
now i am going home sir she said rising
and what do they call you
he asked as he accompanied her along the drive till they were out of sight of the house
tess durbeyfield down at marlott
and you say your people have lost their horse
ikilled him
she answered her eyes filling with tears as she gave particulars of prince's death
and i don't know what to do for father on account of it
i must think if i cannot do something
my mother must find a berth for you
but tess no nonsense about 'd'urberville''durbeyfield' only you knowquite another name
i wish for no better sir said she with something of dignity
for a momentonly for a momentwhen they were in the turning of the drive between the tall rhododendrons and conifers before the lodge became visible he inclined his face towards her as ifbut no he thought better of it and let her go
thus the thing began
had she perceived this meeting's import she might have asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day by the wrong man and not by some other man the right and desired one in all respectsas nearly as humanity can supply the right and desired yet to him who amongst her acquaintance might have approximated to this kind she was but a transient impression half forgotten
in the illjudged execution of the welljudged plan of things the call seldom produces the comer the man to love rarely coincides with the hour for loving
nature does not often say see
to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing or reply here
to a body's cry of where
till the hideandseek has become an irksome outworn game
we may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition a closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us round and along but such completeness is not to be prophesied or even conceived as possible
enough that in the present case as in millions it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment a missing counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came
out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties disappointments shocks catastrophes and passingstrange destinies
when d'urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a chair reflecting with a pleased gleam in his face
then he broke into a loud laugh
well i'm damned
what a funny thing
hahaha
and what a crumby girl
vi   tess went down the hill to trantridge cross and inattentively waited to take her seat in the van returning from chaseborough to shaston
she did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered though she answered them and when they had started anew she rode along with an inward and not an outward eye
one among her fellowtravellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before why you be quite a posy
and such roses in early june
then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision roses at her breasts roses in her hat roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim
she blushed and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her
when the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket where she covered them with her handkerchief
then she fell to reflecting again and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin
like all the cottagers in blackmoor vale tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions she thought this an ill omenthe first she had noticed that day
the van travelled only so far as shaston and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountaintown into the vale to marlott
her mother had advised her to stay here for the night at the house of a cottagewoman they knew if she should feel too tired to come on and this tess did not descending to her home till the following afternoon
when she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother's triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim
oh yes i know all about it
i told 'ee it would be all right and now 'tis proved
since i've been away
what has
said tess rather wearily
her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval and went on banteringly so you've brought 'em round
how do you know mother
i've had a letter
tess then remembered that there would have been time for this
they saymrs d'urberville saysthat she wants you to look after a little fowlfarm which is her hobby
but this is only her artful way of getting 'ee there without raising your hopes
she's going to own 'ee as kinthat's the meaning o't
but i didn't see her
you zid somebody i suppose
i saw her son
and did he own 'ee
wellhe called me coz
an' i knew it
jackyhe called her coz
cried joan to her husband
well he spoke to his mother of course and she do want 'ee there
but i don't know that i am apt at tending fowls said the dubious tess
then i don't know who is apt
you've be'n born in the business and brought up in it
they that be born in a business always know more about it than any 'prentice
besides that's only just a show of something for you to do that you midn't feel beholden
i don't altogether think i ought to go said tess thoughtfully
who wrote the letter
will you let me look at it
mrs d'urberville wrote it
here it is
the letter was in the third person and briefly informed mrs durbeyfield that her daughter's services would be useful to that lady in the management of her poultryfarm that a comfortable room would be provided for her if she could come and that the wages would be on a liberal scale if they liked her
ohthat's all
said tess
you couldn't expect her to throw her arms round 'ee an' to kiss and to coll 'ee all at once
tess looked out of the window
i would rather stay here with father and you she said
but why
i'd rather not tell you why mother indeed i don't quite know why
a week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood
her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse
hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room saying the gentleman's been here
her mother hastened to explain smiles breaking from every inch of her person
mrs d'urberville's son had called on horseback having been riding by chance in the direction of marlott
he had wished to know finally in the name of his mother if tess could really come to manage the old lady's fowlfarm or not the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy
mr d'urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear he knows you must be worth your weight in gold
he is very much interested in 'eetruth to tell
tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when in her own esteem she had sunk so low
it is very good of him to think that she murmured and if i was quite sure how it would be living there i would go anywhen
he is a mighty handsome man
i don't think so said tess coldly
well there's your chance whether or no and i'm sure he wears a beautiful diamond ring
yes said little abraham brightly from the windowbench and i seed it
and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers
mother why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers
hark at that child
cried mrs durbeyfield with parenthetic admiration
perhaps to show his diamond ring murmured sir john dreamily from his chair
i'll think it over said tess leaving the room
well she's made a conquest o' the younger branch of us straight off continued the matron to her husband and she's a fool if she don't follow it up
i don't quite like my children going away from home said the haggler
as the head of the family the rest ought to come to me
but do let her go jacky coaxed his poor witless wife
he's struck wi' heryou can see that
he called her coz
he'll marry her most likely and make a lady of her and then she'll be what her forefathers was
john durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health and this supposition was pleasant to him
well perhaps that's what young mr d'urberville means he admitted and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood by linking on to the old line
tess the little rogue
and have she really paid 'em a visit to such an end as this
meanwhile tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberrybushes in the garden and over prince's grave
when she came in her mother pursued her advantage
well what be you going to do
she asked
i wish i had seen mrs d'urberville said tess
i think you mid as well settle it
then you'll see her soon enough
her father coughed in his chair
i don't know what to say
answered the girl restlessly
it is for you to decide
i killed the old horse and i suppose i ought to do something to get ye a new one
butbuti don't quite like mr d'urberville being there
the children who had made use of this idea of tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk which they imagined the other family to be as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse began to cry at tess's reluctance and teased and reproached her for hesitating
tess won't gooo and be made a laady ofno she says she wooon't
they wailed with square mouths
and we shan't have a nice new horse and lots o' golden money to buy fairlings
and tess won't look pretty in her best cloze no mooore
her mother chimed in to the same tune a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely also weighed in the argument
her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality
i will go said tess at last
her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl's consent
that's right
for such a pretty maid as 'tis this is a fine chance
tess smiled crossly
i hope it is a chance for earning money
it is no other kind of chance
you had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish
mrs durbeyfield did not promise
she was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough after the visitor's remarks to say a good deal
thus it was arranged and the young girl wrote agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required
she was duly informed that mrs d'urberville was glad of her decision and that a springcart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the vale on the day after the morrow when she must hold herself prepared to start
mrs d'urberville's handwriting seemed rather masculine
a cart
murmured joan durbeyfield doubtingly
it might have been a carriage for her own kin
having at last taken her course tess was less restless and abstracted going about her business with some selfassurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous
she had hoped to be a teacher at the school but the fates seemed to decide otherwise
being mentally older than her mother she did not regard mrs durbeyfield's matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment
the lightminded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth
vii   on the morning appointed for her departure tess was awake before dawnat the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clearvoiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken
she remained upstairs packing till breakfasttime and then came down in her ordinary weekday clothes her sunday apparel being carefully folded in her box
her mother expostulated
you will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dand than that
but i am going to work
said tess
well yes said mrs durbeyfield and in a private tone at first there mid be a little pretence o't 
but i think it will be wiser of 'ee to put your best side outward she added
very well i suppose you know best replied tess with calm abandonment
and to please her parent the girl put herself quite in joan's hands saying serenelydo what you like with me mother
mrs durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability
first she fetched a great basin and washed tess's hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times
she tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual
then she put upon her the white frock that tess had worn at the clubwalking the airy fulness of which supplementing her enlarged coiffure imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a child
i declare there's a hole in my stockingheel
said tess
never mind holes in your stockingsthey don't speak
when i was a maid so long as i had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha' found me in heels
her mother's pride in the girl's appearance led her to step back like a painter from his easel and survey her work as a whole
you must zee yourself
she cried
it is much better than you was t'other day
as the lookingglass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of tess's person at one time mrs durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement and so made a large reflector of the panes as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do
after this she went downstairs to her husband who was sitting in the lower room
i'll tell 'ee what 'tis durbeyfield said she exultingly he'll never have the heart not to love her
but whatever you do don't zay too much to tess of his fancy for her and this chance she has got
she is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him or against going there even now
if all goes well i shall certainly be for making some return to pa'son at stagfoot lane for telling usdear good man
however as the moment for the girl's setting out drew nigh when the first excitement of the dressing had passed off a slight misgiving found place in joan durbeyfield's mind
it prompted the matron to say that she would walk a little wayas far as to the point where the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer world
at the top tess was going to be met with the springcart sent by the stoked'urbervilles and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks to be in readiness
seeing their mother put on her bonnet the younger children clamoured to go with her
i do want to walk a littleways wi' sissy now she's going to marry our gentlemancousin and wear fine cloze
now said tess flushing and turning quickly i'll hear no more o' that
mother how could you ever put such stuff into their heads
going to work my dears for our rich relation and help get enough money for a new horse said mrs durbeyfield pacifically
goodbye father said tess with a lumpy throat
goodbye my maid said sir john raising his head from his breast as he suspended his nap induced by a slight excess this morning in honour of the occasion
well i hope my young friend will like such a comely sample of his own blood
and tell'n tess that being sunk quite from our former grandeur i'll sell him the titleyes sell itand at no onreasonable figure
not for less than a thousand pound
cried lady durbeyfield
tell'ni'll take a thousand pound
well i'll take less when i come to think o't
he'll adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like myself can
tell'n he shall hae it for a hundred
but i won't stand upon triflestell'n he shall hae it for fiftyfor twenty pound
yes twenty poundthat's the lowest
dammy family honour is family honour and i won't take a penny less
tess's eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the sentiments that were in her
she turned quickly and went out
so the girls and their mother all walked together a child on each side of tess holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from time to time as at one who was about to do great things her mother just behind with the smallest the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence and backed by simplesouled vanity
they followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent on the crest of which the vehicle from trantridge was to receive her this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope
far away behind the first hills the clifflike dwellings of shaston broke the line of the ridge
nobody was visible in the elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all tess's worldly possessions
bide here a bit and the cart will soon come no doubt said mrs durbeyfield
yes i see it yonder
it had comeappearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest upland and stopping beside the boy with the barrow
her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther and bidding them a hasty goodbye tess bent her steps up the hill
they saw her white shape draw near to the springcart on which her box was already placed
but before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit came round the bend of the road there passed the luggagecart and halted beside tess who looked up as if in great surprise
her mother perceived for the first time that the second vehicle was not a humble conveyance like the first but a spickandspan gig or dogcart highly varnished and equipped
the driver was a young man of three or fourandtwenty with a cigar between his teeth wearing a dandy cap drab jacket breeches of the same hue white neckcloth stickup collar and brown drivingglovesin short he was the handsome horsey young buck who had visited joan a week or two before to get her answer about tess
mrs durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child
then she looked down then stared again
could she be deceived as to the meaning of this
is dat the gentlemankinsman who'll make sissy a lady
asked the youngest child
meanwhile the muslined form of tess could be seen standing still undecided beside this turnout whose owner was talking to her
her seeming indecision was in fact more than indecision it was misgiving
she would have preferred the humble cart
the young man dismounted and appeared to urge her to ascend
she turned her face down the hill to her relatives and regarded the little group
something seemed to quicken her to a determination possibly the thought that she had killed prince
she suddenly stepped up he mounted beside her and immediately whipped on the horse
in a moment they had passed the slow cart with the box and disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill
directly tess was out of sight and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end the little ones' eyes filled with tears
the youngest child said i wish poor poor tess wasn't gone away to be a lady
and lowering the corners of his lips burst out crying
the new point of view was infectious and the next child did likewise and then the next till the whole three of them wailed loud
there were tears also in joan durbeyfield's eyes as she turned to go home
but by the time she had got back to the village she was passively trusting to the favour of accident
however in bed that night she sighed and her husband asked her what was the matter
oh i don't know exactly she said
i was thinking that perhaps it would ha' been better if tess had not gone
oughtn't ye to have thought of that before
well 'tis a chance for the maidstill if 'twere the doing again i wouldn't let her go till i had found out whether the gentleman is really a goodhearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman
yes you ought perhaps to ha' done that snored sir john
joan durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere well as one of the genuine stock she ought to make her way with 'en if she plays her trump card aright
and if he don't marry her afore he will after
for that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye can see
what's her trump card
her d'urberville blood you mean
no stupid her faceas 'twas mine
viii   having mounted beside her alec d'urberville drove rapidly along the crest of the first hill chatting compliments to tess as they went the cart with her box being left far behind
rising still an immense landscape stretched around them on every side behind the green valley of her birth before a gray country of which she knew nothing except from her first brief visit to trantridge
thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent of nearly a mile
ever since the accident with her father's horse tess durbeyfield courageous as she naturally was had been exceedingly timid on wheels the least irregularity of motion startled her
she began to get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor's driving
you will go down slow sir i suppose
she said with attempted unconcern
d'urberville looked round upon her nipped his cigar with the tips of his large white centreteeth and allowed his lips to smile slowly of themselves
why tess he answered after another whiff or two it isn't a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that
why i always go down at full gallop
there's nothing like it for raising your spirits
but perhaps you need not now
ah he said shaking his head there are two to be reckoned with
it is not me alone
tib has to be considered and she has a very queer temper
who
why this mare
i fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just then
didn't you notice it
don't try to frighten me sir said tess stiffly
well i don't
if any living man can manage this horse i can i won't say any living man can do itbut if such has the power i am he
why do you have such a horse
ah well may you ask it
it was my fate i suppose
tib has killed one chap and just after i bought her she nearly killed me
and then take my word for it i nearly killed her
but she's touchy still very touchy and one's life is hardly safe behind her sometimes
they were just beginning to descend and it was evident that the horse whether of her own will or of his the latter being the more likely knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly required a hint from behind
down down they sped the wheels humming like a top the dogcart rocking right and left its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in relation to the line of progress the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them
sometimes a wheel was off the ground it seemed for many yards sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge and flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs outshone the daylight
the aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance the two banks dividing like a splitting stick one rushing past at each shoulder
the wind blew through tess's white muslin to her very skin and her washed hair flew out behind
she was determined to show no open fear but she clutched d'urberville's reinarm
don't touch my arm
we shall be thrown out if you do
hold on round my waist
she grasped his waist and so they reached the bottom
safe thank god in spite of your fooling
said she her face on fire
tessfie
that's temper
said d'urberville
'tis truth
well you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself our of danger
she had not considered what she had been doing whether he were man or woman stick or stone in her involuntary hold on him
recovering her reserve she sat without replying and thus they reached the summit of another declivity
now then again
said d'urberville
no no
said tess
show more sense do please
but when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the county they must get down again he retorted
he loosened rein and away they went a second time
d'urberville turned his face to her as they rocked and said in playful raillery now then put your arms round my waist again as you did before my beauty
never
said tess independently holding on as well as she could without touching him
let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips tess or even on that warmed cheek and i'll stopon my honour i will
tess surprised beyond measure slid farther back still on her seat at which he urged the horse anew and rocked her the more
will nothing else do
she cried at length in desperation her large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal
this dressing her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose
nothing dear tess he replied
oh i don't knowvery well i don't mind
she panted miserably
he drew rein and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting the desired salute when as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty she dodged aside
his arms being occupied with the reins there was left him no power to prevent her manoeuvre
now damn iti'll break both our necks
swore her capriciously passionate companion
so you can go from your word like that you young witch can you
very well said tess i'll not move since you be so determined
but ithought you would be kind to me and protect me as my kinsman
kinsman be hanged
now
but i don't want anybody to kiss me sir
she implored a big tear beginning to roll down her face and the corners of her mouth trembling in her attempts not to cry
and i wouldn't ha' come if i had known
he was inexorable and she sat still and d'urberville gave her the kiss of mastery
no sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame took out her handkerchief and wiped the spot on her cheek that had been touched by his lips
his ardour was nettled at the sight for the act on her part had been unconsciously done
you are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl
said the young man
tess made no reply to this remark of which indeed she did not quite comprehend the drift unheeding the snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her cheek
she had in fact undone the kiss as far as such a thing was physically possible
with a dim sense that he was vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on near melbury down and wingreen till she saw to her consternation that there was yet another descent to be undergone
you shall be made sorry for that
he resumed his injured tone still remaining as he flourished the whip anew
unless that is you agree willingly to let me do it again and no handkerchief
she sighed
very well sir
she said
ohlet me get my hat
at the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road their present speed on the upland being by no means slow
d'urberville pulled up and said he would get it for her but tess was down on the other side
she turned back and picked up the article
you look prettier with it off upon my soul if that's possible he said contemplating her over the back of the vehicle
now then up again
what's the matter
the hat was in place and tied but tess had not stepped forward
no sir she said revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her eye lit in defiant triumph not again if i know it
whatyou won't get up beside me
no i shall walk
'tis five or six miles yet to trantridge
i don't care if 'tis dozens
besides the cart is behind
you artful hussy
now tell medidn't you make that hat blow off on purpose
i'll swear you did
her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion
then d'urberville cursed and swore at her and called her everything he could think of for the trick
turning the horse suddenly he tried to drive back upon her and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge
but he could not do this short of injuring her
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words
cried tess with spirit from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled
i don't like 'ee at all
i hate and detest you
i'll go back to mother i will
d'urberville's bad temper cleared up at sight of hers and he laughed heartily
well i like you all the better he said
come let there be peace
i'll never do it any more against your will
my life upon it now
still tess could not be induced to remount
she did not however object to his keeping his gig alongside her and in this manner at a slow pace they advanced towards the village of trantridge
from time to time d'urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour
she might in truth have safely trusted him now but he had forfeited her confidence for the time and she kept on the ground progressing thoughtfully as if wondering whether it would be wiser to return home
her resolve however had been taken and it seemed vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now unless for graver reasons
how could she face her parents get back her box and disconcert the whole scheme for the rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds
a few minutes later the chimneys of the slopes appeared in view and in a snug nook to the right the poultryfarm and cottage of tess' destination
ix   the community of fowls to which tess had been appointed as supervisor purveyor nurse surgeon and friend made its headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden but was now a trampled and sanded square
the house was overrun with ivy its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower
the lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds who walked about them with a proprietary air as though the place had been built by themselves and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard
the descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection had cost so much of their forefathers' money and had been in their possession for several generations before the d'urbervilles came and built here was indifferently turned into a fowlhouse by mrs stoked'urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law
'twas good enough for christians in grandfather's time they said
the rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks
distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists
the chimneycorner and onceblazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives in which the hens laid their eggs while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion
the garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall and could only be entered through a door
when tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered
she had come from the manorhouse
mrs d'urberville wants the fowls as usual she said but perceiving that tess did not quite understand she explained mis'ess is a old lady and blind
blind
said tess
almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took under her companion's direction two of the most beautiful of the hamburghs in her arms and followed the maidservant who had likewise taken two to the adjacent mansion which though ornate and imposing showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creaturesfeathers floating within view of the front and hencoops standing on the grass
in a sittingroom on the groundfloor ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light was the owner and mistress of the estate a whitehaired woman of not more than sixty or even less wearing a large cap
she had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages has been laboriously striven after and reluctantly let go rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind
tess walked up to this lady with her feathered chargesone sitting on each arm
ah you are the young woman come to look after my birds
said mrs d'urberville recognizing a new footstep
i hope you will be kind to them
my bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person
well where are they
ah this is strut
but he is hardly so lively today is he
he is alarmed at being handled by a stranger i suppose
and phena tooyes they are a little frightenedaren't you dears
but they will soon get used to you
while the old lady had been speaking tess and the other maid in obedience to her gestures had placed the fowls severally in her lap and she had felt them over from head to tail examining their beaks their combs the manes of the cocks their wings and their claws
her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled
she handled their crops and knew what they had eaten and if too little or too much her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind
the birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the yard and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the old womanhamburghs bantams cochins brahmas dorkings and such other sorts as were in fashion just thenher perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees
it reminded tess of a confirmation in which mrs d'urberville was the bishop the fowls the young people presented and herself and the maidservant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up
at the end of the ceremony mrs d'urberville abruptly asked tess wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations can you whistle
whistle ma'am
yes whistle tunes
tess could whistle like most other countrygirls though the accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company
however she blandly admitted that such was the fact
then you will have to practise it every day
i had a lad who did it very well but he has left
i want you to whistle to my bullfinches as i cannot see them i like to hear them and we teach 'em airs that way
tell her where the cages are elizabeth
you must begin tomorrow or they will go back in their piping
they have been neglected these several days
mr d'urberville whistled to 'em this morning ma'am said elizabeth
he
pooh
the old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance and she made no further reply
thus the reception of tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated and the birds were taken back to their quarters
the girl's surprise at mrs d'urberville's manner was not great for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no more
but she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the socalled kinship
she gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her son
but in that too she was mistaken
mrs d'urberville was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully and to be bitterly fond
in spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone now that she was once installed there and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post
as soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop and seriously screwed up her mouth for the longneglected practice
she found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the lips and no clear note at all
she remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing wondering how she could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature till she became aware of a movement among the ivyboughs which cloaked the gardenwall no less then the cottage
looking that way she beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot
it was alec d'urberville whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she had lodgings
upon my honour
cried he there was never before such a beautiful thing in nature or art as you look 'cousin' tess 'cousin' had a faint ring of mockery
i have been watching you from over the wallsitting like impatience on a monument and pouting up that pretty red mouth to whistling shape and whooing and whooing and privately swearing and never being able to produce a note
why you are quite cross because you can't do it
i may be cross but i didn't swear
ah
i understand why you are tryingthose bullies
my mother wants you to carry on their musical education
how selfish of her
as if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for any girl
i would flatly refuse if i were you
but she wants me particularly to do it and to be ready by tomorrow morning
does she
well theni'll give you a lesson or two
oh no you won't
said tess withdrawing towards the door
nonsense i don't want to touch you
seei'll stand on this side of the wirenetting and you can keep on the other so you may feel quite safe
now look here you screw up your lips too harshly
there 'tisso
he suited the action to the word and whistled a line of take o take those lips away
but the allusion was lost upon tess
now try said d'urberville
she attempted to look reserved her face put on a sculptural severity
but he persisted in his demand and at last to get rid of him she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note laughing distressfully however and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed
he encouraged her with try again
tess was quite serious painfully serious by this time and she triedultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound
the momentary pleasure of success got the better of her her eyes enlarged and she involuntarily smiled in his face
that's it
now i have started youyou'll go on beautifully
therei said i would not come near you and in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man i'll keep my word  tess do you think my mother a queer old soul
i don't know much of her yet sir
you'll find her so she must be to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches
i am rather out of her books just now but you will be quite in favour if you treat her livestock well
good morning
if you meet with any difficulties and want help here don't go to the bailiff come to me
it was in the economy of this rgime that tess durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place
her first day's experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days
a familiarity with alec d'urberville's presencewhich that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were aloneremoved much of her original shyness of him without however implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind
but she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother and through that lady's comparative helplessness upon him
she soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in mrs d'urberville's room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably
a far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning
unrestrained by the young man's presence she threw up her mouth put her lips near the bars and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners
mrs d'urberville slept in a large fourpost bedstead hung with heavy damask curtains and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment where they flitted about freely at certain hours and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery
once while tess was at the window where the cages were ranged giving her lesson as usual she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed
the old lady was not present and turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains
thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the listener if such there were must have discovered her suspicion of his presence
she searched the curtains every morning after that but never found anybody within them
alec d'urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind
x   every village has its idiosyncrasy its constitution often its own code of morality
the levity of some of the younger women in and about trantridge was marked and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit who ruled the slopes in that vicinity
the place had also a more abiding defect it drank hard
the staple conversation on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money and smockfrocked arithmeticians leaning on their ploughs or hoes would enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime
the chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every saturday night when work was done to chaseborough a decayed markettown two or three miles distant and returning in the small hours of the next morning to spend sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the onceindependent inns
for a long time tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages
but under pressure from matrons not much older than herselffor a fieldman's wages being as high at twentyone as at forty marriage was early heretess at length consented to go
her first experience of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultryfarm all the week
she went again and again
being graceful and interesting standing moreover on the momentary threshold of womanhood her appearance drew down upon her some sly regards from loungers in the streets of chaseborough hence though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently she always searched for her fellows at nightfall to have the protection of their companionship homeward
this had gone on for a month or two when there came a saturday in september on which a fair and a market coincided and the pilgrims from trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account
tess's occupations made her late in setting out so that her comrades reached the town long before her
it was a fine september evening just before sunset when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike lines and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more solid objects except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it
through this lowlit mistiness tess walked leisurely along
she did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till she had reached the place by which time it was close upon dusk
her limited marketing was soon completed and then as usual she began to look about for some of the trantridge cottagers
at first she could not find them and she was informed that most of them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of a haytrusser and peatdealer who had transactions with their farm
he lived in an outoftheway nook of the townlet and in trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon mr d'urberville standing at a street corner
whatmy beauty
you here so late
he said
she told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward
i'll see you again said he over her shoulder as she went on down the back lane
approaching the haytrussers she could hear the fiddled notes of a reel proceeding from some building in the rear but no sound of dancing was audiblean exceptional state of things for these parts where as a rule the stamping drowned the music
the front door being open she could see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far as the shades of night would allow and nobody appearing to her knock she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence the sound had attracted her
it was a windowless erection used for storage and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance which at first tess thought to be illuminated smoke
but on drawing nearer she perceived that it was a cloud of dust lit by candles within the outhouse whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the doorway into the wide night of the garden
when she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up and down to the figure of the dance the silence of their footfalls arising from their being overshoe in scroffthat is to say the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene
through this floating fusty debris of peat and hay mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers and forming together a sort of vegetohuman pollen the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out
they coughed as they danced and laughed as they coughed
of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lightsthe indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphsa multiplicity of pans whirling a multiplicity of syrinxes lotis attempting to elude priapus and always failing
at intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air and the haze no longer veiling their features the demigods resolved themselves into the homely personalities of her own nextdoor neighbours
could trantridge in two or three short hours have metamorphosed itself thus madly
some sileni of the throng sat on benches and haytrusses by the wall and one of them recognized her
the maids don't think it respectable to dance at the flowerdeluce he explained
they don't like to let everybody see which be their fancymen
besides the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints begin to get greased
so we come here and send out for liquor
but when be any of you going home
asked tess with some anxiety
nowa'most directly
this is all but the last jig
she waited
the reel drew to a close and some of the party were in the mind of starting
but others would not and another dance was formed
this surely would end it thought tess
but it merged in yet another
she became restless and uneasy yet having waited so long it was necessary to wait longer on account of the fair the roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent and though not fearful of measurable dangers she feared the unknown
had she been near marlott she would have had less dread
don't ye be nervous my dear good soul expostulated between his coughs a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint
what's yer hurry
tomorrow is sunday thank god and we can sleep it off in churchtime
now have a turn with me
she did not abhor dancing but she was not going to dance here
the movement grew more passionate the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or with the back of the bow
but it did not matter the panting shapes spun onwards
they did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to previous ones
changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair and by this time every couple had been suitably matched
it was then that the ecstasy and the dream began in which emotion was the matter of the universe and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin
suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground a couple had fallen and lay in a mixed heap
the next couple unable to check its progress came toppling over the obstacle
an inner cloud of dust rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible
you shall catch it for this my gentleman when you get home
burst in female accents from the human heapthose of the unhappy partner of the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap she happened also to be his recently married wife in which assortment there was nothing unusual at trantridge as long as any affection remained between wedded couples and indeed it was not uncustomary in their later lives to avoid making odd lots of the single people between whom there might be a warm understanding
a loud laugh from behind tess's back in the shade of the garden united with the titter within the room
she looked round and saw the red coal of a cigar alec d'urberville was standing there alone
he beckoned to her and she reluctantly retreated towards him
well my beauty what are you doing here
she was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her trouble to himthat she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have their company home because the road at night was strange to her
but it seems they will never leave off and i really think i will wait no longer
certainly do not
i have only a saddlehorse here today but come to the flowerdeluce and i'll hire a trap and drive you home with me
tess though flattered had never quite got over her original mistrust of him and despite their tardiness she preferred to walk home with the workfolk
so she answered that she was much obliged to him but would not trouble him
i have said that i will wait for 'em and they will expect me to now
very well miss independence
please yourself  then i shall not hurry  my good lord what a kickup they are having there
he had not put himself forward into the light but some of them had perceived him and his presence led to a slight pause and a consideration of how the time was flying
as soon as he had relit a cigar and walked away the trantridge people began to collect themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms and prepared to leave in a body
their bundles and baskets were gathered up and half an hour later when the clockchime sounded a quarter past eleven they were straggling along the lane which led up the hill towards their homes
it was a threemile walk along a dry white road made whiter tonight by the light of the moon
tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock sometimes with this one sometimes with that that the fresh night air was producing staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too freely some of the more careless women also were wandering in their gaitto wit a dark virago car darch dubbed queen of spades till lately a favourite of d'urberville's nancy her sister nicknamed the queen of diamonds and the young married woman who had already tumbled down
yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye to themselves the case was different
they followed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a supporting medium possessed of original and profound thoughts themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other
they were as sublime as the moon and stars above them and the moon and stars were as ardent as they
tess however had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in her father's house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey
yet she stuck to the party for reasons above given
in the open highway they had progressed in scattered order but now their route was through a fieldgate and the foremost finding a difficulty in opening it they closed up together
this leading pedestrian was car the queen of spades who carried a wickerbasket containing her mother's groceries her own draperies and other purchases for the week
the basket being large and heavy car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo
wellwhatever is that acreeping down thy back car darch
said one of the group suddenly
all looked at car
her gown was a light cotton print and from the back of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance below her waist like a chinaman's queue
'tis her hair falling down said another
no it was not her hair it was a black stream of something oozing from her basket and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays of the moon
'tis treacle said an observant matron
treacle it was
car's poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet stuff
honey she had in plenty out of her own hives but treacle was what her soul desired and car had been about to give her a treat of surprise
hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within
by this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary appearance of car's back which irritated the dark queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available and independently of the help of the scoffers
she rushed excitedly into the field they were about to cross and flinging herself flat on her back upon the grass began to wipe her gown as well as she could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon her elbows
the laughter rang louder they clung to the gate to the posts rested on their staves in the weakness engendered by their convulsions at the spectacle of car
our heroine who had hitherto held her peace at this wild moment could not help joining in with the rest
it was a misfortunein more ways than one
no sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of tess among those of the other workpeople than a longsmouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness
she sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her dislike
how darest th' laugh at me hussy
she cried
i couldn't really help it when t'others did apologized tess still tittering
ah th'st think th' beest everybody dostn't because th' beest first favourite with he just now
but stop a bit my lady stop a bit
i'm as good as two of such
look herehere's at 'ee
to tess's horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her gownwhich for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only too glad to be free oftill she had bared her plump neck shoulders and arms to the moonshine under which they looked as luminous and beautiful as some praxitelean creation in their possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty countrygirl
she closed her fists and squared up at tess
indeed then i shall not fight
said the latter majestically and if i had know you was of that sort i wouldn't have so let myself down as to come with such a whorage as this is
the rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation from other quarters upon fair tess's unlucky head particularly from the queen of diamonds who having stood in the relations to d'urberville that car had also been suspected of united with the latter against the common enemy
several other women also chimed in with an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed
thereupon finding tess unfairly browbeaten the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by defending her but the result of that attempt was directly to increase the war
tess was indignant and ashamed
she no longer minded the loneliness of the way and the lateness of the hour her one object was to get away from the whole crew as soon as possible
she knew well enough that the better among them would repent of their passion next day
they were all now inside the field and she was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that screened the road and alec d'urberville looked round upon them
what the devil is all this row about workfolk
he asked
the explanation was not readily forthcoming and in truth he did not require any
having heard their voices while yet some way off he had ridden creepingly forward and learnt enough to satisfy himself
tess was standing apart from the rest near the gate
he bent over towards her
jump up behind me he whispered and we'll get shot of the screaming cats in a jiffy
she felt almost ready to faint so vivid was her sense of the crisis
at almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such proffered aid and company as she had refused them several times before and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to do otherwise
but coming as the invitation did at the particular juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them she abandoned herself to her impulse climbed the gate put her toe upon his instep and scrambled into the saddle behind him
the pair were speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious revellers became aware of what had happened
the queen of spades forgot the stain on her bodice and stood beside the queen of diamonds and the newmarried staggering young womanall with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the horse's tramp was diminishing into silence on the road
what be ye looking at
asked a man who had not observed the incident
hohoho
laughed dark car
heeheehee
laughed the tippling bride as she steadied herself on the arm of her fond husband
heuheuheu
laughed dark car's mother stroking her moustache as she explained laconically out of the fryingpan into the fire
then these children of the open air whom even excess of alcohol could scarce injure permanently betook themselves to the fieldpath and as they went there moved onward with them around the shadow of each one's head a circle of opalized light formed by the moon's rays upon the glistening sheet of dew
each pedestrian could see no halo but his or her own which never deserted the headshadow whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be but adhered to it and persistently beautified it till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the irradiation and the fumes of their breathing a component of the night's mist and the spirit of the scene and of the moonlight and of nature seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine
xi   the twain cantered along for some time without speech tess as she clung to him still panting in her triumph yet in other respects dubious
she had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he sometimes rose and felt no alarm on that score though her seat was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him
she begged him to slow the animal to a walk which alec accordingly did
neatly done was it not dear tess
he said by and by
yes
said she
i am sure i ought to be much obliged to you
and are you
she did not reply
tess why do you always dislike my kissing you
i supposebecause i don't love you
you are quite sure
i am angry with you sometimes
ah i half feared as much
nevertheless alec did not object to that confession
he knew that anything was better then frigidity
why haven't you told me when i have made you angry
you know very well why
because i cannot help myself here
i haven't offended you often by lovemaking
you have sometimes
how many times
you know as well as itoo many times
every time i have tried
she was silent and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance till a faint luminous fog which had hung in the hollows all the evening became general and enveloped them
it seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension rendering it more pervasive than in clear air
whether on this account or from absentmindedness or from sleepiness she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to trantridge branched from the highway and that her conductor had not taken the trantridge track
she was inexpressibly weary
she had risen at five o'clock every morning of that week had been on foot the whole of each day and on this evening had in addition walked the three miles to chaseborough waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking her impatience to start them preventing either she had then walked a mile of the way home and had undergone the excitement of the quarrel till with the slow progress of their steed it was now nearly one o'clock
only once however was she overcome by actual drowsiness
in that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him
d'urberville stopped the horse withdrew his feet from the stirrups turned sideways on the saddle and enclosed her waist with his arm to support her
this immediately put her on the defensive and with one of those sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push from her
in his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road the horse though a powerful one being fortunately the quietest he rode
that is devilish unkind
he said
i mean no harmonly to keep you from falling
she pondered suspiciously till thinking that this might after all be true she relented and said quite humbly i beg your pardon sir
i won't pardon you unless you show some confidence in me
good god
he burst out what am i to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you
for near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings eluded me and snubbed me and i won't stand it
i'll leave you tomorrow sir
no you will not leave me tomorrow
will you i ask once more show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm
come between us two and nobody else now
we know each other well and you know that i love you and think you the prettiest girl in the world which you are
mayn't i treat you as a lover
she drew a quick pettish breath of objection writhing uneasily on her seat looked far ahead and murmured i don't knowi wishhow can i say yes or no when  he settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired and tess expressed no further negative
thus they sidled slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable timefar longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from chaseborough even at this walking pace and that they were no longer on hard road but in a mere trackway
why where be we
she exclaimed
passing by a wood
a woodwhat wood
surely we are quite out of the road
a bit of the chasethe oldest wood in england
it is a lovely night and why should we not prolong our ride a little
how could you be so treacherous
said tess between archness and real dismay and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one though at the risk of slipping off herself
just when i've been putting such trust in you and obliging you to please you because i thought i had wronged you by that push
please set me down and let me walk home
you cannot walk home darling even if the air were clear
we are miles away from trantridge if i must tell you and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees
never mind that she coaxed
put me down i beg you
i don't mind where it is only let me get down sir please
very well then i willon one condition
having brought you here to this outoftheway place i feel myself responsible for your safeconduct home whatever you may yourself feel about it
as to your getting to trantridge without assistance it is quite impossible for to tell the truth dear owing to this fog which so disguises everything i don't quite know where we are myself
now if you will promise to wait beside the horse while i walk through the bushes till i come to some road or house and ascertain exactly our whereabouts i'll deposit you here willingly
when i come back i'll give you full directions and if you insist upon walking you may or you may rideat your pleasure
she accepted these terms and slid off on the near side though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss
he sprang down on the other side
i suppose i must hold the horse
said she
oh no it's not necessary replied alec patting the panting creature
he's had enough of it for tonight
he turned the horse's head into the bushes hitched him on to a bough and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves
now you sit there he said
the leaves have not got damp as yet
just give an eye to the horseit will be quite sufficient
he took a few steps away from her but returning said by the bye tess your father has a new cob today
somebody gave it to him
somebody
you
d'urberville nodded
o how very good of you that is
she exclaimed with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then
and the children have some toys
i didn't knowyou ever sent them anything
she murmured much moved
i almost wish you had notyes i almost wish it
why dear
ithampers me so
tessydon't you love me ever so little now
i'm grateful she reluctantly admitted
but i fear i do not the sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that beginning with one slow tear and then following with another she wept outright
don't cry dear dear one
now sit down here and wait till i come
she passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped and shivered slightly
are you cold
he asked
not verya little
he touched her with his fingers which sank into her as into down
you have only that puffy muslin dress onhow's that
it's my best summer one
'twas very warm when i started and i didn't know i was going to ride and that it would be night
nights grow chilly in september
let me see
he pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn and put it round her tenderly
that's itnow you'll feel warmer he continued
now my pretty rest there i shall soon be back again
having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees
she could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird and finally died away
with the setting of the moon the pale light lessened and tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her
in the meantime alec d'urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of the chase they were in
he had in fact ridden quite at random for over an hour taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her and giving far more attention to tess's moonlit person than to any wayside object
a little rest for the jaded animal being desirable he did not hasten his search for landmarks
a clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized which settled the question of their whereabouts
d'urberville thereupon turned back but by this time the moon had quite gone down and partly on account of the fog the chase was wrapped in thick darkness although morning was not far off
he was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him
roaming up and down round and round he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot
tess
said d'urberville
there was no answer
the obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves
everything else was blackness alike
d'urberville stooped and heard a gentle regular breathing
he knelt and bent lower till her breath warmed his face and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers
she was sleeping soundly and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears
darkness and silence ruled everywhere around
above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of the chase in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares
but might some say where was tess's guardian angel
where was the providence of her simple faith
perhaps like that other god of whom the ironical tishbite spoke he was talking or he was pursuing or he was in a journey or he was sleeping and not to be awaked
why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue sensitive as gossamer and practically blank as snow as yet there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus the wrong man the woman the wrong woman the man many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order
one may indeed admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe
doubtless some of tess d'urberville's mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time
but though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities it is scorned by average human nature and it therefore does not mend the matter
as tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way it was to be
there lay the pity of it
an immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at trantridge poultryfarm
end of phase the first      phase the second maiden no more    xii   the basket was heavy and the bundle was large but she lugged them along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material things
occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some gate or post and then giving the baggage another hitch upon her full round arm went steadily on again
it was a sunday morning in late october about four months after tess durbeyfield's arrival at trantridge and some few weeks subsequent to the night ride in the chase
the time was not long past daybreak and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the ridge towards which her face was setthe barrier of the vale wherein she had of late been a strangerwhich she would have to climb over to reach her birthplace
the ascent was gradual on this side and the soil and scenery differed much from those within blakemore vale
even the character and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference despite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway so that though less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at trantridge her native village had seemed a faraway spot
the fieldfolk shut in there traded northward and westward travelled courted and married northward and westward thought northward and westward those on this side mainly directed their energies and attention to the east and south
the incline was the same down which d'urberville had driven her so wildly on that day in june
tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond now halfveiled in mist
it was always beautiful from here it was terribly beautiful to tess today for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson
verily another girl than the simple one she had been at home was she who bowed by thought stood still here and turned to look behind her
she could not bear to look forward into the vale
ascending by the long white road that tess herself had just laboured up she saw a twowheeled vehicle beside which walked a man who held up his hand to attract her attention
she obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose and in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her
why did you slip away by stealth like this
said d'urberville with upbraiding breathlessness on a sunday morning too when people were all in bed
i only discovered it by accident and i have been driving like the deuce to overtake you
just look at the mare
why go off like this
you know that nobody wished to hinder your going
and how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot and encumber yourself with this heavy load
i have followed like a madman simply to drive you the rest of the distance if you won't come back
i shan't come back said she
i thought you wouldn'ti said so
well then put up your basket and let me help you on
she listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dogcart and stepped up and they sat side by side
she had no fear of him now and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay
d'urberville mechanically lit a cigar and the journey was continued with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the wayside
he had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when in the early summer they had driven in the opposite direction along the same road
but she had not and she sat now like a puppet replying to his remarks in monosyllables
after some miles they came in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of marlott stood
it was only then that her still face showed the least emotion a tear or two beginning to trickle down
what are you crying for
he coldly asked
i was only thinking that i was born over there murmured tess
wellwe must all be born somewhere
i wish i had never been bornthere or anywhere else
pooh
well if you didn't wish to come to trantridge why did you come
she did not reply
you didn't come for love of me that i'll swear
'tis quite true
if i had gone for love o' you if i had ever sincerely loved you if i loved you still i should not so loathe and hate myself for my weakness as i do now
  my eyes were dazed by you for a little and that was all
he shrugged his shoulders
she resumed  i didn't understand your meaning till it was too late
that's what every woman says
how can you dare to use such words
she cried turning impetuously upon him her eyes flashing as the latent spirit of which he was to see more some day awoke in her
my god
i could knock you out of the gig
did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel
very well he said laughing i am sorry to wound you
i did wrongi admit it
he dropped into some little bitterness as he continued only you needn't be so everlastingly flinging it in my face
i am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing
you know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again
you know you may clothe yourself with the best instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected as if you couldn't get a ribbon more than you earn
her lip lifted slightly though there was little scorn as a rule in her large and impulsive nature
i have said i will not take anything more from you and i will noti cannot
i should be your creature to go on doing that and i won't
one would think you were a princess from your manner in addition to a true and original d'urbervilleha
ha
well tess dear i can say no more
i suppose i am a bad fellowa damn bad fellow
i was born bad and i have lived bad and i shall die bad in all probability
but upon my lost soul i won't be bad towards you again tess
and if certain circumstances should ariseyou understandin which you are in the least need the least difficulty send me one line and you shall have by return whatever you require
i may not be at trantridgei am going to london for a timei can't stand the old woman
but all letters will be forwarded
she said that she did not wish him to drive her further and they stopped just under the clump of trees
d'urberville alighted and lifted her down bodily in his arms afterwards placing her articles on the ground beside her
she bowed to him slightly her eye just lingering in his and then she turned to take the parcels for departure
alec d'urberville removed his cigar bent towards her and said  you are not going to turn away like that dear
come
if you wish she answered indifferently
see how you've mastered me
she thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his and remained like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheekhalf perfunctorily half as if zest had not yet quite died out
her eyes vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did
now the other side for old acquaintance' sake
she turned her head in the same passive way as one might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser and he kissed the other side his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the mushrooms in the fields around
you don't give me your mouth and kiss me back
you never willingly do thatyou'll never love me i fear
i have said so often
it is true
i have never really and truly loved you and i think i never can
she added mournfully perhaps of all things a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now but i have honour enough left little as 'tis not to tell that lie
if i did love you i may have the best o' causes for letting you know it
but i don't
he emitted a laboured breath as if the scene were getting rather oppressive to his heart or to his conscience or to his gentility
well you are absurdly melancholy tess
i have no reason for flattering you now and i can say plainly that you need not be so sad
you can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts gentle or simple i say it to you as a practical man and wellwisher
if you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before it fades  and yet tess will you come back to me
upon my soul i don't like to let you go like this
never never
i made up my mind as soon as i sawwhat i ought to have seen sooner and i won't come
then good morning my four months' cousingoodbye
he leapt up lightly arranged the reins and was gone between the tall redberried hedges
tess did not look after him but slowly wound along the crooked lane
it was still early and though the sun's lower limb was just free of the hill his rays ungenial and peering addressed the eye rather than the touch as yet
there was not a human soul near
sad october and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane
as she walked however some footsteps approached behind her the footsteps of a man and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said good morning before she had been long aware of his propinquity
he appeared to be an artisan of some sort and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand
he asked in a businesslike manner if he should take her basket which she permitted him to do walking beside him
it is early to be astir this sabbath morn
he said cheerfully
yes said tess
when most people are at rest from their week's work
she also assented to this
though i do more real work today than all the week besides
do you
all the week i work for the glory of man and on sunday for the glory of god
that's more real than the otherhey
i have a little to do here at this stile
the man turned as he spoke to an opening at the roadside leading into a pasture
if you'll wait a moment he added i shall not be long
as he had her basket she could not well do otherwise and she waited observing him
he set down her basket and the tin pot and stirring the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile placing a comma after each word as if to give pause while that word was driven well home to the reader's heart         thy damnation slumbereth not
 pet
ii

against the peaceful landscape the pale decaying tints of the copses the blue air of the horizon and the lichened stileboards these staring vermilion words shone forth
they seemed to shout themselves out and make the atmosphere ring
some people might have cried alas poor theology
at the hideous defacementthe last grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time
but the words entered tess with accusatory horror
it was as if this man had known her recent history yet he was a total stranger
having finished his text he picked up her basket and she mechanically resumed her walk beside him
do you believe what you paint
she asked in low tones
believe that tex
do i believe in my own existence
but said she tremulously suppose your sin was not of your own seeking
he shook his head
i cannot split hairs on that burning query he said
i have walked hundreds of miles this past summer painting these texes on every wall gate and stile the length and breadth of this district
i leave their application to the hearts of the people who read 'em
i think they are horrible said tess
crushing
killing
that's what they are meant to be
he replied in a trade voice
but you should read my hottest onesthem i kips for slums and seaports
they'd make ye wriggle
not but what this is a very good tex for rural districts
  ahthere's a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn standing to waste
i must put one thereone that it will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed
will ye wait missy
no said she and taking her basket tess trudged on
a little way forward she turned her head
the old gray wall began to advertise a similar fiery lettering to the first with a strange and unwonted mien as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to perform
it was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through         thou shalt not commit   her cheerful friend saw her looking stopped his brush and shouted  if you want to ask for edification on these things of moment there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charitysermon today in the parish you are going tomr clare of emminster
i'm not of his persuasion now but he's a good man and he'll expound as well as any parson i know
'twas he began the work in me
but tess did not answer she throbbingly resumed her walk her eyes fixed on the ground
poohi don't believe god said such things
she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away
a plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney the sight of which made her heart ache
the aspect of the interior when she reached it made her heart ache more
her mother who had just come down stairs turned to greet her from the fireplace where she was kindling barkedoak twigs under the breakfast kettle
the young children were still above as was also her father it being sunday morning when he felt justified in lying an additional halfhour
wellmy dear tess
exclaimed her surprised mother jumping up and kissing the girl
how be ye
i didn't see you till you was in upon me
have you come home to be married
no i have not come for that mother
then for a holiday
yesfor a holiday for a long holiday said tess
what isn't your cousin going to do the handsome thing
he's not my cousin and he's not going to marry me
her mother eyed her narrowly
come you have not told me all she said
then tess went up to her mother put her face upon joan's neck and told
and yet th'st not got him to marry 'ee
reiterated her mother
any woman would have done it but you after that
perhaps any woman would except me
it would have been something like a story to come back with if you had
continued mrs durbeyfield ready to burst into tears of vexation
after all the talk about you and him which has reached us here who would have expected it to end like this
why didn't ye think of doing some good for your family instead o' thinking only of yourself
see how i've got to teave and slave and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a drippingpan
i did hope for something to come out o' this
to see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago
see what he has given usall as we thought because we were his kin
but if he's not it must have been done because of his love for 'ee
and yet you've not got him to marry
get alec d'urberville in the mind to marry her
he marry her
on matrimony he had never once said a word
and what if he had
how a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say
but her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man
perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances unlucky unaccountable but there it was and this as she had said was what made her detest herself
she had never wholly cared for him she did not at all care for him now
she had dreaded him winced before him succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness then temporarily blinded by his ardent manners had been stirred to confused surrender awhile had suddenly despised and disliked him and had run away
that was all
hate him she did not quite but he was dust and ashes to her and even for her name's sake she scarcely wished to marry him
you ought to have been more careful if you didn't mean to get him to make you his wife
o mother my mother
cried the agonized girl turning passionately upon her parent as if her poor heart would break
how could i be expected to know
i was a child when i left this house four months ago
why didn't you tell me there was danger in menfolk
why didn't you warn me
ladies know what to fend hands against because they read novels that tell them of these tricks but i never had the chance o' learning in that way and you did not help me
her mother was subdued
i thought if i spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead to you would be hontish wi' him and lose your chance she murmured wiping her eyes with her apron
well we must make the best of it i suppose
'tis nater after all and what do please god
xiii   the event of tess durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus kinsfolk was rumoured abroad if rumour be not too large a word for a space of a square mile
in the afternoon several young girls of marlott former schoolfellows and acquaintances of tess called to see her arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed as became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest as they supposed and sat round the room looking at her with great curiosity
for the fact that it was this said thirtyfirst cousin mr d'urberville who had fallen in love with her a gentleman not altogether local whose reputation as a reckless gallant and heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries of trantridge lent tess's supposed position by its fearsomeness a far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous
their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her back was turned  how pretty she is and how that best frock do set her off
i believe it cost an immense deal and that it was a gift from him
tess who was reaching up to get the teathings from the cornercupboard did not hear these commentaries
if she had heard them she might soon have set her friends right on the matter
but her mother heard and joan's simple vanity having been denied the hope of a dashing marriage fed itself as well as it could upon the sensation of a dashing flirtation
upon the whole she felt gratified even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should involve her daughter's reputation it might end in marriage yet and in the warmth of her responsiveness to their admiration she invited her visitors to stay to tea
their chatter their laughter their goodhumoured innuendoes above all their flashes and flickerings of envy revived tess's spirits also and as the evening wore on she caught the infection of their excitement and grew almost gay
the marble hardness left her face she moved with something of her old bounding step and flushed in all her young beauty
at moments in spite of thought she would reply to their inquiries with a manner of superiority as if recognizing that her experiences in the field of courtship had indeed been slightly enviable
but so far was she from being in the words of robert south in love with her own ruin that the illusion was transient as lightning cold reason came back to mock her spasmodic weakness the ghastliness of her momentary pride would convict her and recall her to reserved listlessness again
and the despondency of the next morning's dawn when it was no longer sunday but monday and no best clothes and the laughing visitors were gone and she awoke alone in her old bed the innocent younger children breathing softly around her
in place of the excitement of her return and the interest it had inspired she saw before her a long and stony highway which she had to tread without aid and with little sympathy
her depression was then terrible and she could have hidden herself in a tomb
in the course of a few weeks tess revived sufficiently to show herself so far as was necessary to get to church one sunday morning
she liked to hear the chantingsuch as it wasand the old psalms and to join in the morning hymn
that innate love of melody which she had inherited from her balladsinging mother gave the simplest music a power over her which could wellnigh drag her heart out of her bosom at times
to be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own and to escape the gallantries of the young men she set out before the chiming began and took a back seat under the gallery close to the lumber where only old men and women came and where the bier stood on end among the churchyard tools
parishioners dropped in by twos and threes deposited themselves in rows before her rested threequarters of a minute on their foreheads as if they were praying though they were not then sat up and looked around
when the chants came on one of her favourites happened to be chosen among the restthe old double chant langdonbut she did not know what it was called though she would much have liked to know
she thought without exactly wording the thought how strange and godlike was a composer's power who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion which he alone had felt at first a girl like her who had never heard of his name and never would have a clue to his personality
the people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded and at last observing her they whispered to each other
she knew what their whispers were about grew sick at heart and felt that she could come to church no more
the bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever
here under her few square yards of thatch she watched winds and snows and rains gorgeous sunsets and successive moons at their full
so close kept she that at length almost everybody thought she had gone away
the only exercise that tess took at this time was after dark and it was then when out in the woods that she seemed least solitary
she knew how to hit to a hair'sbreadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other leaving absolute mental liberty
it is then that the plight of being alive becomes attenuated to its least possible dimensions
she had no fear of the shadows her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankindor rather that cold accretion called the world which so terrible in the mass is so unformidable even pitiable in its units
on these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece with the element she moved in
her flexuous and stealthy figure became an integral part of the scene
at times her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part of her own story
rather they became a part of it for the world is only a psychological phenomenon and what they seemed they were
the midnight airs and gusts moaning amongst the tightlywrapped buds and bark of the winter twigs were formulae of bitter reproach
a wet day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the god of her childhood and could not comprehend as any other
but this encompassment of her own characterization based on shreds of convention peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her was a sorry and mistaken creation of tess's fancya cloud of moral hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason
it was they that were out of harmony with the actual world not she
walking among the sleeping birds in the hedges watching the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren or standing under a pheasantladen bough she looked upon herself as a figure of guilt intruding into the haunts of innocence
but all the while she was making a distinction where there was no difference
feeling herself in antagonism she was quite in accord
she had been made to break an accepted social law but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly
xiv   it was a hazy sunrise in august
the denser nocturnal vapours attacked by the warm beams were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces within hollows and coverts where they waited till they should be dried away to nothing
the sun on account of the mist had a curious sentient personal look demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression
his present aspect coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene explained the oldtime heliolatries in a moment
one could feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky
the luminary was a goldenhaired beaming mildeyed godlike creature gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with interest for him
his light a little later broke though chinks of cottage shutters throwing stripes like redhot pokers upon cupboards chests of drawers and other furniture within and awakening harvesters who were not already astir
but of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms of painted wood which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield hard by marlott village
they with two others below formed the revolving maltese cross of the reapingmachine which had been brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day
the paint with which they were smeared intensified in hue by the sunlight imparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire
the field had already been opened that is to say a lane a few feet wide had been handcut through the wheat along the whole circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and machine
two groups one of men and lads the other of women had come down the lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedgetop struck the west hedge midway so that the heads of the groups were enjoying sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn
they disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest fieldgate
presently there arose from within a ticking like the lovemaking of the grasshopper
the machine had begun and a moving concatenation of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the gate a driver sitting  upon one of the hauling horses and an attendant on the seat of the implement
along one side of the field the whole wain went the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly till it passed down the hill quite out of sight
in a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same equable pace the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble then the bright arms and then the whole machine
the narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each circuit and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as the morning wore on
rabbits hares snakes rats mice retreated inwards as into a fastness unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness they were huddled together friends and foes till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper and they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters
the reapingmachine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf and upon these the active binders in the rear laid their handsmainly women but some of them men in print shirts and trousers supported round their waists by leather straps rendering useless the two buttons behind which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back
but those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of binders by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature and is not merely an object set down therein as at ordinary times
a fieldman is a personality afield a fieldwoman is a portion of the field she had somehow lost her own margin imbibed the essence of her surrounding and assimilated herself with it
the womenor rather girls for they were mostly youngwore drawn cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun and gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble
there was one wearing a pale pink jacket another in a creamcoloured tightsleeved gown another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reapingmachine and others older in the brownrough wropper or overallthe oldestablished and most appropriate dress of the fieldwoman which the young ones were abandoning
this morning the eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket she being the most flexuous and finelydrawn figure of them all
but her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she binds though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet
perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it though the other women often gaze around them
her binding proceeds with clocklike monotony
from the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even
then stooping low she moves forward gathering the corn with both hands against her knees and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover
she brings the ends of the bond together and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze
a bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds
at intervals she stands up to rest and to retie her disarranged apron or to pull her bonnet straight
then one can see the oval face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging tresses which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall against
the cheeks are paler the teeth more regular the red lips thinner than is usual in a countrybred girl
it is tess durbeyfield otherwise d'urberville somewhat changedthe same but not the same at the present stage of her existence living as a stranger and an alien here though it was no strange land that she was in
after a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake outdoor work in her native village the busiest season of the year in the agricultural world having arrived and nothing that she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in the fields
the movements of the other women were more or less similar to tess's the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at the completion of a sheaf by each every one placing her sheaf on end against those of the rest till a shock or stitch as it was here called of ten or a dozen was formed
they went to breakfast and came again and the work proceeded as before
as the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might have noticed that every now and then tess's glance flitted wistfully to the brow of the hill though she did not pause in her sheafing
on the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children of ages ranging from six to fourteen rose over the stubbly convexity of the hill
the face of tess flushed slightly but still she did not pause
the eldest of the comers a girl who wore a triangular shawl its corner draggling on the stubble carried in her arms what at first sight seemed to be a doll but proved to be an infant in long clothes
another brought some lunch
the harvesters ceased working took their provisions and sat down against one of the shocks
here they fell to the men plying a stone jar freely and passing round a cup
tess durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours
she sat down at the end of the shock her face turned somewhat away from her companions
when she had deposited herself a man in a rabbitskin cap and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink
but she did not accept his offer
as soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl her sister and took the baby of her who glad to be relieved of the burden went away to the next shock and joined the other children playing there
tess with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement and with a still rising colour unfastened her frock and began suckling the child
the men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the other end of the field some of them beginning to smoke one with absentminded fondness regretfully stroking the jar that would no longer yield a stream
all the women but tess fell into animated talk and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair
when the infant had taken its fill the young mother sat it upright in her lap and looking into the far distance dandled it with a gloomy indifference that was almost dislike then all of a sudden she fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times as if she could never leave off the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which strangely combined passionateness with contempt
she's fond of that there child though she mid pretend to hate en and say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard observed the woman in the red petticoat
she'll soon leave off saying that replied the one in buff
lord 'tis wonderful what a body can get used to o' that sort in time
a little more than persuading had to do wi' the coming o't i reckon
there were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in the chase and it mid ha' gone hard wi' a certain party if folks had come along
well a little more or a little less 'twas a thousand pities that it should have happened to she of all others
but 'tis always the comeliest
the plain ones be as safe as churcheshey jenny
the speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not illdefined as plain
it was a thousand pities indeed it was impossible for even an enemy to feel otherwise on looking at tess as she sat there with her flowerlike mouth and large tender eyes neither black nor blue nor grey nor violet rather all those shades together and a hundred others which could be seen if one looked into their irisesshade behind shadetint beyond tintaround pupils that had no bottom an almost standard woman but for the slight incautiousness of character inherited from her race
a resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the fields this week for the first time during many months
after wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that lonely inexperience could devise common sense had illuminated her
she felt that she would do well to be useful againto taste anew sweet independence at any price
the past was past whatever it had been it was no more at hand
whatever its consequences time would close over them they would all in a few years be as if they had never been and she herself grassed down and forgotten
meanwhile the trees were just as green as before the birds sang and the sun shone as clearly now as ever
the familiar surroundings had not darkened because of her grief nor sickened because of her pain
she might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundlythe thought of the world's concern at her situationwas founded on an illusion
she was not an existence an experience a passion a structure of sensations to anybody but herself
to all humankind besides tess was only a passing thought
even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought
if she made herself miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to themah she makes herself unhappy
if she tried to be cheerful to dismiss all care to take pleasure in the daylight the flowers the baby she could only be this idea to themah she bears it very well
moreover alone in a desert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her
not greatly
if she could have been but just created to discover herself as a spouseless mother with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child would the position have caused her to despair
no she would have taken it calmly and found pleasure therein
most of the misery had been generated by her conventional aspect and not by her innate sensations
whatever tess's reasoning some spirit had induced her to dress herself up neatly as she had formerly done and come out into the fields harvesthands being greatly in demand just then
this was why she had borne herself with dignity and had looked people calmly in the face at times even when holding the baby in her arms
the harvestmen rose from the shock of corn and stretched their limbs and extinguished their pipes
the horses which had been unharnessed and fed were again attached to the scarlet machine
tess having quickly eaten her own meal beckoned to her eldest sister to come and take away the baby fastened her dress put on the buff gloves again and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last completed sheaf for the tying of the next
in the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were continued tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters
then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons in the company of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards its face resembling the outworn goldleaf halo of some wormeaten tuscan saint
tess's female companions sang songs and showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood and came back a changed state
there are counterpoises and compensations in life and the event which had made of her a social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage in the village to many
their friendliness won her still farther away from herself their lively spirits were contagious and she became almost gay
but now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on the natural side of her which knew no social law
when she reached home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill since the afternoon
some such collapse had been probable so tender and puny was its frame but the event came as a shock nevertheless
the baby's offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girlmother her soul's desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child
however it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured
and when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the child's simple loss
her baby had not been baptized
tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done burn she must and there was an end of it
like all village girls she was well grounded in the holy scriptures and had dutifully studied the histories of aholah and aholibah and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom
but when the same question arose with regard to the baby it had a very different colour
her darling was about to die and no salvation
it was nearly bedtime but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might send for the parson
the moment happened to be one at which her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest and his sensitiveness to the smudge which tess had set upon that nobility most pronounced for he had just returned from his weekly booze at rolliver's inn
no parson should come inside his door he declared prying into his affairs just then when by her shame it had become more necessary than ever to hide them
he locked the door and put the key in his pocket
the household went to bed and distressed beyond measure tess retired also
she was continually waking as she lay and in the middle of the night found that the baby was still worse
it was obviously dyingquietly and painlessly but none the less surely
in her misery she rocked herself upon the bed
the clock struck the solemn hour of one that hour when fancy stalks outside reason and malignant possibilities stand rockfirm as facts
she thought of the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell as its double doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy saw the archfiend tossing it with his threepronged fork like the one they used for heating the oven on baking days to which picture she added many other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this christian country
the lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp with perspiration and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart
the infant's breathing grew more difficult and the mother's mental tension increased
it was useless to devour the little thing with kisses she could stay in bed no longer and walked feverishly about the room
o merciful god have pity have pity upon my poor baby
she cried
heap as much anger as you want to upon me and welcome but pity the child
she leant against the chest of drawers and murmured incoherent supplications for a long while till she suddenly started up
ah
perhaps baby can be saved
perhaps it will be just the same
she spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have shone in the gloom surrounding her
she lit a candle and went to a second and a third bed under the wall where she awoke her young sisters and brothers all of whom occupied the same room
pulling out the washingstand so that she could get behind it she poured some water from a jug and made them kneel around putting their hands together with fingers exactly vertical
while the children scarcely awake awestricken at her manner their eyes growing larger and larger remained in this position she took the baby from her beda child's childso immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to endow its producer with the maternal title
tess then stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin the next sister held the prayerbook open before her as the clerk at church held it before the parson and thus the girl set about baptizing her child
her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long white nightgown a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight down her back to her waist
the kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealedthe stubble scratches upon her wrists and the weariness of her eyesher high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty with a touch of dignity which was almost regal
the little ones kneeling round their sleepy eyes blinking and red awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active
the most impressed of them said  be you really going to christen him tess
the girlmother replied in a grave affirmative
what's his name going to be
she had not thought of that but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service and now she pronounced it  sorrow i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
she sprinkled the water and there was silence
say 'amen' children
the tiny voices piped in obedient response amen
tess went on  we receive this childand so forthand do sign him with the sign of the cross
here she dipped her hand into the basin and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin the world and the devil and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life's end
she duly went on with the lord's prayer the children lisping it after her in a thin gnatlike wail till at the conclusion raising their voices to clerk's pitch they again piped into silence amen
then their sister with much augmented confidence in the efficacy of the sacrament poured forth from the bottom of her heart the thanksgiving that follows uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the stoptdiapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in her speech and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her
the ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her it set upon her face a glowing irradiation and brought a red spot into the middle of each cheek while the miniature candleflame inverted in her eyepupils shone like a diamond
the children gazed up at her with more and more reverence and no longer had a will for questioning
she did not look like sissy to them now but as a being large towering and awfula divine personage with whom they had nothing in common
poor sorrow's campaign against sin the world and the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancyluckily perhaps for himself considering his beginnings
in the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant breathed his last and when the other children awoke they cried bitterly and begged sissy to have another pretty baby
the calmness which had possessed tess since the christening remained with her in the infant's loss
in the daylight indeed she felt her terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated whether well founded or not she had no uneasiness now reasoning that if providence would not ratify such an act of approximation she for one did not value the kind of heaven lost by the irregularityeither for herself or for her child
so passed away sorrow the undesiredthat intrusive creature that bastard gift of shameless nature who respects not the social law a waif to whom eternal time had been a matter of days merely who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were to whom the cottage interior was the universe the week's weather climate newborn babyhood human existence and the instinct to suck human knowledge
tess who mused on the christening a good deal wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a christian burial for the child
nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish and he was a newcomer and did not know her
she went to his house after dusk and stood by the gate but could not summon courage to go in
the enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him coming homeward as she turned away
in the gloom she did not mind speaking freely
i should like to ask you something sir
he expressed his willingness to listen and she told the story of the baby's illness and the extemporized ordinance
and now sir she added earnestly can you tell me thiswill it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him
having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves he was disposed to say no
yet the dignity of the girl the strange tenderness in her voice combined to affect his nobler impulsesor rather those that he had left in him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism
the man and the ecclesiastic fought within him and the victory fell to the man
my dear girl he said it will be just the same
then will you give him a christian burial
she asked quickly
the vicar felt himself cornered
hearing of the baby's illness he had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite and unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from tess's father and not from tess he could not allow the plea of necessity for its irregular administration
ahthat's another matter he said
another matterwhy
asked tess rather warmly
welli would willingly do so if only we two were concerned
but i must notfor certain reasons
just for once sir
really i must not
o sir
she seized his hand as she spoke
he withdrew it shaking his head
then i don't like you
she burst out and i'll never come to your church no more
don't talk so rashly
perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don't
  will it be just the same
don't for god's sake speak as saint to sinner but as you yourself to me myselfpoor me
how the vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman's power to tell though not to excuse
somewhat moved he said in this case also  it will be just the same
so the baby was carried in a small deal box under an ancient woman's shawl to the churchyard that night and buried by lanternlight at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton in that shabby corner of god's allotment where he lets the nettles grow and where all unbaptized infants notorious drunkards suicides and others of the conjecturally damned are laid
in spite of the untoward surroundings however tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string and having bound it with flowers she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive
what matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words keelwell's marmalade
the eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things
xv   by experience says roger ascham we find out a short way by a long wandering
not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then
tess durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind
at last she had learned what to do but who would now accept her doing
if before going to the d'urbervilles' she had vigorously moved under the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the world in general no doubt she would never have been imposed on
but it had not been in tess's powernor is it in anybody's powerto feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them
sheand how many moremight have ironically said to god with saint augustine thou hast counselled a better course than thou hast permitted
she remained at her father's house during the winter months plucking fowls or cramming turkeys and geese or making clothes for her sisters and brothers out of some finery which d'urberville had given her and she had put by with contempt
apply to him she would not
but she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to be working hard
she philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year the disastrous night of her undoing at trantridge with its dark background of the chase also the dates of the baby's birth and death also her own birthday and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share
she suddenly thought one afternoon when looking in the glass at her fairness that there was yet another date of greater importance to her than those that of her own death when all these charms would have disappeared a day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year giving no sign or sound when she annually passed over it but not the less surely there
when was it
why did she not feel the chill of each yearly encounter with such a cold relation
she had jeremy taylor's thought that some time in the future those who had known her would say it is the th the day that poor tess durbeyfield died and there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement
of that day doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages she did not know the place in month week season or year
almost at a leap tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman
symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face and a note of tragedy at times into her voice
her eyes grew larger and more eloquent
she became what would have been called a fine creature her aspect was fair and arresting her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize
but for the world's opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education
she had held so aloof of late that her trouble never generally known was nearly forgotten in marlott
but it became evident to her that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the collapse of her family's attempt to claim kinand through her even closer unionwith the rich d'urbervilles
at least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen consciousness of it
yet even now tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still warm within her she might be happy in some nook which had no memories
to escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to annihilate it and to do that she would have to get away
was once lost always lost really true of chastity
she would ask herself
she might prove it false if she could veil bygones
the recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone
she waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure
a particularly fine spring came round and the stir of germination was almost audible in the buds it moved her as it moved the wild animals and made her passionate to go
at last one day in early may a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother's to whom she had addressed inquiries long beforea person whom she had never seenthat a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairyhouse many miles to the southward and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the summer months
it was not quite so far off as could have been wished but it was probably far enough her radius of movement and repute having been so small
to persons of limited spheres miles are as geographical degrees parishes as counties counties as provinces and kingdoms
on one point she was resolved there should be no more d'urberville aircastles in the dreams and deeds of her new life
she would be the dairymaid tess and nothing more
her mother knew tess's feeling on this point so well though no words had passed between them on the subject that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now
yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her forefathers' country for they were not blakemore men though her mother was blakemore to the bone
the dairy called talbothays for which she was bound stood not remotely from some of the former estates of the d'urbervilles near the great family vaults of her granddames and their powerful husbands
she would be able to look at them and think not only that d'urberville like babylon had fallen but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as silently
all the while she wondered if any strange good thing might come of her being in her ancestral land and some spirit within her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs
it was unexpected youth surging up anew after its temporary check and bringing with it hope and the invincible instinct towards selfdelight
end of phase the second      phase the third the rally    xvi   on a thymescented birdhatching morning in may between two and three years after the return from trantridgesilent reconstructive years for tess durbeyfieldshe left her home for the second time
having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later she started in a hired trap for the little town of stourcastle through which it was necessary to pass on her journey now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring
on the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at marlott and her father's house although she had been so anxious to get away
her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as heretofore with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness although she would be far off and they deprived of her smile
in a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure
this leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example
she went through stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction of highways where she could await a carrier's van that ran to the southwest for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it
while waiting however there came along a farmer in his spring cart driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue
though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance
he was going to weatherbury and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of casterbridge
tess did not stop at weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her
thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the lowlying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day's pilgrimage
tess had never before visited this part of the country and yet she felt akin to the landscape
not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of kingsberein the church of which parish the bones of her ancestorsher useless ancestorslay entombed
she had no admiration for them now she almost hated them for the dance they had led her not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon
poohi have as much of mother as father in me
she said
all my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid
the journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of egdon when she reached them was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated the distance being actually but a few miles
it was two hours owing to sundry wrong turnings ere she found herself on a summit commanding the longsoughtfor vale the valley of the great dairies the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness and were produced more profusely if less delicately than at her homethe verdant plain so well watered by the river var or froom
it was intrinsically different from the vale of little dairies blackmoor vale which save during her disastrous sojourn at trantridge she had exclusively known till now
the world was drawn to a larger pattern here
the enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten the farmsteads were more extended the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout there only families
these myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before
the green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by van alsloot or sallaert with burghers
the ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight which the whitecoated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling even at the distant elevation on which she stood
the bird'seye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful perhaps as that other one which she knew so well yet it was more cheering
it lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale and its heavy soils and scents the new air was clear bracing ethereal
the river itself which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies flowed not like the streams in blackmoor
those were slow silent often turbid flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares
the froom waters were clear as the pure river of life shown to the evangelist rapid as the shadow of a cloud with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long
there the waterflower was the lily the crowfoot here
either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her sent up her spirits wonderfully
her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind
she heard a pleasant voice in every breeze and in every bird's note seemed to lurk a joy
her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness according as the thoughts were gay or grave
one day she was pink and flawless another pale and tragical
when she was pink she was feeling less than when pale her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty
it was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind
the irresistible universal automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure somewhere which pervades all life from the meanest to the highest had at length mastered tess
being even now only a young woman of twenty one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing it was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation
and thus her spirits and her thankfulness and her hopes rose higher and higher
she tried several ballads but found them inadequate till recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge she chanted o ye sun and moon  o ye stars  ye green things upon the earth  ye fowls of the air  beasts and cattle  children of men  bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever
she suddenly stopped and murmured but perhaps i don't quite know the lord as yet
and probably the halfunconscious rhapsody was a fetishistic utterance in a monotheistic setting women whose chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor nature retain in their souls far more of the pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date
however tess found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old benedicite that she had lisped from infancy and it was enough
such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the durbeyfield temperament
tess really wished to walk uprightly while her father did nothing of the kind but she resembled him in being content with immediate and small achievements and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful d'urbervilles were now
there was it might be said the energy of her mother's unexpended family as well as the natural energy of tess's years rekindled after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time
let the truth be toldwomen do as a rule live through such humiliations and regain their spirits and again look about them with an interested eye
while there's life there's hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to the betrayed as some amiable theorists would have us believe
tess durbeyfield then in good heart and full of zest for life descended the egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her pilgrimage
the marked difference in the final particular between the rival vales now showed itself
the secret of blackmoor was best discovered from the heights around to read aright the valley before her it was necessary to descend into its midst
when tess had accomplished this feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level which stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach
the river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal land and now exhausted aged and attenuated lay serpentining along through the midst of its former spoils
not quite sure of her direction tess stood still upon the hemmed expanse of verdant flatness like a fly on a billiardtable of indefinite length and of no more consequence to the surroundings than that fly
the sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron which after descending to the ground not far from her path stood with neck erect looking at her
suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and repeated callwaow
waow
waow
from the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by contagion accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog
it was not the expression of the valley's consciousness that beautiful tess had arrived but the ordinary announcement of milkingtimehalfpast four o'clock when the dairymen set about getting in the cows
the red and white herd nearest at hand which had been phlegmatically waiting for the call now trooped towards the steading in the background their great bags of milk swinging under them as they walked
tess followed slowly in their rear and entered the barton by the open gate through which they had entered before her
long thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure their slopes encrusted with vivid green moss and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone years now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its profundity
between the post were ranged the milchers each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks down the centre of which a switch moved pendulumwise while the sun lowering itself behind this patient row threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall
thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall copied them as diligently as it had copied olympian shapes on marble faades long ago or the outline of alexander caesar and the pharaohs
they were the less restful cows that were stalled
those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting nowall prime milchers such as were seldom seen out of this valley and not always within it nourished by the succulent feed which the watermeads supplied at this prime season of the year
those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display
their largeveined udders hung ponderous as sandbags the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground
xvii   the dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairyhouse with the arrival of the cows from the meads the maids walking in pattens not on account of the weather but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton
each girl sat down on her threelegged stool her face sideways her right cheek resting against the cow and looked musingly along the animal's flank at tess as she approached
the male milkers with hatbrims turned down resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground did not observe her
one of these was a sturdy middleaged manwhose long white pinner was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspectthe masterdairyman of whom she was in quest his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days and on the seventh as a man in shining broadcloth in his family pew at church being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme                dairyman dick              all the week      on sundays mister richard crick
seeing tess standing at gaze he went across to her
the majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time but it happened that mr crick was glad to get a new handfor the days were busy ones nowand he received her warmly inquiring for her mother and the rest of the familythough this as a matter of form merely for in reality he had not been aware of mrs durbeyfield's existence till apprised of the fact by a brief businessletter about tess
ohay as a lad i knowed your part o' the country very well he said terminatively
though i've never been there since
and a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here but is dead and gone long ago told me that a family of some such name as yours in blackmoor vale came originally from these parts and that 'twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earththough the new generations didn't know it
but lord i took no notice of the old woman's ramblings not i
oh noit is nothing said tess
then the talk was of business only
you can milk 'em clean my maidy
i don't want my cows going azew at this time o' year
she reassured him on that point and he surveyed her up and down
she had been staying indoors a good deal and her complexion had grown delicate
quite sure you can stand it
'tis comfortable enough here for rough folk but we don't live in a cowcumber frame
she declared that she could stand it and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over
well i suppose you'll want a dish o' tay or victuals of some sort hey
not yet
well do as ye like about it
but faith if 'twas i i should be as dry as a kex wi' travelling so far
i'll begin milking now to get my hand in said tess
she drank a little milk as temporary refreshmentto the surpriseindeed slight contemptof dairyman crick to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage
oh if ye can swaller that be it so he said indifferently while holding up the pail that she sipped from
'tis what i hain't touched for yearsnot i  rot the stuff it would lie in my innerds like lead
you can try your hand upon she he pursued nodding to the nearest cow
not but what she do milk rather hard
we've hard ones and we've easy ones like other folks
however you'll find out that soon enough
when tess had changed her bonnet for a hood and was really on her stool under the cow and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future
the conviction bred serenity her pulse slowed and she was able to look about her
the milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids the men operating on the hardteated animals the maids on the kindlier natures
it was a large dairy
there were nearly a hundred milchers under crick's management all told and of the herd the masterdairyman milked six or eight with his own hands unless away from home
these were the cows that milked hardest of all for his journeymilkmen being more or less casually hired he would not entrust this halfdozen to their treatment lest from indifference they should not milk them fully nor to the maids lest they should fail in the same way for lack of fingergrip with the result that in course of time the cows would go azewthat is dry up
it was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious but that with the decline of demand there came decline and ultimately cessation of supply
after tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milkjets into the numerous pails except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still
the only movements were those of the milkers' hands up and down and the swing of the cows' tails
thus they all worked on encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valleya level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten and no doubt differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now
to my thinking said the dairyman rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off snatching up his threelegged stool in one hand and the pail in the other and moving on to the next hardyielder in his vicinity to my thinking the cows don't gie down their milk today as usual
upon my life if winker do begin keeping back like this she'll not be worth going under by midsummer
'tis because there's a new hand come among us said jonathan kail
i've noticed such things afore
to be sure
it may be so
i didn't think o't
i've been told that it goes up into their horns at such times said a dairymaid
well as to going up into their horns replied dairyman crick dubiously as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical possibilities i couldn't say i certainly could not
but as nott cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones i don't quite agree to it
do ye know that riddle about the nott cows jonathan
why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned
i don't
interposed the milkmaid why do they
because there bain't so many of 'em said the dairyman
howsomever these gam'sters do certainly keep back their milk today
folks we must lift up a stave or twothat's the only cure for't
songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield and the band of milkers at this request burst into melodyin purely businesslike tones it is true and with no great spontaneity the result according to their own belief being a decided improvement during the song's continuance
when they had gone through fourteen or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around him one of the male milkers said  i wish singing on the stoop didn't use up so much of a man's wind
you should get your harp sir not but what a fiddle is best
tess who had given ear to this thought the words were addressed to the dairyman but she was wrong
a reply in the shape of why
came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal whom she had not hitherto perceived
oh yes there's nothing like a fiddle said the dairyman
though i do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cowsat least that's my experience
once there was an old aged man over at mellstockwilliam dewy by nameone of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over therejonathan do ye mindi knowed the man by sight as well as i know my own brother in a manner of speaking
well this man was a coming home along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle one fine moonlight night and for shortness' sake he took a cut across fortyacres a field lying that way where a bull was out to grass
the bull seed william and took after him horns aground begad and though william runned his best and hadn't much drink in him considering 'twas a wedding and the folks well off he found he'd never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself
well as a last thought he pulled out his fiddle as he runned and struck up a jig turning to the bull and backing towards the corner
the bull softened down and stood still looking hard at william dewy who fiddled on and on till a sort of a smile stole over the bull's face
but no sooner did william stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of william's breeches
well william had to turn about and play on willynilly and 'twas only three o'clock in the world and 'a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours and he so leery and tired that 'a didn't know what to do
when he had scraped till about four o'clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon and he said to himself 'there's only this last tune between me and eternal welfare
heaven save me or i'm a done man'
well then he called to mind how he'd seen the cattle kneel o' christmas eves in the dead o' night
it was not christmas eve then but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull
so he broke into the 'tivity hymm just as at christmas carolsinging when lo and behold down went the bull on his bended knees in his ignorance just as if 'twere the true 'tivity night and hour
as soon as his horned friend were down william turned clinked off like a longdog and jumped safe over hedge before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him
william used to say that he'd seen a man look a fool a good many times but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon and 'twas not christmas eve

yes william dewy that was the man's name and i can tell you to a foot where's he alying in mellstock churchyard at this very momentjust between the second yewtree and the north aisle
it's a curious story it carries us back to medieval times when faith was a living thing
the remark singular for a dairyyard was murmured by the voice behind the dun cow but as nobody understood the reference no notice was taken except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply scepticism as to his tale
well 'tis quite true sir whether or no
i knowed the man well
oh yes i have no doubt of it said the person behind the dun cow
tess's attention was thus attracted to the dairyman's interlocutor of whom she could see but the merest patch owing to his burying his head so persistently in the flank of the milcher
she could not understand why he should be addressed as sir even by the dairyman himself
but no explanation was discernible he remained under the cow long enough to have milked three uttering a private ejaculation now and then as if he could not get on
take it gentle sir take it gentle said the dairyman
'tis knack not strength that does it
so i find said the other standing up at last and stretching his arms
i think i have finished her however though she made my fingers ache
tess could then see him at full length
he wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairyfarmer when milking and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard but this was all his local livery
beneath it was something educated reserved subtle sad differing
but the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before
such vicissitudes had tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the clubdance at marlottthe passing stranger who had come she knew not whence had danced with others but not with her and slightingly left her and gone on his way with his friends
the flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest recognizing her also he should by some means discover her story
but it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him
she saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful and had acquired a young man's shapely moustache and beardthe latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root
under his linen milkingpinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket cord breeches and gaiters and a starched white shirt
without the milkinggear nobody could have guessed what he was
he might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman
that he was but a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow
meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the newcomer how pretty she is
with something of real generosity and admiration though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertionwhich strictly speaking they might have done prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in tess
when the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors where mrs crick the dairyman's wifewho was too respectable to go out milking herself and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore printswas giving an eye to the leads and things
only two or three of the maids tess learnt slept in the dairyhouse besides herself most of the helpers going to their homes
she saw nothing at suppertime of the superior milker who had commented on the story and asked no questions about him the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bedchamber
it was a large room over the milkhouse some thirty feet long the sleepingcots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment
they were blooming young women and except one rather older than herself
by bedtime tess was thoroughly tired and fell asleep immediately
but one of the girls who occupied an adjoining bed was more wakeful than tess and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered
the girl's whispered words mingled with the shades and to tess's drowsy mind they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated
mr angel clarehe that is learning milking and that plays the harpnever says much to us
he is a pa'son's son and is too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls
he is the dairyman's pupillearning farming in all its branches
he has learnt sheepfarming at another place and he's now mastering dairywork
yes he is quite the gentlemanborn
his father is the reverent mr clare at emminstera good many miles from here
ohi have heard of him said her companion now awake
a very earnest clergyman is he not
yesthat he isthe earnestest man in all wessex they saythe last of the old low church sort they tell mefor all about here be what they call high
all his sons except our mr clare be made pa'sons too
tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present mr clare was not made a parson like his brethren and gradually fell asleep again the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft and the measured dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs
xviii   angel clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure but as an appreciative voice a long regard of fixed abstracted eyes and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a man's though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and then enough to do away with any inference of indecision
nevertheless something nebulous preoccupied vague in his bearing and regard marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern about his material future
yet as a lad people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he tried
he was the youngest son of his father a poor parson at the other end of the county and had arrived at talbothays dairy as a six months' pupil after going the round of some other farms his object being to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming with a view either to the colonies or the tenure of a homefarm as circumstances might decide
his entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither by himself nor by others
mr clare the elder whose first wife had died and left him a daughter married a second late in life
this lady had somewhat unexpectedly brought him three sons so that between angel the youngest and his father the vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation
of these boys the aforesaid angel the child of his old age was the only son who had not taken a university degree though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training
some two or three years before angel's appearance at the marlott dance on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home a parcel came to the vicarage from the local bookseller's directed to the reverend james clare
the vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book read a few pages whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm
why has this been sent to my house
he asked peremptorily holding up the volume
it was ordered sir
not by me or any one belonging to me i am happy to say
the shopkeeper looked into his orderbook
oh it has been misdirected sir he said
it was ordered by mr angel clare and should have been sent to him
mr clare winced as if he had been struck
he went home pale and dejected and called angel into his study
look into this book my boy he said
what do you know about it
i ordered it said angel simply
what for
to read
how can you think of reading it
how can i
whyit is a system of philosophy
there is no more moral or even religious work published
yesmoral enough i don't deny that
but religiousand for you who intend to be a minister of the gospel
since you have alluded to the matter father said the son with anxious thought upon his face i should like to say once for all that i should prefer not to take orders
i fear i could not conscientiously do so
i love the church as one loves a parent
i shall always have the warmest affection for her
there is no institution for whose history i have a deeper admiration but i cannot honestly be ordained her minister as my brothers are while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry
it had never occurred to the straightforward and simpleminded vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this
he was stultified shocked paralysed
and if angel were not going to enter the church what was the use of sending him to cambridge
the university as a step to anything but ordination seemed to this man of fixed ideas a preface without a volume
he was a man not merely religious but devout a firm believernot as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimbleriggers in the church and out of it but in the old and ardent sense of the evangelical school one who could                 indeed opine         that the eternal and divine         did eighteen centuries ago         in very truth   angel's father tried argument persuasion entreaty
no father i cannot underwrite article four leave alone the rest taking it 'in the literal and grammatical sense' as required by the declaration and therefore i can't be a parson in the present state of affairs said angel
my whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction to quote your favorite epistle to the hebrews 'the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain'
his father grieved so deeply that it made angel quite ill to see him
what is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a university education if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of god
his father repeated
why that it may be used for the honour and glory of man father
perhaps if angel had persevered he might have gone to cambridge like his brothers
but the vicar's view of that seat of learning as a steppingstone to orders alone was quite a family tradition and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust and wrong the pious heads of the household who had been and were as his father had hinted compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men
i will do without cambridge said angel at last
i feel that i have no right to go there in the circumstances
the effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing themselves
he spent years and years in desultory studies undertakings and meditations he began to evince considerable indifference to social forms and observances
the material distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised
even the good old family to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives
as a balance to these austerities when he went to live in london to see what the world was like and with a view to practising a profession or business there he was carried off his head and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself though luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience
early association with country solitudes had bred in him an unconquerable and almost unreasonable aversion to modern town life and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual one
but something had to be done he had wasted many valuable years and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a colonial farmer it occurred to angel that this might be a lead in the right direction
farming either in the colonies america or at homefarming at any rate after becoming well qualified for the business by a careful apprenticeshipthat was a vocation which would probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued even more than a competencyintellectual liberty
so we find angel clare at sixandtwenty here at talbothays as a student of kine and as there were no houses near at hand in which he could get a comfortable lodging a boarder at the dairyman's
his room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the dairyhouse
it could only be reached by a ladder from the cheeseloft and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it as his retreat
here clare had plenty of space and could often be heard by the dairyfolk pacing up and down when the household had gone to rest
a portion was divided off at one end by a curtain behind which was his bed the outer part being furnished as a homely sittingroom
at first he lived up above entirely reading a good deal and strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale saying when in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some day
but he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals downstairs in the general diningkitchen with the dairyman and his wife and the maids and men who all together formed a lively assembly for though but few milking hands slept in the house several joined the family at meals
the longer clare resided here the less objection had he to his company and the more did he like to share quarters with them in common
much to his surprise he took indeed a real delight in their companionship
the conventional farmfolk of his imagination personified in the newspaperpress by the pitiable dummy known as hodgewere obliterated after a few days' residence
at close quarters no hodge was to be seen
at first it is true when clare's intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange
sitting down as a level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding
the ideas the modes the surroundings appeared retrogressive and unmeaning
but with living on there day after day the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle
without any objective change whatever variety had taken the place of monotonousness
his host and his host's household his men and his maids as they became intimately known to clare began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process
the thought of pascal's was brought home to him a mesure qu'on a plus d'esprit on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux
les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de diffrence entre les hommes the typical and unvarying hodge ceased to exist
he had been disintegrated into a number of varied fellowcreaturesbeings of many minds beings infinite in difference some happy many serene a few depressed one here and there bright even to genius some stupid others wanton others austere some mutely miltonic some potentially cromwellianinto men who had private views of each other as he had of his friends who could applaud or condemn each other amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or vices men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the road to dusty death
unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake and for what it brought apart from its bearing on his own proposed career
considering his position he became wonderfully free from the chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline of belief in a beneficent power
for the first time of late years he could read as his musings inclined him without any eye to cramming for a profession since the few farming handbooks which he deemed it desirable to master occupied him but little time
he grew away from old associations and saw something new in life and humanity
secondarily he made close acquaintance with phenomena which he had before known but darklythe seasons in their moods morning and evening night and noon winds in their different tempers trees waters and mists shades and silences and the voices of inanimate things
the early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted and by mrs crick's orders who held that he was too genteel to mess at their table it was angel clare's custom to sit in the yawning chimneycorner during the meal his cupandsaucer and plate being placed on a hinged flap at his elbow
the light from the long wide mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook and assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so
between clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes while to the side was the milkhouse door through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows full to the brim with the morning's milk
at the further end the great churn could be seen revolving and its slipslopping heardthe moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy
for several days after tess's arrival clare sitting abstractedly reading from some book periodical or piece of music just come by post hardly noticed that she was present at table
she talked so little and the other maids talked so much that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression
one day however when he had been conning one of his musicscores and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head he lapsed into listlessness and the musicsheet rolled to the hearth
he looked at the fire of logs with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfastcooking and boiling and it seemed to jig to his inward tune also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel or crossbar plumed with soot which quivered to the same melody also at the halfempty kettle whining an accompaniment
the conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought what a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has
i suppose it is the new one
clare looked round upon her seated with the others
she was not looking towards him
indeed owing to his long silence his presence in the room was almost forgotten
i don't know about ghosts she was saying but i do know that our souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive
the dairyman turned to her with his mouth full his eyes charged with serious inquiry and his great knife and fork breakfasts were breakfasts here planted erect on the table like the beginning of a gallows
whatreally now
and is it so maidy
he said
a very easy way to feel 'em go continued tess is to lie on the grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star and by fixing your mind upon it you will soon find that you are hundreds and hundreds o' miles away from your body which you don't seem to want at all
the dairyman removed his hard gaze from tess and fixed it on his wife
now that's a rum thing christianerhey
to think o' the miles i've vamped o' starlight nights these last thirty year courting or trading or for doctor or for nurse and yet never had the least notion o' that till now or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirtcollar
the general attention being drawn to her including that of the dairyman's pupil tess flushed and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy resumed her breakfast
clare continued to observe her
she soon finished her eating and having a consciousness that clare was regarding her began to trace imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched
what a fresh and virginal daughter of nature that milkmaid is
he said to himself
and then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray
he concluded that he had beheld her before where he could not tell
a casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been and he was not greatly curious about it
but the circumstance was sufficient to lead him to select tess in preference to the other pretty milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind
xix   in general the cows were milked as they presented themselves without fancy or choice
but certain cows will show a fondness for a particular pair of hands sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite the pail of a stranger being unceremoniously kicked over
it was dairyman crick's rule to insist on breaking down these partialities and aversions by constant interchange since otherwise in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy he was placed in a difficulty
the maids' private aims however were the reverse of the dairyman's rule the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless
tess like her compeers soon discovered which of the cows had a preference for her style of manipulation and her fingers having become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years she would have been glad to meet the milchers' views in this respect
out of the whole ninetyfive there were eight in particulardumpling fancy lofty mist old pretty young pretty tidy and loudwho though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the fingers
knowing however the dairyman's wish she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they came excepting the very hard yielders which she could not yet manage
but she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter till she felt that their order could not be the result of accident
the dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of late and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes as she rested against the cow full of sly inquiry upon him
mr clare you have ranged the cows
she said blushing and in making the accusation symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper lip in spite of her so as to show the tips of her teeth the lower lip remaining severely still
well it makes no difference said he
you will always be here to milk them
do you think so
i hope i shall
but i don't know
she was angry with herself afterwards thinking that he unaware of her grave reasons for liking this seclusion might have mistaken her meaning
she had spoken so earnestly to him as if his presence were somehow a factor in her wish
her misgiving was such that at dusk when the milking was over she walked in the garden alone to continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his considerateness
it was a typical summer evening in june the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses if not five
there was no distinction between the near and the far and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon
the soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise
it was broken by the strumming of strings
tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head
dim flattened constrained by their confinement they had never appealed to her as now when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity
to speak absolutely both instrument and execution were poor but the relative is all and as she listened tess like a fascinated bird could not leave the spot
far from leaving she drew up towards the performer keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence
the outskirt of the garden in which tess found herself had been left uncultivated for some years and was now damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive smellsweeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers
she went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth gathering cuckoospittle on her skirts cracking snails that were underfoot staining her hands with thistlemilk and slugslime and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which though snowwhite on the appletree trunks made madder stains on her skin thus she drew quite near to clare still unobserved of him
tess was conscious of neither time nor space
the exaltation which she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star came now without any determination of hers she undulated upon the thin notes of the secondhand harp and their harmonies passed like breezes through her bringing tears into her eyes
the floating pollen seemed to be his notes made visible and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the garden's sensibility
though near nightfall the ranksmelling weedflowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound
the light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the western bank of cloud it was like a piece of day left behind by accident dusk having closed in elsewhere
he concluded his plaintive melody a very simple performance demanding no great skill and she waited thinking another might be begun
but tired of playing he had desultorily come round the fence and was rambling up behind her
tess her cheeks on fire moved away furtively as if hardly moving at all
angel however saw her light summer gown and he spoke his low tones reaching her though he was some distance off
what makes you draw off in that way tess
said he
are you afraid
oh no sirnot of outdoor things especially just now when the appleblooth is falling and everything is so green
but you have your indoor fearseh
wellyes sir
what of
i couldn't quite say
the milk turning sour
no
life in general
yes sir
ahso have i very often
this hobble of being alive is rather serious don't you think so
it isnow you put it that way
all the same i shouldn't have expected a young girl like you to see it so just yet
how is it you do
she maintained a hesitating silence
come tess tell me in confidence
she thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her and replied shyly  the trees have inquisitive eyes haven't theythat is seem as if they had
and the river says'why do ye trouble me with your looks'
and you seem to see numbers of tomorrows just all in a line the first of them the biggest and clearest the others getting smaller and smaller as they stand farther away but they all seem very fierce and cruel and as if they said 'i'm coming
beware of me
beware of me'

but you sir can raise up dreams with your music and drive all such horrid fancies away
he was surprised to find this young womanwho though but a milkmaid had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of her housematesshaping such sad imaginings
she was expressing in her own native phrasesassisted a little by her sixth standard trainingfeelings which might almost have been called those of the agethe ache of modernism
the perception arrested him less when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definitiona more accurate expression by words in logy and ism of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped for centuries
still it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so young more than strange it was impressive interesting pathetic
not guessing the cause there was nothing to remind him that experience is as to intensity and not as to duration
tess's passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest
tess on her part could not understand why a man of clerical family and good education and above physical want should look upon it as a mishap to be alive
for the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason
but how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the valley of humiliation have felt with the man of uzas she herself had felt two or three years agomy soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life
i loathe it i would not live alway
it was true that he was at present out of his class
but she knew that was only because like peter the great in a shipwright's yard he was studying what he wanted to know
he did not milk cows because he was obliged to milk cows but because he was learning to be a rich and prosperous dairyman landowner agriculturist and breeder of cattle
he would become an american or australian abraham commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds his spotted and his ringstraked his menservants and his maids
at times nevertheless it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish musical thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer and not a clergyman like his father and brothers
thus neither having the clue to the other's secret they were respectively puzzled at what each revealed and awaited new knowledge of each other's character and mood without attempting to pry into each other's history
every day every hour brought to him one more little stroke of her nature and to her one more of his
tess was trying to lead a repressed life but she little divined the strength of her own vitality
at first tess seemed to regard angel clare as an intelligence rather than as a man
as such she compared him with herself and at every discovery of the abundance of his illuminations of the distance between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable andean altitude of his she became quite dejected disheartened from all further effort on her own part whatever
he observed her dejection one day when he had casually mentioned something to her about pastoral life in ancient greece
she was gathering the buds called lords and ladies from the bank while he spoke
why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden
he asked
oh 'tis onlyabout my own self she said with a frail laugh of sadness fitfully beginning to peel a lady meanwhile
just a sense of what might have been with me
my life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances
when i see what you know what you have read and seen and thought i feel what a nothing i am
i'm like the poor queen of sheba who lived in the bible
there is no more spirit in me
bless my soul don't go troubling about that
why he said with some enthusiasm i should be only too glad my dear tess to help you to anything in the way of history or any line of reading you would like to take up  it is a lady again interrupted she holding out the bud she had peeled
what
i meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to peel them
never mind about the lords and ladies
would you like to take up any course of studyhistory for example
sometimes i feel i don't want to know anything more about it than i know already
why not
because what's the use of learning that i am one of a long row onlyfinding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me and to know that i shall only act her part making me sad that's all
the best is not to remember that your nature and your past doings have been just like thousands' and thousands' and that your coming life and doings 'll be like thousands's and thousands'
what really then you don't want to learn anything
i shouldn't mind learning whywhy the sun do shine on the just and the unjust alike she answered with a slight quaver in her voice
but that's what books will not tell me
tess fie for such bitterness
of course he spoke with a conventional sense of duty only for that sort of wondering had not been unknown to himself in bygone days
and as he looked at the unpracticed mouth and lips he thought that such a daughter of the soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote
she went on peeling the lords and ladies till clare regarding for a moment the wavelike curl of her lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek lingeringly went away
when he was gone she stood awhile thoughtfully peeling the last bud and then awakening from her reverie flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground in an ebullition of displeasure with herself for her niaiserie and with a quickening warmth in her heart of hearts
how stupid he must think her
in an access of hunger for his good opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to forget so unpleasant had been its issuesthe identity of her family with that of the knightly d'urbervilles
barren attribute as it was disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her perhaps mr clare as a gentleman and a student of history would respect her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and ladies if he knew that those purbeckmarble and alabaster people in kingsbere church really represented her own lineal forefathers that she was no spurious d'urberville compounded of money and ambition like those at trantridge but true d'urberville to the bone
but before venturing to make the revelation dubious tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon mr clare by asking the former if mr clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land
mr clare said the dairyman emphatically is one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowednot a bit like the rest of his family and if there's one thing that he do hate more than another 'tis the notion of what's called a' old family
he says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days and can't have anything left in 'em now
there's the billets and the drenkhards and the greys and the st quintins and the hardys and the goulds who used to own the lands for miles down this valley you could buy 'em all up now for an old song a'most
why our little retty priddle here you know is one of the paridellesthe old family that used to own lots o' the lands out by king's hintock now owned by the earl o' wessex afore even he or his was heard of
well mr clare found this out and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days
'ah'
he says to her 'you'll never make a good dairymaid
all your skill was used up ages ago in palestine and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds'
a boy came here t'other day asking for a job and said his name was matt and when we asked him his surname he said he'd never heard that 'a had any surname and when we asked why he said he supposed his folks hadn't been 'stablished long enough
'ah
you're the very boy i want'
says mr clare jumping up and shaking hands wi'en 'i've great hopes of you' and gave him halfacrown
o no
he can't stomach old families
after hearing this caricature of clare's opinion poor tess was glad that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her familyeven though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and become a new one
besides another diarygirl was as good as she it seemed in that respect
she held her tongue about the d'urberville vault and the knight of the conqueror whose name she bore
the insight afforded into clare's character suggested to her that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest in his eyes
xx   the season developed and matured
another year's instalment of flowers leaves nightingales thrushes finches and such ephemeral creatures took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles
rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and stretched them into long stalks lifted up sap in noiseless streams opened petals and sucked out scents in invisible jets and breathings
dairyman crick's household of maids and men lived on comfortably placidly even merrily
their position was perhaps the happiest of all positions in the social scale being above the line at which neediness ends and below the line at which the convenances begin to cramp natural feelings and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too little of enough
thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing aimed at out of doors
tess and clare unconsciously studied each other ever balanced on the edge of a passion yet apparently keeping out of it
all the while they were converging under an irresistible law as surely as two streams in one vale
tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now possibly never would be so happy again
she was for one thing physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings
the sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil
moreover she and clare also stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection and love where no profundities have been reached no reflections have set in awkwardly inquiring whither does this new current tend to carry me
what does it mean to my future
how does it stand towards my past
tess was the merest stray phenomenon to angel clare as yeta rosy warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of persistence in his consciousness
so he allowed his mind to be occupied with her deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a philosopher's regard of an exceedingly novel fresh and interesting specimen of womankind
they met continually they could not help it
they met daily in that strange and solemn interval the twilight of the morning in the violet or pink dawn for it was necessary to rise early so very early here
milking was done betimes and before the milking came the skimming which began at a little past three
it usually fell to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest the first being aroused by an alarmclock and as tess was the latest arrival and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep though the alarm as others did this task was thrust most frequently upon her
no sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed than she left her room and ran to the dairyman's door then up the ladder to angel's calling him in a loud whisper then woke her fellowmilkmaids
by the time that tess was dressed clare was downstairs and out in the humid air
the remaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later
the gray halftones of daybreak are not the gray halftones of the day's close though the degree of their shade may be the same
in the twilight of the morning light seems active darkness passive in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and crescent and the light which is the drowsy reverse
being so oftenpossibly not always by chancethe first two persons to get up at the dairyhouse they seemed to themselves the first persons up of all the world
in these early days of her residence here tess did not skim but went out of doors at once after rising where he was generally awaiting her
the spectral halfcompounded aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with a feeling of isolation as if they were adam and eve
at this dim inceptive stage of the day tess seemed to clare to exhibit a dignified largeness both of disposition and physique an almost regnant power possibly because he knew that at that preternatural time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon very few in all england
fair women are usually asleep at midsummer dawns
she was close at hand and the rest were nowhere
the mixed singular luminous gloom in which they walked along together to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the resurrection hour
he little thought that the magdalen might be at his side
whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his companion's face which was the focus of his eyes rising above the mist stratum seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it
she looked ghostly as if she were merely a soul at large
in reality her face without appearing to do so had caught the cold gleam of day from the northeast his own face though he did not think of it wore the same aspect to her
it was then as has been said that she impressed him most deeply
she was no longer the milkmaid but a visionary essence of womana whole sex condensed into one typical form
he called her artemis demeter and other fanciful names half teasingly which she did not like because she did not understand them
call me tess she would say askance and he did
then it would grow lighter and her features would become simply feminine they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer bliss to those of a being who craved it
at these nonhuman hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl
herons came with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of the mead or if already on the spot hardily maintained their standing in the water as the pair walked by watching them by moving their heads round in a slow horizontal passionless wheel like the turn of puppets by clockwork
they could then see the faint summer fogs in layers woolly level and apparently no thicker than counterpanes spread about the meadows in detached remnants of small extent
on the gray moisture of the grass were marks where the cows had lain through the nightdarkgreen islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses in the general sea of dew
from each island proceeded a serpentine trail by which the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up at the end of which trail they found her the snoring puff from her nostrils when she recognized them making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one
then they drove the animals back to the barton or sat down to milk them on the spot as the case might require
or perhaps the summer fog was more general and the meadows lay like a white sea out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous rocks
birds would soar through it into the upper radiance and hang on the wing sunning themselves or alight on the wet rails subdividing the mead which now shone like glass rods
minute diamonds of moisture from the mist hung too upon tess's eyelashes and drops upon her hair like seed pearls
when the day grew quite strong and commonplace these dried off her moreover tess then lost her strange and ethereal beauty her teeth lips and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she was again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only who had to hold her own against the other women of the world
about this time they would hear dairyman crick's voice lecturing the nonresident milkers for arriving late and speaking sharply to old deborah fyander for not washing her hands
for heaven's sake pop thy hands under the pump deb
upon my soul if the london folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways they'd swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a'ready and that's saying a good deal
the milking progressed till towards the end tess and clare in common with the rest could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged out from the wall in the kitchen by mrs crick this being the invariable preliminary to each meal the same horrible scrape accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared
xxi   there was a great stir in the milkhouse just after breakfast
the churn revolved as usual but the butter would not come
whenever this happened the dairy was paralyzed
squish squash echoed the milk in the great cylinder but never arose the sound they waited for
dairyman crick and his wife the milkmaids tess marian retty priddle izz huett and the married ones from the cottages also mr clare jonathan kail old deborah and the rest stood gazing hopelessly at the churn and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moonlike eyes to show his sense of the situation
even the melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round
'tis years since i went to conjuror trendle's son in egdonyears
said the dairyman bitterly
and he was nothing to what his father had been
i have said fifty times if i have said once that i don't believe in en though 'a do cast folks' waters very true
but i shall have to go to 'n if he's alive
o yes i shall have to go to 'n if this sort of thing continnys
even mr clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation
conjuror fall t'other side of casterbridge that they used to call 'wideo' was a very good man when i was a boy said jonathan kail
but he's rotten as touchwood by now
my grandfather used to go to conjuror mynterne out at owlscombe and a clever man a' were so i've heard grandf'er say continued mr crick
but there's no such genuine folk about nowadays
mrs crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand
perhaps somebody in the house is in love she said tentatively
i've heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it
why crickthat maid we had years ago do ye mind and how the butter didn't come then  ah yes yesbut that isn't the rights o't
it had nothing to do with the lovemaking
i can mind all about it'twas the damage to the churn
he turned to clare
jack dollop a 'hore'sbird of a fellow we had here as milker at one time sir courted a young woman over at mellstock and deceived her as he had deceived many afore
but he had another sort o' woman to reckon wi' this time and it was not the girl herself
one holy thursday of all days in the almanack we was here as we mid be now only there was no churning in hand when we zid the girl's mother coming up to the door wi' a great brassmounted umbrella in her hand that would ha' felled an ox and saying 'do jack dollop work herebecause i want him
i have a big bone to pick with he i can assure 'n'
and some way behind her mother walked jack's young woman crying bitterly into her handkercher
'o lard here's a time'
said jack looking out o' winder at 'em
'she'll murder me
where shall i getwhere shall i
don't tell her where i be'
and with that he scrambled into the churn through the trapdoor and shut himself inside just as the young woman's mother busted into the milkhouse
'the villainwhere is he'
says she
'i'll claw his face for'n let me only catch him'
well she hunted about everywhere ballyragging jack by side and by seam jack lying a'most stifled inside the churn and the poor maidor young woman ratherstanding at the door crying her eyes out
i shall never forget it never
'twould have melted a marble stone
but she couldn't find him nowhere at all
the dairyman paused and one or two words of comment came from the listeners
dairyman crick's stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality though old friends knew better
the narrator went on  well how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it i could never tell but she found out that he was inside that there churn
without saying a word she took hold of the winch it was turned by handpower then and round she swung him and jack began to flop about inside
'o lard
stop the churn
let me out'
says he popping out his head
'i shall be churned into a pummy'
he was a cowardly chap in his heart as such men mostly be
'not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence'
says the old woman
'stop the churn you old witch'
screams he
'you call me old witch do ye you deceiver'
says she 'when ye ought to ha' been calling me motherlaw these last five months'
and on went the churn and jack's bones rattled round again
well none of us ventured to interfere and at last 'a promised to make it right wi' her
'yesi'll be as good as my word'
he said
and so it ended that day
while the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick movement behind their backs and they looked round
tess palefaced had gone to the door
how warm 'tis today
she said almost inaudibly
it was warm and none of them connected her withdrawal with the reminiscences of the dairyman
he went forward and opened the door for her saying with tender raillery  why maidy he frequently with unconscious irony gave her this pet name the prettiest milker i've got in my dairy you mustn't get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather or we shall be finely put to for want of 'ee by dogdays shan't we mr clare
i was faintandi think i am better out o' doors she said mechanically and disappeared outside
fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment changed its squashing for a decided flickflack
'tis coming
cried mrs crick and the attention of all was called off from tess
that fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally but she remained much depressed all the afternoon
when the evening milking was done she did not care to be with the rest of them and went out of doors wandering along she knew not whither
she was wretchedo so wretchedat the perception that to her companions the dairyman's story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise none of them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it to a certainty not one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience
the evening sun was now ugly to her like a great inflamed wound in the sky
only a solitary crackedvoice reedsparrow greeted her from the bushes by the river in a sad machinemade tone resembling that of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn
in these long june days the milkmaids and indeed most of the household went to bed at sunset or sooner the morning work before milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails
tess usually accompanied her fellows upstairs
tonight however she was the first to go to their common chamber and she had dozed when the other girls came in
she saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished sun which flushed their forms with its colour she dozed again but she was reawakened by their voices and quietly turned her eyes towards them
neither of her three chambercompanions had got into bed
they were standing in a group in their nightgowns barefooted at the window the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and the walls around them
all were watching somebody in the garden with deep interest their three faces close together a jovial and round one a pale one with dark hair and a fair one whose tresses were auburn
don't push
you can see as well as i said retty the auburnhaired and youngest girl without removing her eyes from the window
'tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me retty priddle said jollyfaced marian the eldest slily
his thoughts be of other cheeks than thine
retty priddle still looked and the others looked again
there he is again
cried izz huett the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips
you needn't say anything izz answered retty
for i zid you kissing his shade
what did you see her doing
asked marian
whyhe was standing over the wheytub to let off the whey and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind close to izz who was standing there filling a vat
she put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth i zid her though he didn't
o izz huett
said marian
a rosy spot came into the middle of izz huett's cheek
well there was no harm in it she declared with attempted coolness
and if i be in love wi'en so is retty too and so be you marian come to that
marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness
i
she said
what a tale
ah there he is again
dear eyesdear facedear mr clare
thereyou've owned it
so have youso have we all said marian with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion
it is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves though we need not own it to other folks
i would just marry 'n tomorrow
so would iand more murmured izz huett
and i too whispered the more timid retty
the listener grew warm
we can't all marry him said izz
we shan't either of us which is worse still said the eldest
there he is again
they all three blew him a silent kiss
why
asked retty quickly
because he likes tess durbeyfield best said marian lowering her voice
i have watched him every day and have found it out
there was a reflective silence
but she don't care anything for 'n
at length breathed retty
welli sometimes think that too
but how silly all this is
said izz huett impatiently
of course he won't marry any one of us or tess eithera gentleman's son who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad
more likely to ask us to come wi'en as farmhands at so much a year
one sighed and another sighed and marian's plump figure sighed biggest of all
somebody in bed hard by sighed too
tears came into the eyes of retty priddle the pretty redhaired youngestthe last bud of the paridelles so important in the county annals
they watched silently a little longer their three faces still close together as before and the triple hues of their hair mingling
but the unconscious mr clare had gone indoors and they saw him no more and the shades beginning to deepen they crept into their beds
in a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room
marian was soon snoring but izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time
retty priddle cried herself to sleep
the deeperpassioned tess was very far from sleeping even then
this conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day
scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her breast
for that matter she knew herself to have the preference
being more finely formed better educated and though the youngest except retty more woman than either she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in angel clare's heart against these her candid friends
but the grave question was ought she to do this
there was to be sure hardly a ghost of a chance for either of them in a serious sense but there was or had been a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here
such unequal attachments had led to marriage and she had heard from mrs crick that mr clare had one day asked in a laughing way what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady and all the while ten thousand acres of colonial pasture to feed and cattle to rear and corn to reap
a farmwoman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him
but whether mr clare had spoken seriously or not why should she who could never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now and who had religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so draw off mr clare's attention from other women for the brief happiness of sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at talbothays
xxii   they came downstairs yawning next morning but skimming and milking were proceeded with as usual and they went indoors to breakfast
dairyman crick was discovered stamping about the house
he had received a letter in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang
and begad so 't have
said the dairyman who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck
yestaste for yourself
several of them gathered round him and mr clare tasted tess tasted also the other indoor milkmaids one or two of the milkingmen and last of all mrs crick who came out from the waiting breakfasttable
there certainly was a twang
the dairyman who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained suddenly exclaimed  'tis garlic
and i thought there wasn't a blade left in that mead
then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late had in years gone by spoilt the butter in the same way
the dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time and thought the butter bewitched
we must overhaul that mead he resumed this mustn't continny
all having armed themselves with old pointed knives they went out together
as the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them
however they formed themselves into line all assisting owing to the importance of the search the dairyman at the upper end with mr clare who had volunteered to help then tess marian izz huett and retty then bill lewell jonathan and the married dairywomenbeck knibbs with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes and flaxen frances consumptive from the winter damps of the watermeadswho lived in their respective cottages
with eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the field returning a little further down in such a manner that when they should have finished not a single inch of the pasture but would have fallen under the eye of some one of them
it was a most tedious business not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being discoverable in the whole field yet such was the herb's pungency that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the whole dairy's produce for the day
differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did they yet formed bending a curiously uniform rowautomatic noiseless and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well have been excused for massing them as hodge
as they crept along stooping low to discern the plant a soft yellow gleam was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces giving them an elfish moonlit aspect though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the strength of noon
angel clare who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with the rest in everything glanced up now and then
it was not of course by accident that he walked next to tess
well how are you
he murmured
very well thank you sir she replied demurely
as they had been discussing a score of personal matters only halfanhour before the introductory style seemed a little superfluous
but they got no further in speech just then
they crept and crept the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter and his elbow sometimes brushing hers
at last the dairyman who came next could stand it no longer
upon my soul and body this here stooping do fairly make my back open and shut
he exclaimed straightening himself slowly with an excruciated look till quite upright
and you maidy tess you wasn't well a day or two agothis will make your head ache finely
don't do any more if you feel fainty leave the rest to finish it
dairyman crick withdrew and tess dropped behind
mr clare also stepped out of line and began privateering about for the weed
when she found him near her her very tension at what she had heard the night before made her the first to speak
don't they look pretty
she said
who
izzy huett and retty
tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good farmer's wife and that she ought to recommend them and obscure her own wretched charms
pretty
well yesthey are pretty girlsfresh looking
i have often thought so
though poor dears prettiness won't last long
o no unfortunately
they are excellent dairywomen
yes though not better than you
they skim better than i
do they
clare remained observing themnot without their observing him
she is colouring up continued tess heroically
who
retty priddle
oh
why it that
because you are looking at her
selfsacrificing as her mood might be tess could not well go further and cry marry one of them if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady and don't think of marrying me
she followed dairyman crick and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that clare remained behind
from this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid himnever allowing herself as formerly to remain long in his company even if their juxtaposition were purely accidental
she gave the other three every chance
tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that angel clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping and her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of either in the least degree bred a tender respect in tess for what she deemed rightly or wrongly the selfcontrolling sense of duty shown by him a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the opposite sex and in the absence of which more than one of the simple hearts who were his housemates might have gone weeping on her pilgrimage
xxiii   the hot weather of july had crept upon them unawares and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the dairyfolk the cows and the trees
hot steaming rains fell frequently making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank and hindering the late haymaking in the other meads
it was sunday morning the milking was done the outdoor milkers had gone home
tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly the whole bevy having agreed to go together to mellstock church which lay some three or four miles distant from the dairyhouse
she had now been two months at talbothays and this was her first excursion
all the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed down upon the meads and washed some of the hay into the river but this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge and the air was balmy and clear
the crooked lane leading from their own parish to mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain had been to flood the lane overshoe to a distance of some fifty yards
this would have been no serious hindrance on a weekday they would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite unconcerned but on this day of vanity this sun'sday when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes and their pink white and lilac gowns on which every mud spot would be visible the pool was an awkward impediment
they could hear the churchbell callingas yet nearly a mile off
who would have expected such a rise in the river in summertime
said marian from the top of the roadside bank on which they had climbed and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along its slope till they were past the pool
we can't get there anyhow without walking right through it or else going round the turnpike way and that would make us so very late
said retty pausing hopelessly
and i do colour up so hot walking into church late and all the people staring round said marian that i hardly cool down again till we get into the thatitmaypleasethees
while they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the bend of the road and presently appeared angel clare advancing along the lane towards them through the water
four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously
his aspect was probably as unsabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parson's son often presented his attire being his dairy clothes long wading boots a cabbageleaf inside his hat to keep his head cool with a thistlespud to finish him off
he's not going to church said marian
noi wish he was
murmured tess
angel in fact rightly or wrongly to adopt the safe phrase of evasive controversialists preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer days
this morning moreover he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or not
on his walk he observed the girls from a long distance though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to notice him
he knew that the water had risen at that spot and that it would quite check their progress
so he had hastened on with a dim idea of how he could help themone of them in particular
the rosycheeked brighteyed quartet looked so charming in their light summer attire clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a roofslope that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming close
their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable flies and butterflies which unable to escape remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary
angel's eye at last fell upon tess the hindmost of the four she being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma could not help meeting his glance radiantly
he came beneath them in the water which did not rise over his long boots and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies
are you trying to get to church
he said to marian who was in front including the next two in his remark but avoiding tess
yes sir and 'tis getting late and my colour do come up so  i'll carry you through the poolevery jill of you
the whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them
i think you can't sir said marian
it is the only way for you to get past
stand still
nonsenseyou are not too heavy
i'd carry you all four together
now marian attend he continued and put your arms round my shoulders so
now
hold on
that's well done
marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed and angel strode off with her his slim figure as viewed from behind looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers
they disappeared round the curve of the road and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of marian's bonnet told where they were
in a few minutes he reappeared
izz huett was the next in order upon the bank
here he comes she murmured and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion
and i have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as marian did
there's nothing in that said tess quickly
there's a time for everything continued izz unheeding
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing the first is now going to be mine
fieit is scripture izz
yes said izz i've always a' ear at church for pretty verses
angel clare to whom threequarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness now approached izz
she quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms and angel methodically marched off with her
when he was heard returning for the third time retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her
he went up to the redhaired girl and while he was seizing her he glanced at tess
his lips could not have pronounced more plainly it will soon be you and i
her comprehension appeared in her face she could not help it
there was an understanding between them
poor little retty though by far the lightest weight was the most troublesome of clare's burdens
marian had been like a sack of meal a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered
izz had ridden sensibly and calmly
retty was a bunch of hysterics
however he got through with the disquieted creature deposited her and returned
tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground
it was now her turn
she was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of mr clare's breath and eyes which she had contemned in her companions was intensified in herself and as if fearful of betraying her secret she paltered with him at the last moment
i may be able to clim' along the bank perhapsi can clim' better than they
you must be so tired mr clare
no no tess said he quickly
and almost before she was aware she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder
three leahs to get one rachel he whispered
they are better women than i she replied magnanimously sticking to her resolve
not to me said angel
he saw her grow warm at this and they went some steps in silence
i hope i am not too heavy
she said timidly
o no
you should lift marian
such a lump
you are like an undulating billow warmed by the sun
and all this fluff of muslin about you is the froth
it is very prettyif i seem like that to you
do you know that i have undergone threequarters of this labour entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter
no
i did not expect such an event today
nor i
the water came up so sudden
that the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to the state of breathing belied
clare stood still and inclinced his face towards hers
o tessy
he exclaimed
the girl's cheeks burned to the breeze and she could not look into his eyes for her emotion
it reminded angel that he was somewhat unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position and he went no further with it
no definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet and suspension at this point was desirable now
however he walked slowly to make the remainder of the distance as long as possible but at last they came to the bend and the rest of their progress was in full view of the other three
the dry land was reached and he set her down
her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him and she could see that they had been talking of her
he hastily bade them farewell and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road
the four moved on together as before till marian broke the silence by saying  noin all truth we have no chance against her
she looked joylessly at tess
what do you mean
asked the latter
he likes 'ee bestthe very best
we could see it as he brought 'ee
he would have kissed 'ee if you had encouraged him to do it ever so little
no no said she
the gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished and yet there was no enmity or malice between them
they were generous young souls they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism is a strong sentiment and they did not blame her
such supplanting was to be
tess's heart ached
there was no concealing from herself the fact that she loved angel clare perhaps all the more passionately from knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him
there is contagion in this sentiment especially among women
and yet that same hungry nature had fought against this but too feebly and the natural result had followed
i will never stand in your way nor in the way of either of you
she declared to retty that night in the bedroom her tears running down
i can't help this my dear
i don't think marrying is in his mind at all but if he were ever to ask me i should refuse him as i should refuse any man
oh
would you
why
said wondering retty
it cannot be
but i will be plain
putting myself quite on one side i don't think he will choose either of you
i have never expected itthought of it
moaned retty
but o
i wish i was dead
the poor child torn by a feeling which she hardly understood turned to the other two girls who came upstairs just then
we be friends with her again she said to them
she thinks no more of his choosing her than we do
so the reserve went off and they were confiding and warm
i don't seem to care what i do now said marian whose mood was turned to its lowest bass
i was going to marry a dairyman at stickleford who's asked me twice butmy souli would put an end to myself rather'n be his wife now
why don't ye speak izz
to confess then murmured izz i made sure today that he was going to kiss me as he held me and i lay still against his breast hoping and hoping and never moved at all
but he did not
i don't like biding here at talbothays any longer
i shall go hwome
the air of the sleepingchamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless passion of the girls
they writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel nature's lawan emotion which they had neither expected nor desired
the incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out and the torture was almost more than they could endure
the differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this passion and each was but portion of one organism called sex
there was so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope
each one was a girl of fair common sense and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits or deny her love or give herself airs in the idea of outshining the others
the full recognition of the futility of their infatuation from a social point of view its purposeless beginning its selfbounded outlook its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye of civilization while lacking nothing in the eye of nature the one fact that it did exist ecstasizing them to a killing joyall this imparted to them a resignation a dignity which a practical and sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed
they tossed and turned on their little beds and the cheesewring dripped monotonously downstairs
b' you awake tess
whispered one halfanhour later
it was izz huett's voice
tess replied in the affirmative whereupon also retty and marian suddenly flung the bedclothes off them and sighed  so be we
i wonder what she is likethe lady they say his family have looked out for him
i wonder said izz
some lady looked out for him
gasped tess starting
i have never heard o' that
o yes'tis whispered a young lady of his own rank chosen by his family a doctor of divinity's daughter near his father's parish of emminster he don't much care for her they say
but he is sure to marry her
they had heard so very little of this yet it was enough to build up wretched dolorous dreams upon there in the shade of the night
they pictured all the details of his being won round to consent of the wedding preparations of the bride's happiness of her dress and veil of her blissful home with him when oblivion would have fallen upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned
thus they talked and ached and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away
after this disclosure tess nourished no further foolish thought that there lurked any grave and deliberate import in clare's attentions to her
it was a passing summer love of her face for love's own temporary sakenothing more
and the thorny crown of this sad conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature cleverer more beautiful than they was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored
xxiv   amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the froom vale at a season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of fertilization it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate
the ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings
july passed over their heads and the thermidorean weather which came in its wake seemed an effort on the part of nature to match the state of hearts at talbothays dairy
the air of the place so fresh in the spring and early summer was stagnant and enervating now
its heavy scents weighed upon them and at midday the landscape seemed lying in a swoon
ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the pastures but there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses purled
and as clare was oppressed by the outward heats so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent tess
the rains having passed the uplands were dry
the wheels of the dairyman's springcart as he sped home from market licked up the pulverized surface of the highway and were followed by white ribands of dust as if they had set a thin powdertrain on fire
the cows jumped wildly over the fivebarred bartongate maddened by the gadfly dairyman crick kept his shirtsleeves permanently rolled up from monday to saturday open windows had no effect in ventilation without open doors and in the dairygarden the blackbirds and thrushes crept about under the currantbushes rather in the manner of quadrupeds than of winged creatures
the flies in the kitchen were lazy teasing and familiar crawling about in the unwonted places on the floors into drawers and over the backs of the milkmaids' hands
conversations were concerning sunstroke while buttermaking and still more butterkeeping was a despair
they milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience without driving in the cows
during the day the animals obsequiously followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem with the diurnal roll and when the milkers came they could hardly stand still for the flies
on one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to stand apart from the general herd behind the corner of a hedge among them being dumpling and old pretty who loved tess's hands above those of any other maid
when she rose from her stool under a finished cow angel clare who had been observing her for some time asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next
she silently assented and with her stool at arm's length and the pail against her knee went round to where they stood
soon the sound of old pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge and then angel felt inclined to go round the corner also to finish off a hardyielding milcher who had strayed there he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself
all the men and some of the women when milking dug their foreheads into the cows and gazed into the pail
but a fewmainly the younger onesrested their heads sideways
this was tess durbeyfield's habit her temple pressing the milcher's flank her eyes fixed on the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation
she was milking old pretty thus and the sun chancing to be on the milkingside it shone flat upon her pinkgowned form and her white curtainbonnet and upon her profile rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun background of the cow
she did not know that clare had followed her round and that he sat under his cow watching her
the stillness of her head and features was remarkable she might have been in a trance her eyes open yet unseeing
nothing in the picture moved but old pretty's tail and tess's pink hands the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus like a beating heart
how very lovable her face was to him
yet there was nothing ethereal about it all was real vitality real warmth real incarnation
and it was in her mouth that this culminated
eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before and cheeks perhaps as fair brows as arched a chin and throat almost as shapely her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on the face of the earth
to a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting infatuating maddening
he had never before seen a woman's lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow
perfect he as a lover might have called them offhand
but nothey were not perfect
and it was the touch of the imperfect upon the wouldbe perfect that gave the sweetness because it was that which gave the humanity
clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease and now as they again confronted him clothed with colour and life they sent an aura over his flesh a breeze through his nerves which well nigh produced a qualm and actually produced by some mysterious physiological process a prosaic sneeze
she then became conscious that he was observing her but she would not show it by any change of position though the curious dreamlike fixity disappeared and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened and then faded till only a tinge of it was left
the influence that had passed into clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down
resolutions reticences prudences fears fell back like a defeated battalion
he jumped up from his seat and leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind went quickly towards the desire of his eyes and kneeling down beside her clasped her in his arms
tess was taken completely by surprise and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness
having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced and no one else her lips parted and she sank upon him in her momentary joy with something very like an ecstatic cry
he had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth but he checked himself for tender conscience' sake
forgive me tess dear
he whispered
i ought to have asked
idid not know what i was doing
i do not mean it as a liberty
i am devoted to you tessy dearest in all sincerity
old pretty by this time had looked round puzzled and seeing two people crouching under her where by immemorial custom there should have been only one lifted her hind leg crossly
she is angryshe doesn't know what we meanshe'll kick over the milk
exclaimed tess gently striving to free herself her eyes concerned with the quadruped's actions her heart more deeply concerned with herself and clare
she slipped up from her seat and they stood together his arm still encircling her
tess's eyes fixed on distance began to fill
why do you cry my darling
he said
oi don't know
she murmured
as she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw
well i have betrayed my feeling tess at last said he with a curious sigh of desperation signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgement
that ilove you dearly and truly i need not say
but iit shall go no further nowit distresses youi am as surprised as you are
you will not think i have presumed upon your defencelessnessbeen too quick and unreflecting will you
n'i can't tell
he had allowed her to free herself and in a minute or two the milking of each was resumed
nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into one and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few minutes later there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance
yet in the interval since crick's last view of them something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures something which had he known its quality the dairyman would have despised as a practical man yet which was based upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of socalled practicalities
a veil had been whisked aside the tract of each one's outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforwardfor a short time or for a long
end of phase the third      phase the fourth the consequence    xxv   clare restless went out into the dusk when evening drew on she who had won him having retired to her chamber
the night was as sultry as the day
there was no coolness after dark unless on the grass
roads gardenpaths the housefronts the bartonwalls were warm as hearths and reflected the noontime temperature into the noctambulist's face
he sat on the east gate of the dairyyard and knew not what to think of himself
feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day
since the sudden embrace three hours before the twain had kept apart
she seemed stilled almost alarmed at what had occurred while the novelty unpremeditation mastery of circumstance disquieted himpalpitating contemplative being that he was
he could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward
angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life soon passed through and early forgotten he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without and apostrophizing it with walt whitman     crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes   how curious you are to me   resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew
but behold the absorbing scene had been imported hither
what had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumbshow while here in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place novelty had volcanically started up as it had never for him started up elsewhere
every window of the house being open clare could hear across the yard each trivial sound of the retiring household
the dairyhouse so humble so insignificant so purely to him a place of constrained sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the landscape what was it now
the aged and lichened brick gables breathed forth stay
the windows smiled the door coaxed and beckoned the creeper blushed confederacy
a personality within it was so farreaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks mortar and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility
whose was this mighty personality
a milkmaid's
it was amazing indeed to find how great a matter the life of the obscure dairy had become to him
and though new love was to be held partly responsible for this it was not solely so
many besides angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements but as to their subjective experiences
the impressionable peasant leads a larger fuller more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king
looking at it thus he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere
despite his heterodoxy faults and weaknesses clare was a man with a conscience
tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss but a woman living her precious lifea life which to herself who endured or enjoyed it possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself
upon her sensations the whole world depended to tess through her existence all her fellowcreatures existed to her
the universe itself only came into being for tess on the particular day in the particular year in which she was born
this consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to tess by an unsympathetic first causeher all her every and only chance
how then should he look upon her as of less consequence than himself as a pretty trifle to caress and grow weary of and not deal in the greatest seriousness with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in herso fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reservein order that it might not agonize and wreck her
to encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun
living in such close relations to meet meant to fall into endearment flesh and blood could not resist it and having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged
as yet the harm done was small
but it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her
he was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse
he thought he would go and see his friends
it might be possible to sound them upon this
in less than five months his term here would have ended and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to start on his own account
would not a farmer want a wife and should a farmer's wife be a drawingroom waxfigure or a woman who understood farming
notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey
one morning when they sat down to breakfast at talbothays dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of mr clare that day
o no said dairyman crick
mr clare has gone hwome to emminster to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk
for four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke and the birds muffled their song
but neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness
he's getting on towards the end of his time wi' me added the dairyman with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal and so i suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere
how much longer is he to bide here
asked izz huett the only one of the gloomstricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question
the others waited for the dairyman's answer as if their lives hung upon it retty with parted lips gazing on the tablecloth marian with heat added to her redness tess throbbing and looking out at the meads
well i can't mind the exact day without looking at my memorandumbook replied crick with the same intolerable unconcern
and even that may be altered a bit
he'll bide to get a little practice in the calving out at the strawyard for certain
he'll hang on till the end of the year i should say
four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his societyof pleasure girdled about with pain
after that the blackness of unutterable night
at this moment of the morning angel clare was riding along a narrow lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters in the direction of his father's vicarage at emminster carrying as well as he could a little basket which contained some blackpuddings and a bottle of mead sent by mrs crick with her kind respects to his parents
the white lane stretched before him and his eyes were upon it but they were staring into next year and not at the lane
he loved her ought he to marry her
dared he to marry her
what would his mother and his brothers say
what would he himself say a couple of years after the event
that would depend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the temporary emotion or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only with no substratum of everlastingness
his father's hillsurrounded little town the tudor churchtower of red stone the clump of trees near the vicarage came at last into view beneath him and he rode down towards the wellknown gate
casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his home he beheld standing by the vestrydoor a group of girls of ages between twelve and sixteen apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one who in a moment became visible a figure somewhat older than the schoolgirls wearing a broadbrimmed hat and highlystarched cambric morninggown with a couple of books in her hand
clare knew her well
he could not be sure that she observed him he hoped she did not so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and speak to her blameless creature that she was
an overpowering reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him
the young lady was miss mercy chant the only daughter of his father's neighbour and friend whom it was his parents' quiet hope that he might wed some day
she was great at antinomianism and bibleclasses and was plainly going to hold a class now
clare's mind flew to the impassioned summersteeped heathens in the var vale their rosy faces courtpatched with cowdroppings and to one the most impassioned of them all
it was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over to emminster and hence had not written to apprise his mother and father aiming however to arrive about the breakfast hour before they should have gone out to their parish duties
he was a little late and they had already sat down to the morning meal
the group at the table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered
they were his father and mother his brother the reverend felixcurate at a town in the adjoining county home for the inside of a fortnightand his other brother the reverend cuthbert the classical scholar and fellow and dean of his college down from cambridge for the long vacation
his mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles and his father looked what in fact he wasan earnest godfearing man somewhat gaunt in years about sixtyfive his pale face lined with thought and purpose
over their heads hung the picture of angel's sister the eldest of the family sixteen years his senior who had married a missionary and gone out to africa
old mr clare was a clergyman of a type which within the last twenty years has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life
a spiritual descendant in the direct line from wycliff huss luther calvin an evangelical of the evangelicals a conversionist a man of apostolic simplicity in life and thought he had in his raw youth made up his mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence and admitted no further reasoning on them thenceforward
he was regarded even by those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme while on the other hand those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration for his thoroughness and for the remarkable power he showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying them
he loved paul of tarsus liked st john hated st james as much as he dared and regarded with mixed feelings timothy titus and philemon
the new testament was less a christiad then a pauliad to his intelligenceless an argument than an intoxication
his creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice and quite amounted on its negative side to a renunciative philosophy which had cousinship with that of schopenhauer and leopardi
he despised the canons and rubric swore by the articles and deemed himself consistent through the whole categorywhich in a way he might have been
one thing he certainly wassincere
to the aesthetic sensuous pagan pleasure in natural life and lush womanhood which his son angel had lately been experiencing in var vale his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree had he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it
once upon a time angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father in a moment of irritation that it might have resulted far better for mankind if greece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization and not palestine and his father's grief was of that blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a truth much less a half truth or a whole truth in such a proposition
he had simply preached austerely at angel for some time after
but the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long and welcomed his son today with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a child's
angel sat down and the place felt like home yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there
every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence and since he had last shared in the vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual
its transcendental aspirationsstill unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things a zenithal paradise a nadiral hellwere as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet
latterly he had seen only life felt only the great passionate pulse of existence unwarped uncontorted untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate
on their part they saw a great difference in him a growing divergence from the angel clare of former times
it was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now particularly his brothers
he was getting to behave like a farmer he flung his legs about the muscles of his face had grown more expressive his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke and more
the manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared still more the manner of the drawingroom young man
a prig would have said that he had lost culture and a prude that he had become coarse
such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the talbothays nymphs and swains
after breakfast he walked with his two brothers nonevangelical welleducated hallmarked young men correct to their remotest fibre such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition
they were both somewhat shortsighted and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision
when wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies and when shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves
when correggio's holy families were admired they admired correggio's holy families when he was decried in favour of velasquez they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection
if these two noticed angel's growing social ineptness he noticed their growing mental limitations
felix seemed to him all church cuthbert all college
his diocesan synod and visitations were the mainsprings of the world to the one cambridge to the other
each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of outsiders in civilized society persons who were neither university men nor churchmen but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected
they were both dutiful and attentive sons and were regular in their visits to their parents
felix though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father was less selfsacrificing and disinterested
more tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion in its aspect as a danger to its holder he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching
cuthbert was upon the whole the more liberalminded though with greater subtlety he had not so much heart
as they walked along the hillside angel's former feeling revived in himthat whatever their advantages by comparison with himself neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived
perhaps as with many men their opportunities of observation were not so good as their opportunities of expression
neither had an adequate conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle current in which they and their associates floated
neither saw the difference between local truth and universal truth that what the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from what the outer world was thinking
i suppose it is farming or nothing for you now my dear fellow felix was saying among other things to his youngest brother as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity
and therefore we must make the best of it
but i do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals
farming of course means roughing it externally but high thinking may go with plain living nevertheless
of course it may said angel
was it not proved nineteen hundred years agoif i may trespass upon your domain a little
why should you think felix that i am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals
well i fancied from the tone of your letters and our conversationit may be fancy onlythat you were somehow losing intellectual grasp
hasn't it struck you cuthbert
now felix said angel drily we are very good friends you know each of us treading our allotted circles but if it comes to intellectual grasp i think you as a contented dogmatist had better leave mine alone and inquire what has become of yours
they returned down the hill to dinner which was fixed at any time at which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually concluded
convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish mr and mrs clare though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions
the walk had made them hungry angel in particular who was now an outdoor man accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairyman's somewhat coarselyladen table
but neither of the old people had arrived and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered
the selfdenying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners whom they somewhat inconsistently tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh their own appetites being quite forgotten
the family sat down to table and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them
angel looked round for mrs crick's blackpuddings which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they did them at the dairy and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself
ah
you are looking for the blackpuddings my dear boy observed clare's mother
but i am sure you will not mind doing without them as i am sure your father and i shall not when you know the reason
i suggested to him that we should take mrs crick's kind present to the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his attacks of delirium tremens and he agreed that it would be a great pleasure to them so we did
of course said angel cheerfully looking round for the mead
i found the mead so extremely alcoholic continued his mother that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency so i have put it in my medicinecloset
we never drink spirits at this table on principle added his father
but what shall i tell the dairyman's wife
said angel
the truth of course said his father
i rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much
she is a kind jolly sort of body and is sure to ask me directly i return
you cannot if we did not mr clare answered lucidly
ahno though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple
a what
said cuthbert and felix both
oh'tis an expression they use down at talbothays replied angel blushing
he felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment and said no more
xxvi   it was not till the evening after family prayers that angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart
he had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots
when the service was over they went out of the room with their mother and mr clare and himself were left alone
the young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scaleeither in england or in the colonies
his father then told him that as he had not been put to the expense of sending angel up to cambridge he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day that he might not feel himself unduly slighted
as far as worldly wealth goes continued his father you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years
this considerateness on old mr clare's part led angel onward to the other and dearer subject
he observed to his father that he was then sixandtwenty and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matterssome one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield
would it not be well therefore for him to marry
his father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable and then angel put the question  what kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hardworking farmer
a truly christian woman who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goingsout and your comingsin
beyond that it really matters little
such an one can be found indeed my earnestminded friend and neighbour dr chant  but ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows churn good butter make immense cheeses know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear chickens to direct a field of labourers in an emergency and estimate the value of sheep and calves
yes a farmer's wife yes certainly
it would be desirable
mr clare the elder had plainly never thought of these points before
i was going to add he said that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find one more to your true advantage and certainly not more to your mother's mind and my own than your friend mercy whom you used to show a certain interest in
it is true that my neighbour chant's daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the communiontablealtar as i was shocked to hear her call it one daywith flowers and other stuff on festival occasions
but her father who is quite as opposed to such flummery as i says that can be cured
it is a mere girlish outbreak which i am sure will not be permanent
yes yes mercy is good and devout i know
but father don't you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as miss chant but one who in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself would suit me infinitely better
his father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's wife's duties came second to a pauline view of humanity and the impulsive angel wishing to honour his father's feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time grew specious
he said that fate or providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind
he would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound low church school of his father but she would probably be open to conviction on that point she was a regular churchgoer of simple faith honesthearted receptive intelligent graceful to a degree chaste as a vestal and in personal appearance exceptionally beautiful
is she of a family such as you would care to marry intoa lady in short
asked his startled mother who had come softly into the study during the conversation
she is not what in common parlance is called a lady said angel unflinchingly for she is a cottager's daughter as i am proud to say
but she is a lady neverthelessin feeling and nature
mercy chant is of a very good family
poohwhat's the advantage of that mother
said angel quickly
how is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as i have and shall have to do
mercy is accomplished
and accomplishments have their charm returned his mother looking at him through her silver spectacles
as to external accomplishments what will be the use of them in the life i am going to leadwhile as to her reading i can take that in hand
she'll be apt pupil enough as you would say if you knew her
she's brim full of poetryactualized poetry if i may use the expression
she lives what paperpoets only write  and she is an unimpeachable christian i am sure perhaps of the very tribe genus and species you desire to propagate
o angel you are mocking
mother i beg pardon
but as she really does attend church almost every sunday morning and is a good christian girl i am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality and feel that i may do worse than choose her
angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved tess which never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic
in their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman mr and mrs clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of providence for angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice
they said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry but that they would not object to see her
angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now
he felt that singleminded and selfsacrificing as his parents were there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs as middleclass people which it would require some tact to overcome
for though legally at liberty to do as he chose and though their daughterinlaw's qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives in the probability of her living far away from them he wished for affection's sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life
he observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in tess's life as if they were vital features
it was for herself that he loved tess her soul her heart her substancenot for her skill in the dairy her aptness as his scholar and certainly not for her simple formal faithprofessions
her unsophisticated openair existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him
he held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends
it was probable that in the lapse of ages improved systems of moral and intellectual training would appreciably perhaps considerably elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature but up to the present day culture as far as he could see might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought under its influence
this belief was confirmed by his experience of women which having latterly been extended from the cultivated middleclass into the rural community had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum than between the good and bad the wise and the foolish of the same stratum or class
it was the morning of his departure
his brothers had already left the vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north whence one was to return to his college and the other to his curacy
angel might have accompanied them but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at talbothays
he would have been an awkward member of the party for though the most appreciative humanist the most ideal religionist even the bestversed christologist of the three there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him
to neither felix nor cuthbert had he ventured to mention tess
his mother made him sandwiches and his father accompanied him on his own mare a little way along the road
having fairly well advanced his own affairs angel listened in a willing silence as they jogged on together through the shady lanes to his father's account of his parish difficulties and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved because of his strict interpretations of the new testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious calvinistic doctrine
pernicious
said mr clare with genial scorn and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea
he told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument not only amongst the poor but amongst the rich and welltodo and he also candidly admitted many failures
as an instance of the latter he mentioned the case of a young upstart squire named d'urberville living some forty miles off in the neighbourhood of trantridge
not one of the ancient d'urbervilles of kingsbere and other places
asked his son
that curiously historic wornout family with its ghostly legend of the coachandfour
o no
the original d'urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty years agoat least i believe so
this seems to be a new family which had taken the name for the credit of the former knightly line i hope they are spurious i'm sure
but it is odd to hear you express interest in old families
i thought you set less store by them even than i
you misapprehend me father you often do said angel with a little impatience
politically i am sceptical as to the virtue of their being old
some of the wise even among themselves 'exclaim against their own succession' as hamlet puts it but lyrically dramatically and even historically i am tenderly attached to them
this distinction though by no means a subtle one was yet too subtle for mr clare the elder and he went on with the story he had been about to relate which was that after the death of the senior socalled d'urberville the young man developed the most culpable passions though he had a blind mother whose condition should have made him know better
a knowledge of his career having come to the ears of mr clare when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state
though he was a stranger occupying another's pulpit he had felt this to be his duty and took for his text the words from st luke thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee
the young man much resented this directness of attack and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult mr clare without respect for his gray hairs
angel flushed with distress
dear father he said sadly i wish you would not expose yourself to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels
pain
said his father his rugged face shining in the ardour of selfabnegation
the only pain to me was pain on his account poor foolish young man
do you suppose his incensed words could give me any pain or even his blows
'being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and as the offscouring of all things unto this day'
those ancient and noble words to the corinthians are strictly true at this present hour
not blows father
he did not proceed to blows
no he did not
though i have borne blows from men in a mad state of intoxication
no
a dozen times my boy
what then
i have saved them from the guilt of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby and they have lived to thank me and praise god
may this young man do the same
said angel fervently
but i fear otherwise from what you say
we'll hope nevertheless said mr clare
and i continue to pray for him though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again
but after all one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day
now as always clare's father was sanguine as a child and though the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma he revered his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist
perhaps he revered his father's practice even more now than ever seeing that in the question of making tessy his wife his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless
the same unworldliness was what had necessitated angel's getting a living as a farmer and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities yet angel admired it none the less
indeed despite his own heterodoxy angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren
xxvii   an uphill and downhill ride of twentyodd miles through a garish midday atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of talbothays whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity the valley of the var or froom
immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below the atmosphere grew heavier the languid perfume of the summer fruits the mists the hay the flowers formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals the very bees and butterflies drowsy
clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when a long distance off he saw them dotted about the meads
it was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his studentdays and much as he loved his parents he could not help being aware that to come here as now after an experience of homelife affected him like throwing off splints and bandages even the one customary curb on the humours of english rural societies being absent in this place talbothays having no resident landlord
not a human being was out of doors at the dairy
the denizens were all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly early hours kept in summertime rendered a necessity
at the door the woodhooped pails sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed there for that purpose all of them ready and dry for the evening milking
angel entered and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters where he listened for a moment
sustained snores came from the carthouse where some of the men were lying down the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further distance
the largeleaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too their broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like halfclosed umbrellas
he unbridled and fed his horse and as he reentered the house the clock struck three
three was the afternoon skimminghour and with the stroke clare heard the creaking of the floorboards above and then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs
it was tess's who in another moment came down before his eyes
she had not heard him enter and hardly realized his presence there
she was yawning and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had been a snake's
she had stretched one arm so high above her coiledup cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn her face was flushed with sleep and her eyelids hung heavy over their pupils
the brimfulness of her nature breathed from her
it was a moment when a woman's soul is more incarnate than at any other time when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh and sex takes the outside place in the presentation
then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness before the remainder of her face was well awake
with an oddly compounded look of gladness shyness and surprise she exclaimedo mr clare
how you frightened mei  there had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered clare's tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair
dear darling tessy
he whispered putting his arm round her and his face to her flushed cheek
don't for heaven's sake mister me any more
i have hastened back so soon because of you
tess's excitable heart beat against his by way of reply and there they stood upon the redbrick floor of the entry the sun slanting in by the window upon his back as he held her tightly to his breast upon her inclining face upon the blue veins of her temple upon her naked arm and her neck and into the depths of her hair
having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat
at first she would not look straight up at him but her eyes soon lifted and his plumbed the deepness of the evervarying pupils with their radiating fibrils of blue and black and gray and violet while she regarded him as eve at her second waking might have regarded adam
i've got to go askimming she pleaded and i have on'y old deb to help me today
mrs crick is gone to market with mr crick and retty is not well and the others are gone out somewhere and won't be home till milking
as they retreated to the milkhouse deborah fyander appeared on the stairs
i have come back deborah said mr clare upwards
so i can help tess with the skimming and as you are very tired i am sure you needn't come down till milkingtime
possibly the talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that afternoon
tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as having light and shade and position but no particular outline
every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her hand trembled the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun
then he pressed her again to his side and when she had done running her forefinger round the leads to cut off the creamedge he cleaned it in nature's way for the unconstrained manners of talbothays dairy came convenient now
i may as well say it now as later dearest he resumed gently
i wish to ask you something of a very practical nature which i have been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads
i shall soon want to marry and being a farmer you see i shall require for my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms
will you be that woman tessy
he put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove
she turned quite careworn
she had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity the necessity of loving him but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary which indeed clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon
with pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman
o mr clarei cannot be your wifei cannot be
the sound of her own decision seemed to break tess's very heart and she bowed her face in her grief
but tess
he said amazed at her reply and holding her still more greedily close
do you say no
surely you love me
o yes yes
and i would rather be yours than anybody's in the world returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl
but i cannot marry you
tess he said holding her at arm's length you are engaged to marry some one else
no no
then why do you refuse me
i don't want to marry
i have not thought of doing it
i cannot
i only want to love you
but why
driven to subterfuge she stammered  your father is a parson and your mother wouldn' like you to marry such as me
she will want you to marry a lady
nonsensei have spoken to them both
that was partly why i went home
i feel i cannotnever never
she echoed
is it too sudden to be asked thus my pretty
yesi did not expect it
if you will let it pass please tessy i will give you time he said
it was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once
i'll not allude to it again for a while
she again took up the shining skimmer held it beneath the pump and began anew
but she could not as at other times hit the exact undersurface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required try as she might sometimes she was cutting down into the milk sometimes in the air
she could hardly see her eyes having filled with two blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which to this her best friend and dear advocate she could never explain
i can't skimi can't
she said turning away from him
not to agitate and hinder her longer the considerate clare began talking in a more general way  you quite misapprehend my parents
they are the most simplemannered people alive and quite unambitious
they are two of the few remaining evangelical school
tessy are you an evangelical
i don't know
you go to church very regularly and our parson here is not very high they tell me
tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman whom she heard every week seemed to be rather more vague than clare's who had never heard him at all
i wish i could fix my mind on what i hear there more firmly than i do she remarked as a safe generality
it is often a great sorrow to me
she spoke so unaffectedly that angel was sure in his heart that his father could not object to her on religious grounds even though she did not know whether her principles were high low or broad
he himself knew that in reality the confused beliefs which she held apparently imbibed in childhood were if anything tractarian as to phraseology and pantheistic as to essence
confused or otherwise to disturb them was his last desire         leave thou thy sister when she prays          her early heaven her happy views          nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse       a life that leads melodious days
he had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical but he gladly conformed to it now
he spoke further of the incidents of his visit of his father's mode of life of his zeal for his principles she grew serener and the undulations disappeared from her skimming as she finished one lead after another he followed her and drew the plugs for letting down the milk
i fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in she ventured to observe anxious to keep away from the subject of herself
yeswell my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles and difficulties and the subject always tends to depress me
he is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a different way of thinking from himself and i don't like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age the more particularly as i don't think earnestness does any good when carried so far
he has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite recently
he went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of trantridge a place forty miles from here and made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about thereson of some landowner up that wayand who has a mother afflicted with blindness
my father addressed himself to the gentleman pointblank and there was quite a disturbance
it was very foolish of my father i must say to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless
but whatever he thinks to be his duty that he'll do in season or out of season and of course he makes many enemies not only among the absolutely vicious but among the easygoing who hate being bothered
he says he glories in what happened and that good may be done indirectly but i wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old and would leave such pigs to their wallowing
tess's look had grown hard and worn and her ripe mouth tragical but she no longer showed any tremulousness
clare's revived thoughts of his father prevented his noticing her particularly and so they went on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and drained them off when the other maids returned and took their pails and deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk
as tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly  and my question tessy
o nono
replied she with grave hopelessness as one who had heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to alec d'urberville
it can't be
she went out towards the mead joining the other milkmaids with a bound as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint
all the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in the farther mead the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild animalsthe reckless unchastened motion of women accustomed to unlimited spacein which they abandoned themselves to the air as a swimmer to the wave
it seemed natural enough to him now that tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained nature and not from the abodes of art
xxviii   her refusal though unexpected did not permanently daunt clare
his experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative and it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of coyness
that she had already permitted him to make love to her he read as an additional assurance not fully trowing that in the fields and pastures to sigh gratis is by no means deemed waste lovemaking being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking anxious homes of the ambitious where a girl's craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end
tess why did you say 'no' in such a positive way
he asked her in the course of a few days
she started
don't ask me
i told you whypartly
i am not good enoughnot worthy enough
how
not fine lady enough
yessomething like that murmured she
your friends would scorn me
indeed you mistake themmy father and mother
as for my brothers i don't care  he clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from slipping away
nowyou did not mean it sweeti am sure you did not
you have made me so restless that i cannot read or play or do anything
i am in no hurry tess but i want to knowto hear from your own warm lipsthat you will some day be mineany time you may choose but some day
she could only shake her head and look away from him
clare regarded her attentively conned the characters of her face as if they had been hieroglyphics
the denial seemed real
then i ought not to hold you in this wayought i
i have no right to youno right to seek out where you are or walk with you
honestly tess do you love any other man
how can you ask
she said with continued selfsuppression
i almost know that you do not
but then why do you repulse me
i don't repulse you
i like you totell me you love me and you may always tell me so as you go about with meand never offend me
but you will not accept me as a husband
ahthat's differentit is for your good indeed my dearest
o believe me it is only for your sake
i don't like to give myself the great happiness o' promising to be yours in that waybecausebecause i am sure i ought not to do it
but you will make me happy
ahyou think so but you don't know
at such times as this apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite he would say that she was wonderfully wellinformed and versatilewhich was certainly true her natural quickness and her admiration for him having led her to pick up his vocabulary his accent and fragments of his knowledge to a surprising extent
after these tender contests and her victory she would go away by herself under the remotest cow if at milkingtime or into the sedge or into her room if at a leisure interval and mourn silently not a minute after an apparently phlegmatic negative
the struggle was so fearful her own heart was so strongly on the side of histwo ardent hearts against one poor little conscience that she tried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power
she had come to talbothays with a madeup mind
on no account could she agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her husband for his blindness in wedding her
and she held that what her conscience had decided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not to be overruled now
why don't somebody tell him all about me
she said
it was only forty miles offwhy hasn't it reached here
somebody must know
yet nobody seemed to know nobody told him
for two or three days no more was said
she guessed from the sad countenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not only as the favourite but as the chosen but they could see for themselves that she did not put herself in his way
tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life was so distinctly twisted of two strands positive pleasure and positive pain
at the next cheesemaking the pair were again left alone together
the dairyman himself had been lending a hand but mr crick as well as his wife seemed latterly to have acquired a suspicion of mutual interest between these two though they walked so circumspectly that suspicion was but of the faintest
anyhow the dairyman left them to themselves
they were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into the vats
the operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large scale and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds tess durbeyfield's hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose
angel who was filling the vats with his handful suddenly ceased and laid his hands flat upon hers
her sleeves were rolled far above the elbow and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft arm
although the early september weather was sultry her arm from her dabbling in the curds was as cold and damp to his mouth as a newgathered mushroom and tasted of the whey
but she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch her blood driven to her finderends and the cool arms flushed hot
then as though her heart had said is coyness longer necessary
truth is truth between man and woman as between man and man she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his as her lip rose in a tender halfsmile
do you know why i did that tess
he said
because you love me very much
yes and as a preliminary to a new entreaty
not again
she looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her own desire
o tessy
he went on i cannot think why you are so tantalizing
why do you disappoint me so
you seem almost like a coquette upon my life you doa coquette of the first urban water
they blow hot and blow cold just as you do and it is the very last sort of thing to expect to find in a retreat like talbothays
  and yet dearest he quickly added observing now the remark had cut her i know you to be the most honest spotless creature that ever lived
so how can i suppose you a flirt
tess why don't you like the idea of being my wife if you love me as you seem to do
i have never said i don't like the idea and i never could say it becauseit isn't true
the stress now getting beyond endurance her lip quivered and she was obliged to go away
clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after and caught her in the passage
tell me tell me
he said passionately clasping her in forgetfulness of his curdy hands do tell me that you won't belong to anybody but me
i will i will tell you
she exclaimed
and i will give you a complete answer if you will let me go now
i will tell you my experiencesall about myselfall
your experiences dear yes certainly any number
he expressed assent in loving satire looking into her face
my tess no doubt almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the garden hedge that opened itself this morning for the first time
tell me anything but don't use that wretched expression any more about not being worthy of me
i will trynot
and i'll give you my reasons tomorrownext week
say on sunday
yes on sunday
at last she got away and did not stop in her retreat till she was in the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton where she could be quite unseen
here tess flung herself down upon the rustling undergrowth of speargrass as upon a bed and remained crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress
in reality she was drifting into acquiescence
every seesaw of her breath every wave of her blood every pulse singing in her ears was a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness
reckless inconsiderate acceptance of him to close with him at the altar revealing nothing and chancing discovery to snatch ripe pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon her that was what love counselled and in almost a terror of ecstasy tess divined that despite her many months of lonely selfchastisement wrestlings communings schemes to lead a future of austere isolation love's counsel would prevail
the afternoon advanced and still she remained among the willows
she heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands the waowwaow
which accompanied the getting together of the cows
but she did not go to the milking
they would see her agitation and the dairyman thinking the cause to be love alone would goodnaturedly tease her and that harassment could not be borne
her lover must have guessed her overwrought state and invented some excuse for her nonappearance for no inquiries were made or calls given
at halfpast six the sun settled down upon the levels with the aspect of a great forge in the heavens and presently a monstrous pumpkinlike moon arose on the other hand
the pollard willows tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings became spinyhaired monsters as they stood up against it
she went in and upstairs without a light
it was now wednesday
thursday came and angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance but intruded in no way upon her
the indoor milkmaids marian and the rest seemed to guess that something definite was afoot for they did not force any remarks upon her in the bedchamber
friday passed saturday
tomorrow was the day
i shall give wayi shall say yesi shall let myself marry himi cannot help it
she jealously panted with her hot face to the pillow that night on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep
i can't bear to let anybody have him but me
yet it is a wrong to him and may kill him when he knows
o my heartooo
xxix   now who mid ye think i've heard news o' this morning
said dairyman crick as he sat down to breakfast next day with a riddling gaze round upon the munching men and maids
now just who mid ye think
one guessed and another guessed
mrs crick did not guess because she knew already
well said the dairyman 'tis that slacktwisted 'hore'sbird of a feller jack dollop
he's lately got married to a widowwoman
not jack dollop
a villainto think o' that
said a milker
the name entered quickly into tess durbeyfield's consciousness for it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart and had afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the butterchurn
and had he married the valiant matron's daughter as he promised
asked angel clare absently as he turned over the newspaper he was reading at the little table to which he was always banished by mrs crick in her sense of his gentility
not he sir
never meant to replied the dairyman
as i say 'tis a widowwoman and she had money it seemsfifty poun' a year or so and that was all he was after
they were married in a great hurry and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun' a year
just fancy the state o' my gentleman's mind at that news
never such a catanddog life as they've been leading ever since
serves him well beright
but onluckily the poor woman gets the worst o't
well the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her first man would trouble him said mrs crick
ay ay responded the dairyman indecisively
still you can see exactly how 'twas
she wanted a home and didn't like to run the risk of losing him
don't ye think that was something like it maidens
he glanced towards the row of girls
she ought to ha' told him just before they went to church when he could hardly have backed out exclaimed marian
yes she ought agreed izz
she must have seen what he was after and should ha' refused him cried retty spasmodically
and what do you say my dear
asked the dairyman of tess
i think she oughtto have told him the true state of thingsor else refused himi don't know replied tess the breadandbutter choking her
be cust if i'd have done either o't said beck knibbs a married helper from one of the cottages
all's fair in love and war
i'd ha' married en just as she did and if he'd said two words to me about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that i hadn't chose to tell i'd ha' knocked him down wi' the rollingpina scram little feller like he
any woman could do it
the laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry smile for form's sake from tess
what was comedy to them was tragedy to her and she could hardly bear their mirth
she soon rose from table and with an impression that clare would soon follow her went along a little wriggling path now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels and now to the other till she stood by the main stream of the var
men had been cutting the waterweeds higher up the river and masses of them were floating past hermoving islands of green crowfoot whereon she might almost have ridden long locks of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from crossing
yes there was the pain of it
this question of a woman telling her storythe heaviest of crosses to herselfseemed but amusement to others
it was as if people should laugh at martyrdom
tessy
came from behind her and clare sprang across the gully alighting beside her feet
my wifesoon
no no i cannot
for your sake o mr clare for your sake i say no
tess
still i say no
she repeated
not expecting this he had put his arm lightly round her waist the moment after speaking beneath her hanging tail of hair
the younger dairymaids including tess breakfasted with their hair loose on sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending church a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows
if she had said yes instead of no he would have kissed her it had evidently been his intention but her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart
their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her as the woman to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse that he felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him
he released her momentarilyimprisoned waist and withheld the kiss
it all turned on that release
what had given her strength to refuse him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman and that would have been overcome in another moment
but angel said no more his face was perplexed he went away
day after day they metsomewhat less constantly than before and thus two or three weeks went by
the end of september drew near and she could see in his eye that he might ask her again
his plan of procedure was different nowas though he had made up his mind that her negatives were after all only coyness and youth startled by the novelty of the proposal
the fitful evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea
so he played a more coaxing game and while never going beyond words or attempting the renewal of caresses he did his utmost orally
in this way clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milkat the cow's side at skimmings at buttermakings at cheesemakings among broody poultry and among farrowing pigsas no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man
tess knew that she must break down
neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer
she loved him so passionately and he was so godlike in her eyes and being though untrained instinctively refined her nature cried for his tutelary guidance
and thus though tess kept repeating to herself i can never be his wife the words were vain
a proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble to formulate
every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss and she coveted the recantation she feared
his manner waswhat man's is notso much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions changes charges or revelations that her gloom lessened as she basked in it
the season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox and though it was still fine the days were much shorter
the dairy had again worked by morning candlelight for a long time and a fresh renewal of clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four
she had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual then had gone back to dress and call the others and in ten minutes was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand
at the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirtsleeves and put his arm across the stairway
now miss flirt before you go down he said peremptorily
it is a fortnight since i spoke and this won't do any longer
you must tell me what you mean or i shall have to leave this house
my door was ajar just now and i saw you
for your own safety i must go
you don't know
well
is it to be yes at last
i am only just up mr clare and it is too early to take me to task
she pouted
you need not call me flirt
'tis cruel and untrue
wait till by and by
please wait till by and by
i will really think seriously about it between now and then
let me go downstairs
she looked a little like what he said she was as holding the candle sideways she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words
call me angel then and not mr clare
angel
angel dearestwhy not
'twould mean that i agree wouldn't it
it would only mean that you love me even if you cannot marry me and you were so good as to own that long ago
very well then 'angel dearest' if i must she murmured looking at her candle a roguish curl coming upon her mouth notwithstanding her suspense
clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise but somehow as tess stood there in her prettily tuckedup milking gown her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done he broke his resolve and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment
she passed downstairs very quickly never looking back at him or saying another word
the other maids were already down and the subject was not pursued
except marian they all looked wistfully and suspiciously at the pair in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals of the dawn without
when skimming was donewhich as the milk diminished with the approach of autumn was a lessening process day by dayretty and the rest went out
the lovers followed them
our tremulous lives are so different from theirs are they not
he musingly observed to her as he regarded the three figures tripping before him through the frigid pallor of opening day
not so very different i think she said
why do you think that
there are very few women's lives that are nottremulous tess replied pausing over the new word as if it impressed her
there's more in those three than you think
what is in them
almost either of 'em she began would makeperhaps would makea properer wife than i
and perhaps they love you as well as ialmost
o tessy
there were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the impatient exclamation though she had resolved so intrepidly to let generosity make one bid against herself
that was now done and she had not the power to attempt selfimmolation a second time then
they were joined by a milker from one of the cottages and no more was said on that which concerned them so deeply
but tess knew that this day would decide it
in the afternoon several of the dairyman's household and assistants went down to the meads as usual a long way from the dairy where many of the cows were milked without being driven home
the supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf and the supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed
the work progressed leisurely
each pailful was poured into tall cans that stood in a large springwaggon which had been brought upon the scene and when they were milked the cows trailed away
dairyman crick who was there with the rest his wrapper gleaming miraculously white against a leaden evening sky suddenly looked at his heavy watch
why 'tis later than i thought he said
begad
we shan't be soon enough with this milk at the station if we don't mind
there's no time today to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off
it must go to station straight from here
who'll drive it across
mr clare volunteered to do so though it was none of his business asking tess to accompany him
the evening though sunless had been warm and muggy for the season and tess had come out with her milkinghood only nakedarmed and jacketless certainly not dressed for a drive
she therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments but clare gently urged her
she assented by relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home and mounted the springwaggon beside clare
xxx   in the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through the meads which stretched away into gray miles and were backed in the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of egdon heath
on its summit stood clumps and stretches of firtrees whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning blackfronted castles of enchantment
they were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that they did not begin talking for a long while the silence being broken only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them
the lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells and the blackberries hung in heavy clusters
every now and then angel would fling the lash of his whip round one of these pluck it off and give it to his companion
the dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down heralddrops of rain and the stagnant air of the day changed into a fitful breeze which played about their faces
the quicksilvery glaze on the rivers and pools vanished from broad mirrors of light they changed to lustreless sheets of lead with a surface like a rasp
but that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation
her countenance a natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season had deepened its tinge with the beating of the raindrops and her hair which the pressure of the cows' flanks had as usual caused to tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her calico bonnet was made clammy by the moisture till it hardly was better than seaweed
i ought not to have come i suppose she murmured looking at the sky
i am sorry for the rain said he
but how glad i am to have you here
remote egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze
the evening grew darker and the roads being crossed by gates it was not safe to drive faster than at a walking pace
the air was rather chill
i am so afraid you will get cold with nothing upon your arms and shoulders he said
creep close to me and perhaps the drizzle won't hurt you much
i should be sorrier still if i did not think that the rain might be helping me
she imperceptibly crept closer and he wrapped round them both a large piece of sailcloth which was sometimes used to keep the sun off the milkcans
tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself clare's hands being occupied
now we are all right again
ahno we are not
it runs down into my neck a little and it must still more into yours
that's better
your arms are like wet marble tess
wipe them in the cloth
now if you stay quiet you will not get another drop
well dearabout that question of minethat longstanding question
the only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of the horse's hoofs on the moistening road and the cluck of the milk in the cans behind them
do you remember what you said
i do she replied
before we get home mind
i'll try
he said no more then
as they drove on the fragment of an old manor house of caroline date rose against the sky and was in due course passed and left behind
that he observed to entertain her is an interesting old placeone of the several seats which belonged to an ancient norman family formerly of great influence in this county the d'urbervilles
i never pass one of their residences without thinking of them
there is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown even if it was fierce domineering feudal renown
yes said tess
they crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence a spot where by day a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between their secluded world and modern life
modern life stretched out its steam feeler to this point three or four times a day touched the native existences and quickly withdrew its feeler again as if what it touched had been uncongenial
they reached the feeble light which came from the smoky lamp of a little railway station a poor enough terrestrial star yet in one sense of more importance to talbothays dairy and mankind than the celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast
the cans of new milk were unladen in the rain tess getting a little shelter from a neighbouring holly tree
then there was the hissing of a train which drew up almost silently upon the wet rails and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the truck
the light of the engine flashed for a second upon tess durbeyfield's figure motionless under the great holly tree
no object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than this unsophisticated girl with the round bare arms the rainy face and hair the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause the print gown of no date or fashion and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow
she mounted again beside her lover with a mute obedience characteristic of impassioned natures at times and when they had wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again they plunged back into the now thick night
tess was so receptive that the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in her thought
londoners will drink it at their breakfasts tomorrow won't they
she asked
strange people that we have never seen
yesi suppose they will
though not as we send it
when its strength has been lowered so that it may not get up into their heads
noble men and noble women ambassadors and centurions ladies and tradeswomen and babies who have never seen a cow
well yes perhaps particularly centurions
who don't know anything of us and where it comes from or think how we two drove miles across the moor tonight in the rain that it might reach 'em in time
we did not drive entirely on account of these precious londoners we drove a little on our ownon account of that anxious matter which you will i am sure set at rest dear tess
now permit me to put it in this way
you belong to me already you know your heart i mean
does it not
you know as well as i  o yesyes
then if your heart does why not your hand
my only reason was on account of youon account of a question
i have something to tell you  but suppose it to be entirely for my happiness and my worldly convenience also
o yes if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience
but my life before i came herei want  well it is for my convenience as well as my happiness
if i have a very large farm either english or colonial you will be invaluable as a wife to me better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the country
so pleaseplease dear tessy disabuse your mind of the feeling that you will stand in my way
but my history
i want you to know ityou must let me tell youyou will not like me so well
tell it if you wish to dearest
this precious history then
yes i was born at so and so anno domini  i was born at marlott she said catching at his words as a help lightly as they were spoken
and i grew up there
and i was in the sixth standard when i left school and they said i had great aptness and should make a good teacher so it was settled that i should be one
but there was trouble in my family father was not very industrious and he drank a little
yes yes
poor child
nothing new
he pressed her more closely to his side
and thenthere is something very unusual about itabout me
ii was  tess's breath quickened
yes dearest
never mind
iiam not a durbeyfield but a d'urbervillea descendant of the same family as those that owned the old house we passed
andwe are all gone to nothing
a d'urbervilleindeed
and is that all the trouble dear tess
yes she answered faintly
wellwhy should i love you less after knowing this
i was told by the dairyman that you hated old families
he laughed
well it is true in one sense
i do hate the aristocratic principle of blood before everything and do think that as reasoners the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and virtuous without regard to corporal paternity
but i am extremely interested in this newsyou can have no idea how interested i am
are you not interested yourself in being one of that wellknown line
no
i have thought it sadespecially since coming here and knowing that many of the hills and fields i see once belonged to my father's people
but other hills and field belonged to retty's people and perhaps others to marian's so that i don't value it particularly
yesit is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were once owners of it and i sometimes wonder that a certain school of politicians don't make capital of the circumstance but they don't seem to know it
i wonder that i did not see the resemblance of your name to d'urberville and trace the manifest corruption
and this was the carking secret
she had not told
at the last moment her courage had failed her she feared his blame for not telling him sooner and her instinct of selfpreservation was stronger than her candour
of course continued the unwitting clare i should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the longsuffering dumb unrecorded rank and file of the english nation and not from the selfseeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest
but i am corrupted away from that by my affection for you tess he laughed as he spoke and made selfish likewise
for your own sake i rejoice in your descent
society is hopelessly snobbish and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife after i have made you the wellread woman that i mean to make you
my mother too poor soul will think so much better of you on account of it
tess you must spell your name correctlyd'urbervillefrom this very day
i like the other way rather best
but you must dearest
good heavens why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession
by the bye there's one of that kidney who has taken the namewhere have i heard of himup in the neighbourhood of the chase i think
why he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father i told you of
what an odd coincidence
angel i think i would rather not take the name
it is unlucky perhaps
she was agitated
now then mistress teresa d'urberville i have you
take my name and so you will escape yours
the secret is out so why should you any longer refuse me
if it is sure to make you happy to have me as your wife and you feel that you do wish to marry me very very much  i do dearest of course
i mean that it is only your wanting me very much and being hardly able to keep alive without me whatever my offences that would make me feel i ought to say i will
you willyou do say it i know
you will be mine for ever and ever
he clasped her close and kissed her
yes
she had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing so violent that it seemed to rend her
tess was not a hysterical girl by any means and he was surprised
why do you cry dearest
i can't tellquitei am so glad to thinkof being yours and making you happy
but this does not seem very much like gladness my tessy
i meani cry because i have broken down in my vow
i said i would die unmarried
but if you love me you would like me to be your husband
yes yes yes
but o i sometimes wish i had never been born
now my dear tess if i did not know that you are very much excited and very inexperienced i should say that remark was not very complimentary
how came you to wish that if you care for me
do you care for me
i wish you would prove it in some way
how can i prove it more than i have done
she cried in a distraction of tenderness
will this prove it more
she clasped his neck and for the first time clare learnt what an impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she loved with all her heart and soul as tess loved him
therenow do you believe
she asked flushed and wiping her eyes
yes
i never really doubtednever never
so they drove on through the gloom forming one bundle inside the sailcloth the horse going as he would and the rain driving against them
she had consented
she might as well have agreed at first
the appetite for joy which pervades all creation that tremendous force which sways humanity to its purpose as the tide sways the helpless weed was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social rubric
i must write to my mother she said
you don't mind my doing that
of course not dear child
you are a child to me tess not to know how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time and how wrong it would be in me to object
where does she live
at the same placemarlott
on the further side of blackmoor vale
ah then i have seen you before this summer  yes at that dance on the green but you would not dance with me
o i hope that is of no illomen for us now
xxxi   tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very next day and by the end of the week a response to her communication arrived in joan durbeyfield's wandering lastcentury hand
dear tess     j write these few lines hoping they will find you well    as they leave me at present thank god for it
dear    tess we are all glad to hear that you are going really    to be married soon
but with respect to your question    tess j say between ourselves quite private but very    strong that on no account do you say a word of your    bygone trouble to him
j did not tell everything    to your father he being so proud on account of his    respectability which perhaps your intended is    the same
many a womansome of the highest in the    landhave had a trouble in their time and why should    you trumpet yours when others don't trumpet theirs
no    girl would be such a fool specially as it is so long    ago and not your fault at all
j shall answer the    same if you ask me fifty times
besides you must bear    in mind that knowing it to be your childish nature to    tell all that's in your heartso simplej made you    promise me never to let it out by word or deed having    your welfare in my mind and you most solemnly did    promise it going from this door
j have not named    either that question or your coming marriage to your    father as he would blab it everywhere poor simple    man
dear tess keep up your spirits and we mean to send    you a hogshead of cyder for you wedding knowing there    is not much in your parts and thin sour stuff what    there is
so no more at present and with kind love    to your young manfrom your affectte
mother     j durbeyfield   o mother mother
murmured tess
she was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most oppressive upon mrs durbeyfield's elastic spirit
her mother did not see life as tess saw it
that haunting episode of bygone days was to her mother but a passing accident
but perhaps her mother was right as to the course to be followed whatever she might be in her reasons
silence seemed on the face of it best for her adored one's happiness silence it should be
thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had any shadow of right to control her action tess grew calmer
the responsibility was shifted and her heart was lighter than it had been for weeks
the days of declining autumn which followed her assent beginning with the month of october formed a season through which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any other period of her life
there was hardly a touch of earth in her love for clare
to her sublime trustfulness he was all that goodness could beknew all that a guide philosopher and friend should know
she thought every line in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty his soul the soul of a saint his intellect that of a seer
the wisdom of her love for him as love sustained her dignity she seemed to be wearing a crown
the compassion of his love for her as she saw it made her lift up her heart to him in devotion
he would sometimes catch her large worshipful eyes that had no bottom to them looking at him from their depths as if she saw something immortal before her
she dismissed the pasttrod upon it and put it out as one treads on a coal that is smouldering and dangerous
she had not known that men could be so disinterested chivalrous protective in their love for women as he
angel clare was far from all that she thought him in this respect absurdly far indeed but he was in truth more spiritual than animal he had himself well in hand and was singularly free from grossness
though not coldnatured he was rather bright than hotless byronic than shelleyan could love desperately but with a love more especially inclined to the imaginative and ethereal it was a fastidious emotion which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self
this amazed and enraptured tess whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till now and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for clare
they unaffectedly sought each other's company in her honest faith she did not disguise her desire to be with him
the sum of her instincts on this matter if clearly stated would have been that the elusive quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love since it must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art
the country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during betrothal was the only custom she knew and to her it had no strangeness though it seemed oddly anticipative to clare till he saw how normal a thing she in common with all the other dairyfolk regarded it
thus during this october month of wonderful afternoons they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the brinks of trickling tributary brooks hopping across by little wooden bridges to the other side and back again
they were never out of the sound of some purling weir whose buzz accompanied their own murmuring while the beams of the sun almost as horizontal as the mead itself formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape
they saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges all the time that there was bright sunshine elsewhere
the sun was so near the ground and the sward so flat that the shadows of clare and tess would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them like two long fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale
men were at work here and therefor it was the season for taking up the meadows or digging the little waterways clear for the winter irrigation and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows
the shovelfuls of loam black as jet brought there by the river when it was as wide as the whole valley were an essence of soils pounded champaigns of the past steeped refined and subtilized to extraordinary richness out of which came all the fertility of the mead and of the cattle grazing there
clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen with the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance though actually as shy as she who with lips parted and eyes askance on the labourers wore the look of a wary animal the while
you are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them
she said gladly
o no
but if it should reach the ears of your friends at emminster that you are walking about like this with me a milkmaid  the most bewitching milkmaid ever seen
they might feel it a hurt to their dignity
my dear girla d'urberville hurt the dignity of a clare
it is a grand card to playthat of your belonging to such a family and i am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married and have the proofs of your descent from parson tringham
apart from that my future is to be totally foreign to my familyit will not affect even the surface of their lives
we shall leave this part of englandperhaps england itselfand what does it matter how people regard us here
you will like going will you not
she could answer no more than a bare affirmative so great was the emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with him as his own familiar friend
her feelings almost filled her ears like a babble of waves and surged up to her eyes
she put her hand in his and thus they went on to a place where the reflected sun glared up from the river under a bridge with a moltenmetallic glow that dazzled their eyes though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge
they stood still whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water but finding that the disturbing presences had paused and not passed by they disappeared again
upon this riverbrink they lingered till the fog began to close round themwhich was very early in the evening at this time of the yearsettling on the lashes of her eyes where it rested like crystals and on his brows and hair
they walked later on sundays when it was quite dark
some of the dairypeople who were also out of doors on the first sunday evening after their engagement heard her impulsive speeches ecstasized to fragments though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks broken into syllables by the leapings of her heart as she walked leaning on his arm her contented pauses the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to ridethe laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won from all other womenunlike anything else in nature
they marked the buoyancy of her tread like the skim of a bird which has not quite alighted
her affection for him was now the breath and life of tess's being it enveloped her as a photosphere irradiated her into forgetfulness of her past sorrows keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist in their attempts to touch herdoubt fear moodiness care shame
she knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing light but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry subjection there
a spiritual forgetfulness coexisted with an intellectual remembrance
she walked in brightness but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread
they might be receding or they might be approaching one or the other a little every day
one evening tess and clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house all the other occupants of the domicile being away
as they talked she looked thoughtfully up at him and met his two appreciative eyes
i am not worthy of youno i am not
she burst out jumping up from her low stool as though appalled at his homage and the fulness of her own joy thereat
clare deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was only the smaller part of it said  i won't have you speak like it dear tess
distinction does not consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions but in being numbered among those who are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of good reportas you are my tess
she struggled with the sob in her throat
how often had that string of excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years and how strange that he should have cited them now
why didn't you stay and love me when iwas sixteen living with my little sisters and brothers and you danced on the green
o why didn't you why didn't you
she said impetuously clasping her hands
angel began to comfort and reassure her thinking to himself truly enough what a creature of moods she was and how careful he would have to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him
ahwhy didn't i stay
he said
that is just what i feel
if i had only known
but you must not be so bitter in your regretwhy should you be
with the woman's instinct to hide she diverged hastily  i should have had four years more of your heart than i can ever have now
then i should not have wasted my time as i have donei should have had so much longer happiness
it was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her who was tormented thus but a girl of simple life not yet oneand twenty who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird in a springe
to calm herself the more completely she rose from her little stool and left the room overturning the stool with her skirts as she went
he sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green ashsticks laid across the dogs the sticks snapped pleasantly and hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends
when she came back she was herself again
do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious fitful tess
he said goodhumouredly as he spread a cushion for her on the stool and seated himself in the settle beside her
i wanted to ask you something and just then you ran away
yes perhaps i am capricious she murmured
she suddenly approached him and put a hand upon each of his arms
no angel i am not really soby nature i mean
the more particularly to assure him that she was not she placed herself close to him in the settle and allowed her head to find a restingplace against clare's shoulder
what did you want to ask mei am sure i will answer it she continued humbly
well you love me and have agreed to marry me and hence there follows a thirdly 'when shall the day be'
i like living like this
but i must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new year or a little later
and before i get involved in the multifarious details of my new position i should like to have secured my partner
but she timidly answered to talk quite practically wouldn't it be best not to marry till after all thatthough i can't bear the thought o' your going away and leaving me here
of course you cannotand it is not best in this case
i want you to help me in many ways in making my start
when shall it be
why not a fortnight from now
no she said becoming grave i have so many things to think of first
but  he drew her gently nearer to him
the reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near
before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment mr dairyman crick mrs crick and two of the milkmaids
tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet while her face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight
i knew how it would be if i sat so close to him
she cried with vexation
i said to myself they are sure to come and catch us
but i wasn't really sitting on his knee though it might ha' seemed as if i was almost
wellif so be you hadn't told us i am sure we shouldn't ha' noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light replied the dairyman
he continued to his wife with the stolid mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimonynow christianer that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't
o no i should never ha' thought a word of where she was a sitting to if she hadn't told menot i
we are going to be married soon said clare with improvised phlegm
ahand be ye
well i am truly glad to hear it sir
i've thought you mid do such a thing for some time
she's too good for a dairymaidi said so the very first day i zid herand a prize for any man and what's more a wonderful woman for a gentlemanfarmer's wife he won't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side
somehow tess disappeared
she had been even more struck with the look of the girls who followed crick than abashed by crick's blunt praise
after supper when she reached her bedroom they were all present
a light was burning and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed awaiting tess the whole like a row of avenging ghosts
but she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood
they could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have
their condition was objective contemplative
he's going to marry her
murmured retty never taking eyes off tess
how her face do show it
you be going to marry him
asked marian
yes said tess
when
some day
they thought that this was evasiveness only
yesgoing to marry hima gentleman
repeated izz huett
and by a sort of fascination the three girls one after another crept out of their beds and came and stood barefooted round tess
retty put her hands upon tess's shoulders as if to realize her friend's corporeality after such a miracle and the other two laid their arms round her waist all looking into her face
how it do seem
almost more than i can think of
said izz huett
marian kissed tess
yes she murmured as she withdrew her lips
was that because of love for her or because other lips have touched there by now
continued izz drily to marian
i wasn't thinking o' that said marian simply
i was on'y feeling all the strangeness o'tthat she is to be his wife and nobody else
i don't say nay to it nor either of us because we did not think of itonly loved him
still nobody else is to marry'n in the worldno fine lady nobody in silks and satins but she who do live like we
are you sure you don't dislike me for it
said tess in a low voice
they hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying as if they considered their answer might lie in her look
i don't knowi don't know murmured retty priddle
i want to hate 'ee but i cannot
that's how i feel echoed izz and marian
i can't hate her
somehow she hinders me
he ought to marry one of you murmured tess
why
you are all better than i
we better than you
said the girls in a low slow whisper
no no dear tess
you are
she contradicted impetuously
and suddenly tearing away from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly o yes yes yes
having once given way she could not stop her weeping
he ought to have had one of you
she cried
i think i ought to make him even now
you would be better for him thani don't know what i'm saying
o
o
they went up to her and clasped her round but still her sobs tore her
get some water said marian  she's upset by us poor thing poor thing
they gently led her back to the side of her bed where they kissed her warmly
you are best for'n said marian
more ladylike and a better scholar than we especially since he had taught 'ee so much
but even you ought to be proud
you be proud i'm sure
yes i am she said and i am ashamed at so breaking down
when they were all in bed and the light was out marian whispered across to her  you will think of us when you be his wife tess and of how we told 'ee that we loved him and how we tried not to hate you and did not hate you and could not hate you because you were his choice and we never hoped to be chose by him
they were not aware that at these words salt stinging tears trickled down upon tess's pillow anew and how she resolved with a bursting heart to tell all her history to angel clare despite her mother's commandto let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would and her mother regard her as a fool rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him and which somehow seemed a wrong to these
xxxii   this penitential mood kept her from naming the weddingday
the beginning of november found its date still in abeyance though he asked her at the most tempting times
but tess's desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then
the meads were changing now but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile and the state of dairywork at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling
looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary like the track of moonlight on the sea
gnats knowing nothing of their brief glorification wandered across the shimmer of this pathway irradiated as if they bore fire within them then passed out of its line and were quite extinct
in the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question
or he would ask her at night when he accompanied her on some mission invented by mrs crick to give him the opportunity
this was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the strawbarton to which they were relegated
for it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine
batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lyingin hospital where they lived on straw till their calves were born after which event and as soon as the calf could walk mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy
in the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was of course little milking to be done but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual
returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravelcliff immediately over the levels where they stood still and listened
the water was now high in the streams squirting through the weirs and tinkling under culverts the smallest gullies were all full there was no taking short cuts anywhere and footpassengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways
from the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace
it seems like tens of thousands of them said tess holding publicmeetings in their marketplaces arguing preaching quarrelling sobbing groaning praying and cursing
clare was not particularly heeding
did crick speak to you today dear about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months
no
the cows are going dry rapidly
yes
six or seven went to the strawbarton yesterday and three the day before making nearly twenty in the straw already
ahis it that the farmer don't want my help for the calving
o i am not wanted here any more
and i have tried so hard to  crick didn't exactly say that he would no longer require you
but knowing what our relations were he said in the most goodnatured and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at christmas i should take you with me and on my asking what he would do without you he merely observed that as a matter of fact it was a time of year when he could do with a very little female help
i am afraid i was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand
i don't think you ought to have felt glad angel
because 'tis always mournful not to be wanted even if at the same time 'tis convenient
well it is convenientyou have admitted that
he put his finger upon her cheek
ah
he said
what
i feel the red rising up at her having been caught
but why should i trifle so
we will not triflelife is too serious
it is
perhaps i saw that before you did
she was seeing it then
to decline to marry him after allin obedience to her emotion of last nightand leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calvingtime was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was
she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home
so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property
besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever
i wish we could
that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summertime
i always shall
o i know you will
she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him
angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always
thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left
when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly toldwith injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible
the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her
what should he do about his skimming
who would make the ornamental butterpats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies
mrs crick congratulated tess on the shillyshallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn
in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and goodlooking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge
tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will
the word had been given the number of the day written down
her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to fieldfolk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellowcreatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind
but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the weddingday really to again implore her advice
it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered
a postnuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him
but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield
despite angel clare's plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date
he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him
he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes
unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here
yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life
the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family
don't you think 'twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm
she once asked timidly
a midland farm was the idea just then
to tell the truth my tess i don't like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy
the reason was a good one so far as it went
his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions
and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him
he wished to have her under his charge for another reason
his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement english or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months' life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordealher presentation to his mother at the vicarage
next he wished to see a little of the working of a flourmill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corngrowing
the proprietor of a large old watermill at wellbridgeonce the mill of an abbeyhad offered him the inspection of his timehonoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come
clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to talbothays in the evening
she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge flourmills
and what had determined him
less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the d'urberville family
this was always how clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them
they decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns
then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of london that i have heard of he said and by march or april we will pay a visit to my father and mother
questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future
the thirtyfirst of december new year's eve was the date
his wife she said to herself
could it ever be
their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not
and yet why
one sunday morning izz huett returned from church and spoke privately to tess
you was not called home this morning
what
it should ha' been the first time of asking today she answered looking quietly at tess
you meant to be married new year's eve deary
the other returned a quick affirmative
and there must be three times of asking
and now there be only two sundays left between
tess felt her cheek paling izz was right of course there must be three
perhaps he had forgotten
if so there must be a week's postponement and that was unlucky
how could she remind her lover
she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize
a natural incident relieved her anxiety
izz mentioned the omission of the banns to mrs crick and mrs crick assumed a matron's privilege of speaking to angel on the point
have ye forgot 'em mr clare
the banns i mean
no i have not forgot 'em says clare
as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her  don't let them tease you about the banns
a licence will be quieter for us and i have decided on a licence without consulting you
so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to
i didn't wish to hear it dearest she said proudly
but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess notwithstanding who had wellnigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history
how events were favouring her
i don't quite feel easy she said to herself
all this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill  that's how heaven mostly does
i wish i could have had common banns
but everything went smoothly
she wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one
the question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her
inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned
he entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them
a minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes
how thoughtful you've been
she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder
even to the gloves and handkerchief
my own lovehow good how kind
no no tess just an order to a tradeswoman in londonnothing more
and to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations
she did return upstairs and put on the gown
alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mother's ballad of the mystic robe        that never would become that wife        that had once done amiss   which mrs durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune
suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed queen guinevere
since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now
xxxiii   angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them
during the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together
clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class
for months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairyman's cob or gig if he rode or drove
they went in the gig that day
and then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern
it was christmas eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day
tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm
in the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and tess waited in the entry while angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door
the general sittingroom was full of guests who were continually going in and out
as the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon tess's face
two men came out and passed by her among the rest
one of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that trantridge folk were rarities here
a comely maid that said the other
true comely enough
but unless i make a great mistake  and he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith
clare had just returned from the stableyard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of tess
the insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage
the man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence
but his opponent began to think better of the matter
he looked anew at tess as he passed her and said to clare  i beg pardon sir 'twas a complete mistake
i thought she was another woman forty miles from here
clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an innpassage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night
as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction
and was it a mistake
said the second one
not a bit of it
but i didn't want to hurt the gentleman's feelingsnot i
in the meantime the lovers were driving onward
could we put off our wedding till a little later
tess asked in a dry dull voice
i mean if we wished
no my love
calm yourself
do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault
he asked goodhumouredly
noi only meantif it should have to be put off
what she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could
but she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought we shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there
they parted tenderly that night on the landing and clare ascended to his attic
tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time
while she sat she heard a noise in angel's room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling
everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter
oh nothing dear he said from within
i am so sorry i disturbed you
but the reason is rather an amusing one i fell asleep and dreamt that i was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which i pulled out today for packing
i am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep
go to bed and think of it no more
this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision
declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way
she sat down and wrote on the four pages of a notesheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to clare
then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door
her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead
it came as usual he descended as usual
she descended
he met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her
surely it was as warmly as ever
he looked a little disturbed and worn she thought
but he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone
could he have had it
unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing
so the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself
yet he was frank and affectionate as before
could it be that her doubts were childish
that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare
had he really received her note
she glanced into his room and could see nothing of it
it might be that he forgave her
but even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her
every morning and night he was the same and thus new year's eve brokethe wedding day
the lovers did not rise at milkingtime having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests tess being honoured with a room of her own
when they arrived downstairs at breakfasttime they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it
at some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimneycorner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there
this renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment
i was determined to do summat in honour o't said the dairyman
and as you wouldn't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi' fiddles and bassviols complete as we should ha' done in old times this was all i could think o' as a noiseless thing
tess's friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from marlott
as for angel's family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come
his brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughterinlaw they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge
this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long
to produce tess fresh from the dairy as a d'urberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line
it was a pretty lover's dream if no more
perhaps tess's lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside
her perception that angel's bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it
she rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs
it had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been clare's den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering
she stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement
the carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door
with a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter
there it wassealed up just as it had left her hands
the mountain had not yet been removed
she could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there
she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious
the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time
yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and mrs crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was wellnigh impossible
the only minute tess could get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing
i am so anxious to talk to youi want to confess all my faults and blunders
she said with attempted lightness
no nowe can't have faults talked ofyou must be deemed perfect today at least my sweet
he cried
we shall have plenty of time hereafter i hope to talk over our failings
i will confess mine at the same time
but it would be better for me to do it now i think so that you could not say  well my quixotic one you shall tell me anythingsay as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now
i too will tell you my faults then
but do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time
then you don't wish me to dearest
i do not tessy really
the hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this
those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection
she was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation
her one desire so long resisted to make herself his to call him her lord her ownthen if necessary to diehad at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway
in dressing she moved about in a mental cloud of manycoloured idealities which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness
the church was a long way off and they were obliged to drive particularly as it was winter
a closed carriage was ordered from a roadside inn a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of postchaise travelling
it had stout wheelspokes and heavy felloes a great curved bed immense straps and springs and a pole like a batteringram
the postilion was a venerable boy of sixtya martyr to rheumatic gout the result of excessive exposure in youth counteracted by strong liquorswho had stood at inndoors doing nothing for the whole fiveandtwenty years that had elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride professionally as if expecting the old times to come back again
he had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg originated by the constant bruisings of aristocratic carriagepoles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the king's arms casterbridge
inside this cumbrous and creaking structure and behind this decayed conductor the partie carre took their seatsthe bride and bridegroom and mr and mrs crick
angel would have liked one at least of his brothers to be present as groomsman but their silence after his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not care to come
they disapproved of the marriage and could not be expected to countenance it
perhaps it was as well that they could not be present
they were not worldly young fellows but fraternizing with dairyfolk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness apart from their views of the match
upheld by the momentum of the time tess knew nothing of this did not see anything did not know the road they were taking to the church
she knew that angel was close to her all the rest was a luminous mist
she was a sort of celestial person who owed her being to poetryone of those classical divinities clare was accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together
the marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people in the church had there been a thousand they would have produced no more effect upon her
they were at stellar distances from her present world
in the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy
at a pause in the service while they were kneeling together she unconsciously inclined herself towards him so that her shoulder touched his arm she had been frightened by a passing thought and the movement had been automatic to assure herself that he was really there and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof against all things
clare knew that she loved himevery curve of her form showed that but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion its singlemindedness its meekness what longsuffering it guaranteed what honesty what endurance what good faith
as they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests and a modest peal of three notes broke forththat limited amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the joys of such a small parish
passing by the tower with her husband on the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound and it matched the highlycharged mental atmosphere in which she was living
this condition of mind wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation not her own like the angel whom st john saw in the sun lasted till the sound of the church bells had died away and the emotions of the weddingservice had calmed down
her eyes could dwell upon details more clearly now and mr and mrs crick having directed their own gig to be sent for them to leave the carriage to the young couple she observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first time
sitting in silence she regarded it long
i fancy you seem oppressed tessy said clare
yes she answered putting her hand to her brow
i tremble at many things
it is all so serious angel
among other things i seem to have seen this carriage before to be very well acquainted with it
it is very oddi must have seen it in a dream
ohyou have heard the legend of the d'urberville coachthat wellknown superstition of this county about your family when they were very popular here and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it
i have never heard of it to my knowledge said she
what is the legendmay i know it
welli would rather not tell it in detail just now
a certain d'urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach wheneverbut i'll tell you another dayit is rather gloomy
evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan
i don't remember hearing it before she murmured
is it when we are going to die angel that members of my family see it or is it when we have committed a crime
now tess
he silenced her by a kiss
by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless
she was mrs angel clare indeed but had she any moral right to the name
was she not more truly mrs alexander d'urberville
could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence
she knew not what was expected of women in such cases and she had no counsellor
however when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutesthe last day this on which she was ever to enter itshe knelt down and prayed
she tried to pray to god but it was her husband who really had her supplication
her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be illomened
she was conscious of the notion expressed by friar laurence these violent delights have violent ends
it might be too desperate for human conditionstoo rank to wild too deadly
o my love why do i love you so
she whispered there alone for she you love is not my real self but one in my image the one i might have been
afternoon came and with it the hour for departure
they had decided to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old farmhouse near wellbridge mill at which he meant to reside during his investigation of flour processes
at two o'clock there was nothing left to do but to start
all the servantry of the dairy were standing in the redbrick entry to see them go out the dairyman and his wife following to the door
tess saw her three chambermates in a row against the wall pensively inclining their heads
she had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment but there they were stoical and staunch to the last
she knew why the delicate retty looked so fragile and izz so tragically sorrowful and marian so blank and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a moment in contemplating theirs
she impulsively whispered to him  will you kiss 'em all once poor things for the first and last time
clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formalitywhich was all that it was to himand as he passed them he kissed them in succession where they stood saying goodbye to each as he did so
when they reached the door tess femininely glanced back to discern the effect of that kiss of charity there was no triumph in her glance as there might have been
if there had it would have disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were
the kiss had obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue
of all this clare was unconscious
passing on to the wicketgate he shook hands with the dairyman and his wife and expressed his last thanks to them for their attentions after which there was a moment of silence before they had moved off
it was interrupted by the crowing of a cock
the white one with the rose comb had come and settled on the palings in front of the house within a few yards of them and his notes thrilled their ears through dwindling away like echoes down a valley of rocks
oh
said mrs crick
an afternoon crow
two men were standing by the yard gate holding it open
that's bad one murmured to the other not thinking that the words could be heard by the group at the doorwicket
the cock crew againstraight towards clare
well
said the dairyman
i don't like to hear him
said tess to her husband
tell the man to drive on
goodbye goodbye
the cock crew again
hoosh
just you be off sir or i'll twist your neck
said the dairyman with some irritation turning to the bird and driving him away
and to his wife as they went indoors now to think o' that just today
i've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore
it only means a change in the weather said she not what you think 'tis impossible
xxxiv   they drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few miles and reaching wellbridge turned away from the village to the left and over the great elizabethan bridge which gives the place half its name
immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged lodgings whose exterior features are so well known to all travellers through the froom valley once portion of a fine manorial residence and the property and seat of a d'urberville but since its partial demolition a farmhouse
welcome to one of your ancestral mansions
said clare as he handed her down
but he regretted the pleasantry it was too near a satire
on entering they found that though they had only engaged a couple of rooms the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during the coming days to pay a new year's visit to some friends leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants
the absoluteness of possession pleased them and they realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own exclusive rooftree
but he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his bride
when the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash their hands the charwoman showing the way
on the landing tess stopped and started
what's the matter
said he
those horrid women
she answered with a smile
how they frightened me
he looked up and perceived two lifesize portraits on panels built into the masonry
as all visitors to the mansion are aware these paintings represent women of middle age of a date some two hundred years ago whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten
the long pointed features narrow eye and smirk of the one so suggestive of merciless treachery the billhook nose large teeth and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams
whose portraits are those
asked clare of the charwoman
i have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d'urberville family the ancient lords of this manor she said owing to their being builded into the wall they can't be moved away
the unpleasantness of the matter was that in addition to their effect upon tess her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these exaggerated forms
he said nothing of this however and regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal time went on into the adjoining room
the place having been rather hastily prepared for them they washed their hands in one basin
clare touched hers under the water
which are my fingers and which are yours
he said looking up
they are very much mixed
they are all yours said she very prettily and endeavoured to be gayer than she was
he had not been displeased with her thoughtfulness on such an occasion it was what every sensible woman would show but tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess and struggled against it
the sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which stretched across to her skirt where it made a spot like a paintmark set upon her
they went into the ancient parlour to tea and here they shared their first common meal alone
such was their childishness or rather his that he found it interesting to use the same breadandbutter plate as herself and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own
he wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest
looking at her silently for a long time she is a dear dear tess he thought to himself as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage
do i realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune
i think not
i think i could not unless i were a woman myself
what i am in worldly estate she is
what i become she must become
what i cannot be she cannot be
and shall i ever neglect her or hurt her or even forget to consider her
god forbid such a crime
they sat on over the teatable waiting for their luggage which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark
but evening began to close in and the luggage did not arrive and they had brought nothing more than they stood in
with the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed
out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection and whirled about unwillingly and tapped against the shutters
it soon began to rain
that cock knew the weather was going to change said clare
the woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night but she had placed candles upon the table and now they lit them
each candleflame drew towards the fireplace
these old houses are so draughty continued angel looking at the flames and at the grease guttering down the sides
i wonder where that luggage is
we haven't even a brush and comb
i don't know she answered absentminded
tess you are not a bit cheerful this eveningnot at all as you used to be
those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you
i am sorry i brought you here
i wonder if you really love me after all
he knew that she did and the words had no serious intent but she was surcharged with emotion and winced like a wounded animal
though she tried not to shed tears she could not help showing one or two
i did not mean it
said he sorry
you are worried at not having your things i know
i cannot think why old jonathan has not come with them
why it is seven o'clock
ah there he is
a knock had come to the door and there being nobody else to answer it clare went out
he returned to the room with a small package in his hand
it is not jonathan after all he said
how vexing
said tess
the packet had been brought by a special messenger who had arrived at talbothays from emminster vicarage immediately after the departure of the married couple and had followed them hither being under injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs
clare brought it to the light
it was less than a foot long sewed up in canvas sealed in red wax with his father's seal and directed in his father's hand to mrs angel clare
it is a little weddingpresent for you tess said he handing it to her
how thoughtful they are
tess looked a little flustered as she took it
i think i would rather have you open it dearest said she turning over the parcel
i don't like to break those great seals they look so serious
please open it for me
he undid the parcel
inside was a case of morocco leather on the top of which lay a note and a key
the note was for clare in the following words      my dear son     possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your    godmother mrs pitney when you were a lad shevain    kind woman that she wasleft to me a portion of the    contents of her jewelcase in trust for your wife if    you should ever have one as a mark of her affection    for you and whomsoever you should choose
this trust    i have fulfilled and the diamonds have been locked up    at my banker's ever since
though i feel it to be a    somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances i am as    you will see bound to hand over the articles to the    woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now    rightly belong and they are therefore promptly sent
they become i believe heirlooms strictly speaking    according to the terms of your godmother's will
the    precise words of the clause that refers to this matter    are enclosed
i do remember said clare but i had quite forgotten
unlocking the case they found it to contain a necklace with pendant bracelets and earrings and also some other small ornaments
tess seemed afraid to touch them at first but her eyes sparkled for a moment as much as the stones when clare spread out the set
are they mine
she asked incredulously
they are certainly said he
he looked into the fire
he remembered how when he was a lad of fifteen his godmother the squire's wifethe only rich person with whom he had ever come in contacthad pinned her faith to his success had prophesied a wondrous career for him
there had seemed nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants
they gleamed somewhat ironically now
yet why
he asked himself
it was but a question of vanity throughout and if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be admitted into the other
his wife was a d'urberville whom could they become better than her
suddenly he said with enthusiasm  tess put them onput them on
and he turned from the fire to help her
but as if by magic she had already donned themnecklace earrings bracelets and all
but the gown isn't right tess said clare
it ought to be a low one for a set of brilliants like that
ought it
said tess
yes said he
he suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice so as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear and when she had done this and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated amid the whiteness of her throat as it was designed to do he stepped back to survey her
my heavens said clare how beautiful you are
as everybody knows fine feathers make fine birds a peasant girl but very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a woman of fashion with the aids that art can render while the beauty of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside the fieldwoman's wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a dull day
he had never till now estimated the artistic excellence of tess's limbs and features
if you were only to appear in a ballroom
he said
but nono dearest i think i love you best in the wingbonnet and cottonfrockyes better than in this well as you support these dignities
tess's sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of excitement which was yet not happiness
i'll take them off she said in case jonathan should see me
they are not fit for me are they
they must be sold i suppose
let them stay a few minutes longer
sell them
never
it would be a breach of faith
influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed
she had something to tell and there might be help in these
she sat down with the jewels upon her and they again indulged in conjectures as to where jonathan could possibly be with their baggage
the ale they had poured out for his consumption when he came had gone flat with long standing
shortly after this they began supper which was already laid on a sidetable
ere they had finished there was a jerk in the firesmoke the rising skein of which bulged out into the room as if some giant had laid his hand on the chimneytop for a moment
it had been caused by the opening of the outer door
a heavy step was now heard in the passage and angel went out
i couldn' make nobody hear at all by knocking apologized jonathan kail for it was he at last and as't was raining out i opened the door
i've brought the things sir
i am very glad to see them
but you are very late
well yes sir
there was something subdued in jonathan kail's tone which had not been there in the day and lines of concern were ploughed upon his forehead in addition to the lines of years
he continued  we've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha' been a most terrible affliction since you and your mis'essso to name her nowleft us this a'ternoon
perhaps you ha'nt forgot the cock's afternoon crow
dear mewhat  well some says it do mane one thing and some another but what's happened is that poor little retty priddle hev tried to drown herself
no
really
why she bade us goodbye with the rest  yes
well sir when you and your mis'essso to name what she lawful iswhen you two drove away as i say retty and marian put on their bonnets and went out and as there is not much doing now being new year's eve and folks mops and brooms from what's inside 'em nobody took much notice
they went on to leweverard where they had summut to drink and then on they vamped to dreearmed cross and there they seemed to have parted retty striking across the watermeads as if for home and marian going on to the next village where there's another publichouse
nothing more was zeed or heard o' retty till the waterman on his way home noticed something by the great pool 'twas her bonnet and shawl packed up
in the water he found her
he and another man brought her home thinking a' was dead but she fetched round by degrees
angel suddenly recollecting that tess was overhearing this gloomy tale went to shut the door between the passage and the anteroom to the inner parlour where she was but his wife flinging a shawl round her had come to the outer room and was listening to the man's narrative her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of rain glistening upon it
and more than this there's marian she's been found dead drunk by the withybeda girl who hev never been known to touch anything before except shilling ale though to be sure 'a was always a good trencherwoman as her face showed
it seems as if the maids had all gone out o' their minds
and izz
asked tess
izz is about house as usual but 'a do say 'a can guess how it happened and she seems to be very low in mind about it poor maid as well she mid be
and so you see sir as all this happened just when we was packing your few traps and your mis'ess's nightrail and dressing things into the cart why it belated me
yes
well jonathan will you get the trunks upstairs and drink a cup of ale and hasten back as soon as you can in case you should be wanted
tess had gone back to the inner parlour and sat down by the fire looking wistfully into it
she heard jonathan kail's heavy footsteps up and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage and heard him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him and for the gratuity he received
jonathan's footsteps then died from the door and his cart creaked away
angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door and coming in to where she sat over the hearth pressed her cheeks between his hands from behind
he expected her to jump up gaily and unpack the toiletgear that she had been so anxious about but as she did not rise he sat down with her in the firelight the candles on the suppertable being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its glow
i am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls he said
still don't let it depress you
retty was naturally morbid you know
without the least cause said tess
while they who have cause to be hide it and pretend they are not
this incident had turned the scale for her
they were simple and innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen they had deserved better at the hands of fate
she had deserved worseyet she was the chosen one
it was wicked of her to take all without paying
she would pay to the uttermost farthing she would tell there and then
this final determination she came to when she looked into the fire he holding her hand
a steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides and back of the fireplace with its colour and the wellpolished andirons and the old brass tongs that would not meet
the underside of the mantelshelf was flushed with the highcoloured light and the legs of the table nearest the fire
tess's face and neck reflected the same warmth which each gem turned into an aldebaran or a siriusa constellation of white red and green flashes that interchanged their hues with her every pulsation
do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults
he asked abruptly finding that she still remained immovable
we spoke lightly perhaps and you may well have done so
but for me it was no light promise
i want to make a confession to you love
this from him so unexpectedly apposite had the effect upon her of a providential interposition
you have to confess something
she said quickly and even with gladness and relief
you did not expect it
ahyou thought too highly of me
now listen
put your head there because i want you to forgive me and not to be indignant with me for not telling you before as perhaps i ought to have done
how strange it was
he seemed to be her double
she did not speak and clare went on  i did not mention it because i was afraid of endangering my chance of you darling the great prize of my lifemy fellowship i call you
my brother's fellowship was won at his college mine at talbothays dairy
well i would not risk it
i was going to tell you a month agoat the time you agreed to be mine but i could not i thought it might frighten you away from me
i put it off then i thought i would tell you yesterday to give you a chance at least of escaping me
but i did not
and i did not this morning when you proposed our confessing our faults on the landingthe sinner that i was
but i must now i see you sitting there so solemnly
i wonder if you will forgive me
o yes
i am sure that  well i hope so
but wait a minute
you don't know
to begin at the beginning
though i imagine my poor father fears that i am one of the eternally lost for my doctrines i am of course a believer in good morals tess as much as you
i used to wish to be a teacher of men and it was a great disappointment to me when i found i could not enter the church
i admired spotlessness even though i could lay no claim to it and hated impurity as i hope i do now
whatever one may think of plenary inspiration one must heartily subscribe to these words of paul 'be thou an examplein word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity'
it is the only safeguard for us poor human beings
'integer vitae' says a roman poet who is strange company for st paul     the man of upright life from frailties free    stands not in need of moorish spear or bow
well a certain place is paved with good intentions and having felt all that so strongly you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in me when in the midst of my fine aims for other people i myself fell
he then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been made when tossed about by doubts and difficulties in london like a cork on the waves he plunged into eightandforty hours' dissipation with a stranger
happily i awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly he continued
i would have no more to say to her and i came home
i have never repeated the offence
but i felt i should like to treat you with perfect frankness and honour and i could not do so without telling this
do you forgive me
she pressed his hand tightly for an answer
then we will dismiss it at once and for evertoo painful as it is for the occasionand talk of something lighter
o angeli am almost gladbecause now you can forgive me
i have not made my confession
i have a confession tooremember i said so
ah to be sure
now then for it wicked little one
perhaps although you smile it is as serious as yours or more so
it can hardly be more serious dearest
it cannoto no it cannot
she jumped up joyfully at the hope
no it cannot be more serious certainly she cried because 'tis just the same
i will tell you now
she sat down again
their hands were still joined
the ashes under the grate were lit by the fire vertically like a torrid waste
imagination might have beheld a last day luridness in this redcoaled glow which fell on his face and hand and on hers peering into the loose hair about her brow and firing the delicate skin underneath
a large shadow of her shape rose upon the wall and ceiling
she bent forward at which each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's and pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with alec d'urberville and its results murmuring the words without flinching and with her eyelids drooping down
end of phase the fourth      phase the fifth the woman pays    xxxv   her narrative ended even its reassertions and secondary explanations were done
tess's voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind and she had not wept
but the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed
the fire in the grate looked impishdemoniacally funny as if it did not care in the least about her strait
the fender grinned idly as if it too did not care
the light from the waterbottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem
all material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration
and yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her or rather nothing in the substance of things
but the essence of things had changed
when she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness
clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him
after stirring the embers he rose to his feet all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now
his face had withered
in the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor
he could not by any contrivance think closely enough that was the meaning of his vague movement
when he spoke it was in the most inadequate commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him
tess
yes dearest
am i to believe this
from your manner i am to take it as true
o you cannot be out of your mind
you ought to be
yet you are not  my wife my tessnothing in you warrants such a supposition as that
i am not out of my mind she said
and yet  he looked vacantly at her to resume with dazed senses why didn't you tell me before
ah yes you would have told me in a waybut i hindered you i remember
these and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed
he turned away and bent over a chair
tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep
presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot and from this position she crouched in a heap
in the name of our love forgive me
she whispered with a dry mouth
i have forgiven you for the same
and as he did not answer she said again  forgive me as you are forgiven
i forgive you angel
youyes you do
but you do not forgive me
o tess forgiveness does not apply to the case
you were one person now you are another
my godhow can forgiveness meet such a grotesqueprestidigitation as that
he paused contemplating this definition then suddenly broke into horrible laughteras unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell
don'tdon't
it kills me quite that
she shrieked
o have mercy upon mehave mercy
he did not answer and sickly white she jumped up
angel angel
what do you mean by that laugh
she cried out
do you know what this is to me
he shook his head
i have been hoping longing praying to make you happy
i have thought what joy it will be to do it what an unworthy wife i shall be if i do not
that's what i have felt angel
i know that
i thought angel that you loved meme my very self
if it is i you do love o how can it be that you look and speak so
it frightens me
having begun to love you i love you for everin all changes in all disgraces because you are yourself
i ask no more
then how can you o my own husband stop loving me
i repeat the woman i have been loving is not you
but who
another woman in your shape
she perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times
he looked upon her as a species of imposter a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one
terror was upon her white face as she saw it her cheek was flaccid and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole
the horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered and he stepped forward thinking she was going to fall
sit down sit down he said gently
you are ill and it is natural that you should be
she did sit down without knowing where she was that strained look still upon her face and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep
i don't belong to you any more then do i angel
she asked helplessly
it is not me but another woman like me that he loved he says
the image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was illused
her eyes filled as she regarded her position further she turned round and burst into a flood of selfsympathetic tears
clare was relieved at this change for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself
he waited patiently apathetically till the violence of her grief had worn itself out and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals
angel she said suddenly in her natural tones the insane dry voice of terror having left her now
angel am i too wicked for you and me to live together
i have not been able to think what we can do
i shan't ask you to let me live with you angel because i have no right to
i shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married as i said i would do and i shan't finish the goodhussif' i cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings
shan't you
no i shan't do anything unless you order me to and if you go away from me i shall not follow 'ee and if you never speak to me any more i shall not ask why unless you tell me i may
and if i order you to do anything
i will obey you like your wretched slave even if it is to lie down and die
you are very good
but it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of selfsacrifice and your past mood of selfpreservation
these were the first words of antagonism
to fling elaborate sarcasms at tess however was much like flinging them at a dog or cat
the charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled
she remained mute not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her
she hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled like the object lens of a microscope
meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life in his universe returned to him and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood
some consequent action was necessary yet what
tess he said as gently as he could speak i cannot stayin this roomjust now
i will walk out a little way
he quietly left the room and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supperone for her one for himremained on the table untasted
this was what their agape had come to
at tea two or three hours earlier they had in the freakishness of affection drunk from one cup
the closing of the door behind him gently as it had been pulled to roused tess from her stupor
he was gone she could not stay
hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed putting out the candles as if she were never coming back
the rain was over and the night was now clear
she was soon close at his heels for clare walked slowly and without purpose
his form beside her light gray figure looked black sinister and forbidding and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud
clare turned at hearing her footsteps but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference to him and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house
the cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water the rain having been enough to charge them but not enough to wash them away
across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them therethe vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean
the place to which they had travelled today was in the same valley as talbothays but some miles lower down the river and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him
away from the house the road wound through the meads and along these she followed clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him but with dumb and vacant fidelity
at last however her listless walk brought her up alongside him and still he said nothing
the cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment and it was mighty in clare now
the outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse she knew that he saw her without irradiationin all her bareness that time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then      behold when thy face is made bare he that loved thee       shall hate    thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate
for thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain    and the veil of thine head shall be grief and the crown       shall be pain
he was still intently thinking and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought
what a weak thing her presence must have become to him
she could not help addressing clare
what have i donewhat have i done
i have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you
you don't think i planned it do you
it is in your own mind what you are angry at angel it is not in me
o it is not in me and i am not that deceitful woman you think me
h'mwell
not deceitful my wife but not the same
no not the same
but do not make me reproach you
i have sworn that i will not and i will do everything to avoid it
but she went on pleading in her distraction and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence
angelangel
i was a childa child when it happened
i knew nothing of men
you were more sinned against than sinning that i admit
then will you not forgive me
i do forgive you but forgiveness is not all
and love me
to this question he did not answer
o angelmy mother says that it sometimes happens soshe knows several cases where they were worse than i and the husband has not minded it muchhas got over it at least
and yet the woman had not loved him as i do you
don't tess don't argue
different societies different manners
you almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things
you don't know what you say
i am only a peasant by position not by nature
she spoke with an impulse to anger but it went as it came
so much the worse for you
i think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue
i cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other factof your want of firmness
decrepit families imply decrepit wills decrepit conduct
heaven why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent
here was i thinking you a newsprung child of nature there were you the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy
lots of families are as bad as mine in that
retty's family were once large landowners and so were dairyman billett's
and the debbyhouses who now are carters were once the de bayeux family
you find such as i everywhere 'tis a feature of our county and i can't help it
so much the worse for the county
she took these reproaches in their bulk simply not in their particulars he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto and to all else she was indifferent
they wandered on again in silence
it was said afterwards that a cottager of wellbridge who went out late that night for a doctor met two lovers in the pastures walking very slowly without converse one behind the other as in a funeral procession and the glimpse that he obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they were anxious and sad
returning later he passed them again in the same field progressing just as slowly and as regardless of the hour and of the cheerless night as before
it was only on account of his preoccupation with his own affairs and the illness in his house that he did not bear in mind the curious incident which however he recalled a long while after
during the interval of the cottager's going and coming she had said to her husband  i don't see how i can help being the cause of much misery to you all your life
the river is down there
i can put an end to myself in it
i am not afraid
i don't wish to add murder to my other follies he said
i will leave something to show that i did it myselfon account of my shame
they will not blame you then
don't speak so absurdlyi wish not to hear it
it is nonsense to have such thoughts in this kind of case which is rather one for satirical laughter than for tragedy
you don't in the least understand the quality of the mishap
it would be viewed in the light of a joke by ninetenths of the world if it were known
please oblige me by returning to the house and going to bed
i will said she dutifully
they had rambled round by a road which led to the wellknown ruins of the cistercian abbey behind the mill the latter having in centuries past been attached to the monastic establishment
the mill still worked on food being a perennial necessity the abbey had perished creeds being transient
one continually sees the ministration of the temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal
their walk having been circuitous they were still not far from the house and in obeying his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the main river and follow the road for a few yards
when she got back everything remained as she had left it the fire being still burning
she did not stay downstairs for more than a minute but proceeded to her chamber whither the luggage had been taken
here she sat down on the edge of the bed looking blankly around and presently began to undress
in removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity something was hanging beneath it and she lifted the candle to see what it was
a bough of mistletoe
angel had put it there she knew that in an instant
this was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and bring whose contents he would not explain to her saying that time would soon show her the purpose thereof
in his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there
how foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now
having nothing more to fear having scarce anything to hope for that he would relent there seemed no promise whatever she lay down dully
when sorrow ceases to be speculative sleep sees her opportunity
among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which welcomed it and in a few minutes the lonely tess forgot existence surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once possibly been the bridechamber of her own ancestry
later on that night clare also retraced his steps to the house
entering softly to the sittingroom he obtained a light and with the manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon the old horsehair sofa which stood there and roughly shaped it to a sleepingcouch
before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs and listened at the door of her apartment
her measured breathing told that she was sleeping profoundly
thank god
murmured clare and yet he was conscious of a pang of bitterness at the thoughtapproximately true though not wholly sothat having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders she was now reposing without care
he turned away to descend then irresolute faced round to her door again
in the act he caught sight of one of the d'urberville dames whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to tess's bedchamber
in the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant
sinister design lurked in the woman's features a concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sexso it seemed to him then
the caroline bodice of the portrait was lowprecisely as tess's had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace and again he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between them
the check was sufficient
he resumed his retreat and descended
his air remained calm and cold his small compressed mouth indexing his powers of selfcontrol his face wearing still that terrible sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure
it was the face of a man who was no longer passion's slave yet who found no advantage in his enfranchisement
he was simply regarding the harrowing contingencies of human experience the unexpectedness of things
nothing so pure so sweet so virginal as tess had seemed possible all the long while that he had adored her up to an hour ago but          the little less and what worlds away
he argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not indexed in the honest freshness of her face but tess had no advocate to set him right
could it be possible he continued that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one discordant and contrasting
he reclined on his couch in the sittingroom and extinguished the light
the night came in and took up its place there unconcerned and indifferent the night which had already swallowed up his happiness and was now digesting it listlessly and was ready to swallow up the happiness of a thousand other people with as little disturbance or change of mien
xxxvi   clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive as though associated with crime
the fireplace confronted him with its extinct embers the spread suppertable whereon stood the two full glasses of untasted wine now flat and filmy her vacated seat and his own the other articles of furniture with their eternal look of not being able to help it their intolerable inquiry what was to be done
from above there was no sound but in a few minutes there came a knock at the door
he remembered that it would be the neighbouring cottager's wife who was to minister to their wants while they remained here
the presence of a third person in the house would be extremely awkward just now and being already dressed he opened the window and informed her that they could manage to shift for themselves that morning
she had a milkcan in her hand which he told her to leave at the door
when the dame had gone away he searched in the back quarters of the house for fuel and speedily lit a fire
there was plenty of eggs butter bread and so on in the larder and clare soon had breakfast laid his experiences at the dairy having rendered him facile in domestic preparations
the smoke of the kindled wood rose from the chimney without like a lotusheaded column local people who were passing by saw it and thought of the newlymarried couple and envied their happiness
angel cast a final glance round and then going to the foot of the stairs called in a conventional voice  breakfast is ready
he opened the front door and took a few steps in the morning air
when after a short space he came back she was already in the sittingroom mechanically readjusting the breakfast things
as she was fully attired and the interval since his calling her had been but two or three minutes she must have been dressed or nearly so before he went to summon her
her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at the back of her head and she had put on one of the new frocksa pale blue woollen garment with neckfrillings of white
her hands and face appeared to be cold and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire
the marked civility of clare's tone in calling her seemed to have inspired her for the moment with a new glimmer of hope
but it soon died when she looked at him
the pair were in truth but the ashes of their former fires
to the hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness it seemed as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any more
he spoke gently to her and she replied with a like undemonstrativeness
at last she came up to him looking in his sharplydefined face as one who had no consciousness that her own formed a visible object also
angel
she said and paused touching him with her fingers lightly as a breeze as though she could hardly believe to be there in the flesh the man who was once her lover
her eyes were bright her pale cheek still showed its wonted roundness though halfdried tears had left glistening traces thereon and the usually ripe red mouth was almost as pale as her cheek
throbbingly alive as she was still under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further pull upon it would cause real illness dull her characteristic eyes and make her mouth thin
she looked absolutely pure
nature in her fantastic trickery had set such a seal of maidenhood upon tess's countenance that he gazed at her with a stupefied air
tess
say it is not true
no it is not true
it is true
every word
every word
he looked at her imploringly as if he would willingly have taken a lie from her lips knowing it to be one and have made of it by some sort of sophistry a valid denial
however she only repeated  it is true
is he living
angel then asked
the baby died
but the man
he is alive
a last despair passed over clare's face
is he in england
yes
he took a few vague steps
my positionis this he said abruptly
i thoughtany man would have thoughtthat by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social standing with fortune with knowledge of the world i should secure rustic innocence as surely as i should secure pink cheeks buthowever i am no man to reproach you and i will not
tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been needed
therein lay just the distress of it she saw that he had lost all round
angeli should not have let it go on to marriage with you if i had not known that after all there was a last way out of it for you though i hoped you would never  her voice grew husky
a last way
i mean to get rid of me
you can get rid of me
how
by divorcing me
good heavenshow can you be so simple
how can i divorce you
can't younow i have told you
i thought my confession would give you grounds for that
o tessyou are too toochildishunformedcrude i suppose
i don't know what you are
you don't understand the lawyou don't understand
whatyou cannot
indeed i cannot
a quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listener's face
i thoughti thought she whispered
o now i see how wicked i seem to you
believe mebelieve me on my soul i never thought but that you could
i hoped you would not yet i believed without a doubt that you could cast me off if you were determined and didn't love me atatall
you were mistaken he said
o then i ought to have done it to have done it last night
but i hadn't the courage
that's just like me
the courage to do what
as she did not answer he took her by the hand
what were you thinking of doing
he inquired
of putting an end to myself
when
she writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his
last night she answered
where
under your mistletoe
my good
how
he asked sternly
i'll tell you if you won't be angry with me
she said shrinking
it was with the cord of my box
but i could notdo the last thing
i was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name
the unexpected quality of this confession wrung from her and not volunteered shook him perceptibly
but he still held her and letting his glance fall from her face downwards he said  now listen to this
you must not dare to think of such a horrible thing
how could you
you will promise me as your husband to attempt that no more
i am ready to promise
i saw how wicked it was
wicked
the idea was unworthy of you beyond description
but angel she pleaded enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon him it was thought of entirely on your accountto set you free without the scandal of the divorce that i thought you would have to get
i should never have dreamt of doing it on mine
however to do it with my own hand is too good for me after all
it is you my ruined husband who ought to strike the blow
i think i should love you more if that were possible if you could bring yourself to do it since there's no other way of escape for 'ee
i feel i am so utterly worthless
so very greatly in the way
ssh
well since you say no i won't
i have no wish opposed to yours
he knew this to be true enough
since the desperation of the night her activities had dropped to zero and there was no further rashness to be feared
tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfasttable with more or less success and they sat down both on the same side so that their glances did not meet
there was at first something awkward in hearing each other eat and drink but this could not be escaped moreover the amount of eating done was small on both sides
breakfast over he rose and telling her the hour at which he might be expected to dinner went off to the miller's in a mechanical pursuance of the plan of studying that business which had been his only practical reason for coming here
when he was gone tess stood at the window and presently saw his form crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises
he sank behind it crossed the railway beyond and disappeared
then without a sigh she turned her attention to the room and began clearing the table and setting it in order
the charwoman soon came
her presence was at first a strain upon tess but afterwards an alleviation
at halfpast twelve she left her assistant alone in the kitchen and returning to the sittingroom waited for the reappearance of angel's form behind the bridge
about one he showed himself
her face flushed although he was a quarter of a mile off
she ran to the kitchen to get the dinner served by the time he should enter
he went first to the room where they had washed their hands together the day before and as he entered the sittingroom the dishcovers rose from the dishes as if by his own motion
how punctual
he said
yes
i saw you coming over the bridge said she
the meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing during the morning at the abbey mill of the methods of bolting and the oldfashioned machinery which he feared would not enlighten him greatly on modern improved methods some of it seeming to have been in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining conventual buildingsnow a heap of ruins
he left the house again in the course of an hour coming home at dusk and occupying himself through the evening with his papers
she feared she was in the way and when the old woman was gone retired to the kitchen where she made herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour
clare's shape appeared at the door
you must not work like this he said
you are not my servant you are my wife
she raised her eyes and brightened somewhat
i may think myself thatindeed
she murmured in piteous raillery
you mean in name
well i don't want to be anything more
you may think so tess
you are
what do you mean
i don't know she said hastily with tears in her accents
i thought ibecause i am not respectable i mean
i told you i thought i was not respectable enough long agoand on that account i didn't want to marry you onlyonly you urged me
she broke into sobs and turned her back to him
it would almost have won round any man but angel clare
within the remote depths of his constitution so gentle and affectionate as he was in general there lay hidden a hard logical deposit like a vein of metal in a soft loam which turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it
it had blocked his acceptance of the church it blocked his acceptance of tess
moreover his affection itself was less fire than radiance and with regard to the other sex when he ceased to believe he ceased to follow contrasting in this with many impressionable natures who remain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise
he waited till her sobbing ceased
i wish half the women in england were as respectable as you he said in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general
it isn't a question of respectability but one of principle
he spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by appearances
there was it is true underneath a back current of sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him
but tess did not think of this she took everything as her deserts and hardly opened her mouth
the firmness of her devotion to him was indeed almost pitiful quicktempered as she naturally was nothing that he could say made her unseemly she sought not her own was not provoked thought no evil of his treatment of her
she might just now have been apostolic charity herself returned to a selfseeking modern world
this evening night and morning were passed precisely as the preceding ones had been passed
on one and only one occasion did shethe formerly free and independent tessventure to make any advances
it was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal to go out to the flourmill
as he was leaving the table he said goodbye and she replied in the same words at the same time inclining her mouth in the way of his
he did not avail himself of the invitation saying as he turned hastily aside  i shall be home punctually
tess shrank into herself as if she had been struck
often enough had he tried to reach those lips against her consentoften had he said gaily that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and milk and honey on which she mainly lived that he drew sustenance from them and other follies of that sort
but he did not care for them now
he observed her sudden shrinking and said gently  you know i have to think of a course
it was imperative that we should stay together a little while to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting
but you must see it is only for form's sake
yes said tess absently
he went out and on his way to the mill stood still and wished for a moment that he had responded yet more kindly and kissed her once at least
thus they lived through this despairing day or two in the same house truly but more widely apart than before they were lovers
it was evident to her that he was as he had said living with paralyzed activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure
she was awestricken to discover such determination under such apparent flexibility
his consistency was indeed too cruel
she no longer expected forgiveness now
more than once she thought of going away from him during his absence at the mill but she feared that this instead of benefiting him might be the means of hampering and humiliating him yet more if it should become known
meanwhile clare was meditating verily
his thought had been unsuspended he was becoming ill with thinking eaten out with thinking withered by thinking scourged out of all his former pulsating flexuous domesticity
he walked about saying to himself what's to be donewhat's to be done
and by chance she overheard him
it caused her to break the reserve about their future which had hitherto prevailed
i supposeyou are not going to live with melong are you angel
she asked the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely mechanical were the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm upon her face
i cannot he said without despising myself and what is worse perhaps despising you
i mean of course cannot live with you in the ordinary sense
at present whatever i feel i do not despise you
and let me speak plainly or you may not see all my difficulties
how can we live together while that man liveshe being your husband in nature and not i
if he were dead it might be different
besides that's not all the difficulty it lies in another considerationone bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves
think of years to come and children being born to us and this past matter getting knownfor it must get known
there is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere
well think of wretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding years
what an awakening for them
what a prospect
can you honestly say 'remain' after contemplating this contingency
don't you think we had better endure the ills we have than fly to others
her eyelids weighted with trouble continued drooping as before
i cannot say 'remain' she answered i cannot i had not thought so far
tess's feminine hopeshall we confess ithad been so obstinately recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against his judgement
though unsophisticated in the usual sense she was not incomplete and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she had not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity
nothing else would serve her she knew if this failed
it was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy she said to herself yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish
his last representation had now been made and it was as she said a new view
she had truly never thought so far as that and his lucid picture of possible offspring who would scorn her was one that brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian to its centre
sheer experience had already taught her that in some circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever
like all who have been previsioned by suffering she could in the words of m sullyprudhomme hear a penal sentence in the fiat you shall be born particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers
yet such is the vulpine slyness of dame nature that till now tess had been hoodwinked by her love for clare into forgetting it might result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had bewailed as misfortune to herself
she therefore could not withstand his argument
but with the selfcombating proclivity of the supersensitive an answer thereto arose in clare's own mind and he almost feared it
it was based on her exceptional physical nature and she might have used it promisingly
she might have added besides on an australian upland or texan plain who is to know or care about my misfortunes or to reproach me or you
yet like the majority of women she accepted the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable
and she may have been right
the intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only its own bitterness but its husband's and even if these assumed reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by strangers they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious brain
it was the third day of the estrangement
some might risk the odd paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man
we do not say it
yet clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a fault imaginative to impracticability
with these natures corporal presence is something less appealing than corporal absence the latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects of the real
she found that her personality did not plead her cause so forcibly as she had anticipated
the figurative phrase was true she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire
i have thought over what you say she remarked to him moving her forefinger over the tablecloth her other hand which bore the ring that mocked them both supporting her forehead
it is quite true all of it it must be
you must go away from me
but what can you do
i can go home
clare had not thought of that
are you sure
he inquired
quite sure
we ought to part and we may as well get it past and done
you once said that i was apt to win men against their better judgement and if i am constantly before your eyes i may cause you to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish and afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible
and you would like to go home
he asked
i want to leave you and go home
then it shall be so
though she did not look up at him she started
there was a difference between the proposition and the covenant which she had felt only too quickly
i feared it would come to this she murmured her countenance meekly fixed
i don't complain angel ii think it best
what you said has quite convinced me
yes though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together yet somewhen years hence you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter and knowing what you do of my bygones you yourself might be tempted to say words and they might be overheard perhaps by my own children
o what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then
i will gotomorrow
and i shall not stay here
though i didn't like to initiate it i have seen that it was advisable we should partat least for a while till i can better see the shape that things have taken and can write to you
tess stole a glance at her husband
he was pale even tremulous but as before she was appalled by the determination revealed in the depths of this gentle being she had marriedthe will to subdue the grosser to the subtler emotion the substance to the conception the flesh to the spirit
propensities tendencies habits were as dead leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency
he may have observed her look for he explained  i think of people more kindly when i am away from them adding cynically god knows perhaps we will shake down together some day for weariness thousands have done it
that day he began to pack up and she went upstairs and began to pack also
both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part the next morning for ever despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom any parting which has an air of finality is a torture
he knew and she knew that though the fascination which each had exercised over the otheron her part independently of accomplishmentswould probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent than ever time must attenuate that effect the practical arguments against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view
moreover when two people are once partedhave abandoned a common domicile and a common environmentnew growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place unforeseen accidents hinder intentions and old plans are forgotten
xxxvii   midnight came and passed silently for there was nothing to announce it in the valley of the froom
not long after one o'clock there was a slight creak in the darkened farmhouse once the mansion of the d'urbervilles
tess who used the upper chamber heard it and awoke
it had come from the corner step of the staircase which as usual was loosely nailed
she saw the door of her bedroom open and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread
he was in his shirt and trousers only and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy
when he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of indescribable sadness  dead
dead
dead
under the influence of any stronglydisturbing force clare would occasionally walk in his sleep and even perform strange feats such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage when he reenacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her
tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now
her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart that awake or asleep he inspired her with no sort of personal fear
if he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her trust in his protectiveness
clare came close and bent over her
dead dead dead
he murmured
after fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe he bent lower enclosed her in his arms and rolled her in the sheet as in a shroud
then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body he carried her across the room murmuring  my poor poor tessmy dearest darling tess
so sweet so good so true
the words of endearment withheld so severely in his waking hours were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart
if it had been to save her weary life she would not by moving or struggling have put an end to the position she found herself in
thus she lay in absolute stillness scarcely venturing to breathe and wondering what he was going to do with her suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing
my wifedead dead
he said
he paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister
was he going to throw her down
selfsolicitude was near extinction in her and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow possibly for always she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror
if they could only fall together and both be dashed to pieces how fit how desirable
however he did not let her fall but took advantage of the support of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lipslips in the daytime scorned
then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold and descended the staircase
the creak of the loose stair did not awaken him and they reached the groundfloor safely
freeing one of his hands from his grasp of her for a moment he slid back the doorbar and passed out slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge of the door
but this he seemed not to mind and having room for extension in the open air he lifted her against his shoulder so that he could carry her with ease the absence of clothes taking much from his burden
thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the river a few yards distant
his ultimate intention if he had any she had not yet divined and she found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have done
so easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him that it pleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute possession to dispose of as he should choose
it was consoling under the hovering terror of tomorrow's separation to feel that he really recognized her now as his wife tess and did not cast her off even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself the right of harming her
ah
now she knew what he was dreaming ofthat sunday morning when he had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids who had loved him nearly as much as she if that were possible which tess could hardly admit
clare did not cross the bridge with her but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill at length stood still on the brink of the river
its waters in creeping down these miles of meadowland frequently divided serpentining in purposeless curves looping themselves around little islands that had no name returning and reembodying themselves as a broad main stream further on
opposite the spot to which he had brought her was such a general confluence and the river was proportionately voluminous and deep
across it was a narrow footbridge but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away leaving the bare plank only which lying a few inches above the speeding current formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads and tess had noticed from the window of the house in the daytime young men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing
her husband had possibly observed the same performance anyhow he now mounted the plank and sliding one foot forward advanced along it
was he going to drown her
probably he was
the spot was lonely the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of accomplishment
he might drown her if he would it would be better than parting tomorrow to lead severed lives
the swift stream raced and gyrated under them tossing distorting and splitting the moon's reflected face
spots of froth travelled past and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles
if they could both fall together into the current now their arms would be so tightly clasped together that they could not be saved they would go out of the world almost painlessly and there would be no more reproach to her or to him for marrying her
his last halfhour with her would have been a loving one while if they lived till he awoke his daytime aversion would return and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a transient dream
the impulse stirred in her yet she dared not indulge it to make a movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf
how she valued her own life had been proved but hisshe had no right to tamper with it
he reached the other side with her in safety
here they were within a plantation which formed the abbey grounds and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached the ruined choir of the abbeychurch
against the north wall was the empty stone coffin of an abbot in which every tourist with a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself
in this clare carefully laid tess
having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply as if a greatly desired end were attained
clare then lay down on the ground alongside when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber of exhaustion and remained motionless as a log
the spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort was now over
tess sat up in the coffin
the night though dry and mild for the season was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him to remain here long in his halfclothed state
if he were left to himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning and be chilled to certain death
she had heard of such deaths after sleepwalking
but how could she dare to awaken him and let him know what he had been doing when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of her
tess however stepping out of her stone confine shook him slightly but was unable to arouse him without being violent
it was indispensable to do something for she was beginning to shiver the sheet being but a poor protection
her excitement had in a measure kept her warm during the few minutes' adventure but that beatific interval was over
it suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion and accordingly she whispered in his ear with as much firmness and decision as she could summon  let us walk on darling at the same time taking him suggestively by the arm
to her relief he unresistingly acquiesced her words had apparently thrown him back into his dream which thenceforward seemed to enter on a new phase wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit and was leading him to heaven
thus she conducted him by the arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence crossing which they stood at the manorhouse door
tess's feet were quite bare and the stones hurt her and chilled her to the bone but clare was in his woollen stockings and appeared to feel no discomfort
there was no further difficulty
she induced him to lie down on his own sofa bed and covered him up warmly lighting a temporary fire of wood to dry any dampness out of him
the noise of these attentions she thought might awaken him and secretly wished that they might
but the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained undisturbed
as soon as they met the next morning tess divined that angel knew little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night's excursion though as regarded himself he may have been aware that he had not lain still
in truth he had awakened that morning from a sleep deep as annihilation and during those first few moments in which the brain like a samson shaking himself is trying its strength he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding
but the realities of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject
he waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing he knew that if any intention of his concluded overnight did not vanish in the light of morning it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure reason even if initiated by impulse of feeling that it was so far therefore to be trusted
he thus beheld in the pale morning light the resolve to separate from her not as a hot and indignant instinct but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch and burn standing in its bones nothing but a skeleton but none the less there
clare no longer hesitated
at breakfast and while they were packing the few remaining articles he showed his weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened but the reflection that it would anger him grieve him stultify him to know that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his commonsense did not approve that his inclination had compromised his dignity when reason slept again deterred her
it was too much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication
it just crossed her mind too that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go
he had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town and soon after breakfast it arrived
she saw in it the beginning of the endthe temporary end at least for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him
the luggage was put on the top and the man drove them off the miller and the old waitingwoman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure which clare attributed to his discovery that the millwork was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate a statement that was true so far as it went
beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a fiasco or that they were not going together to visit friends
their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back and as clare wished to wind up his business with mr crick tess could hardly avoid paying mrs crick a call at the same time unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state
to make the call as unobtrusive as possible they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairyhouse and descended the track on foot side by side
the withybed had been cut and they could see over the stumps the spot to which clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp and far away behind the cowstalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace
the gold of the summer picture was now gray the colours mean the rich soil mud and the river cold
over the bartongate the dairyman saw them and came forward throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in talbothays and its vicinity on the reappearance of the newlymarried
then mrs crick emerged from the house and several others of their old acquaintance though marian and retty did not seem to be there
tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours which affected her far otherwise than they supposed
in the tacit agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as would have been ordinary
and then although she would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject tess had to hear in detail the story of marian and retty
the later had gone home to her father's and marian had left to look for employment elsewhere
they feared she would come to no good
to dissipate the sadness of this recital tess went and bade all her favourite cows goodbye touching each of them with her hand and as she and clare stood side by side at leaving as if united body and soul there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one who should have seen it truly two limbs of one life as they outwardly were his arm touching hers her skirts touching him facing one way as against all the dairy facing the other speaking in their adieux as we and yet sundered like the poles
perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed in their attitude some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity different from the natural shyness of young couples may have been apparent for when they were gone mrs crick said to her husband  how onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem and how they stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream
didn't it strike 'ee that 'twas so
tess had always sommat strange in her and she's not now quite like the proud young bride of a wellbedoing man
they reentered the vehicle and were driven along the roads towards weatherbury and stagfoot lane till they reached the lane inn where clare dismissed the fly and man
they rested here a while and entering the vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did not know their relations
at a midway point when nuttlebury had been passed and where there were crossroads clare stopped the conveyance and said to tess that if she meant to return to her mother's house it was here that he would leave her
as they could not talk with freedom in the driver's presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads she assented and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away
now let us understand each other he said gently
there is no anger between us though there is that which i cannot endure at present
i will try to bring myself to endure it
i will let you know where i go to as soon as i know myself
and if i can bring myself to bear itif it is desirable possiblei will come to you
but until i come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me
the severity of the decree seemed deadly to tess she saw his view of her clearly enough he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him
yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this
but she could contest the point with him no further
she simply repeated after him his own words
until you come to me i must not try to come to you
just so
may i write to you
o yesif you are ill or want anything at all
i hope that will not be the case so that it may happen that i write first to you
i agree to the conditions angel because you know best what my punishment ought to be onlyonlydon't make it more than i can bear
that was all she said on the matter
if tess had been artful had she made a scene fainted wept hysterically in that lonely lane notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed he would probably not have withstood her
but her mood of longsuffering made his way easy for him and she herself was his best advocate
pride too entered into her submissionwhich perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the whole d'urberville familyand the many effective chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched
the remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only
he now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money which he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose
the brilliants the interest in which seemed to be tess's for her life only if he understood the wording of the will he advised her to let him send to a bank for safety and to this she readily agreed
these things arranged he walked with tess back to the carriage and handed her in
the coachman was paid and told where to drive her
taking next his own bag and umbrellathe sole articles he had brought with him hitherwardshe bade her goodbye and they parted there and then
the fly moved creepingly up a hill and clare watched it go with an unpremeditated hope that tess would look out of the window for one moment
but that she never thought of doing would not have ventured to do lying in a halfdead faint inside
thus he beheld her recede and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet with peculiar emendations of his own       god's not in his heaven     all's wrong with the world
when tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way and hardly knew that he loved her still
xxxviii   as she drove on through blackmoor vale and the landscape of her youth began to open around her tess aroused herself from her stupor
her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents
she reached a turnpikegate which stood upon the highway to the village
it was thrown open by a stranger not by the old man who had kept it for many years and to whom she had been known he had probably left on new year's day the date when such changes were made
having received no intelligence lately from her home she asked the turnpikekeeper for news
ohnothing miss he answered
marlott is marlott still
folks have died and that
john durbeyfield too hev had a daughter married this week to a gentlemanfarmer not from john's own house you know they was married elsewhere the gentleman being of that high standing that john's own folk was not considered wellbedoing enough to have any part in it the bridegroom seeming not to know how't have been discovered that john is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day but done out of his property in the time o' the romans
however sir john as we call 'n now kept up the weddingday as well as he could and stood treat to everybody in the parish and john's wife sung songs at the pure drop till past eleven o'clock
hearing this tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings
she asked the turnpikekeeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while and on his offering no objection she dismissed her carriage and went on to the village alone by a back lane
at sight of her father's chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house
inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a weddingtour with a comparatively rich man who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity while here she was friendless creeping up to the old door quite by herself with no better place to go to in the world
she did not reach the house unobserved
just by the gardenhedge she was met by a girl who knew herone of the two or three with whom she had been intimate at school
after making a few inquiries as to how tess came there her friend unheeding her tragic look interrupted with  but where's thy gentleman tess
tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business and leaving her interlocutor clambered over the gardenhedge and thus made her way to the house
as she went up the gardenpath she heard her mother singing by the back door coming in sight of which she perceived mrs durbeyfield on the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet
having performed this without observing tess she went indoors and her daughter followed her
the washingtub stood in the same old place on the same old quarterhogshead and her mother having thrown the sheet aside was about to plunge her arms in anew
whytessmy chil'i thought you was marriedmarried really and truly this timewe sent the cider  yes mother so i am
going to be
noi am married
married
then where's thy husband
oh he's gone away for a time
gone away

the day you said
yes tuesday mother
and now 'tis on'y saturday and he gone away
yes he's gone
what's the meaning o' that
'nation seize such husbands as you seem to get say i
mother
tess went across to joan durbeyfield laid her face upon the matron's bosom and burst into sobs
i don't know how to tell 'ee mother
you said to me and wrote to me that i was not to tell him
but i did tell himi couldn't help itand he went away
o you little foolyou little fool
burst out mrs durbeyfield splashing tess and herself in her agitation
my good god
that ever i should ha' lived to say it but i say it again you little fool
tess was convulsed with weeping the tension of so many days having relaxed at last
i know iti knowi know
she gasped through her sobs
but o my mother i could not help it
he was so goodand i felt the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened
ififit were to be done againi should do the same
i could noti dared notso sinagainst him
but you sinned enough to marry him first
yes yes that's where my misery do lie
but i thought he could get rid o' me by law if he were determined not to overlook it
and o if you knewif you could only half know how i loved himhow anxious i was to have himand how wrung i was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him
tess was so shaken that she could get no further and sank a helpless thing into a chair
well well what's done can't be undone
i'm sure i don't know why children o' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than other people'snot to know better than to blab such a thing as that when he couldn't ha' found it out till too late
here mrs durbeyfield began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied
what your father will say i don't know she continued for he's been talking about the wedding up at rolliver's and the pure drop every day since and about his family getting back to their rightful position through youpoor silly manand now you've made this mess of it
the lordalord
as if to bring matters to a focus tess's father was heard approaching at that moment
he did not however enter immediately and mrs durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself tess keeping out of sight for the present
after her first burst of disappointment joan began to take the mishap as she had taken tess's original trouble as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in the potatocrop as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of desert or folly a chance external impingement to be borne with not a lesson
tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been shifted and new arrangements made
her old bed had been adapted for two younger children
there was no place here for her now
the room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on there
presently her father entered apparently carrying in a live hen
he was a foothaggler now having been obliged to sell his second horse and he travelled with his basket on his arm
the hen had been carried about this morning as it was often carried to show people that he was in his work though it had lain with its legs tied under the table at rolliver's for more than an hour
we've just had up a story about durbeyfield began and thereupon related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn about the clergy originated by the fact of his daughter having married into a clerical family
they was formerly styled 'sir' like my own ancestry he said though nowadays their true style strictly speaking is 'clerk' only
as tess had wished that no great publicity should be given to the event he had mentioned no particulars
he hoped she would remove that prohibition soon
he proposed that the couple should take tess's own name d'urberville as uncorrupted
it was better than her husbands's
he asked if any letter had come from her that day
then mrs durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come but tess unfortunately had come herself
when at length the collapse was explained to him a sullen mortification not usual with durbeyfield overpowered the influence of the cheering glass
yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of others
to think now that this was to be the end o't
said sir john
and i with a family vault under that there church of kingsbere as big as squire jollard's alecellar and my folk lying there in sixes and sevens as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history
and now to be sure what they fellers at rolliver's and the pure drop will say to me
how they'll squint and glane and say 'this is yer mighty match is it this is yer getting back to the true level of yer forefathers in king norman's time'
i feel this is too much joan i shall put an end to myself title and alli can bear it no longer

but she can make him keep her if he's married her
why yes
but she won't think o' doing that
d'ye think he really have married heror is it like the first  poor tess who had heard as far as this could not bear to hear more
the perception that her word could be doubted even here in her own parental house set her mind against the spot as nothing else could have done
how unexpected were the attacks of destiny
and if her father doubted her a little would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much
o she could not live long at home
a few days accordingly were all that she allowed herself here at the end of which time she received a short note from clare informing her that he had gone to the north of england to look at a farm
in her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife and to hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join him
still further to screen her husband from any imputation of unkindness to her she took twentyfive of the fifty pounds clare had given her and handed the sum over to her mother as if the wife of a man like angel clare could well afford it saying that it was a slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past
with this assertion of her dignity she bade them farewell and after that there were lively doings in the durbeyfield household for some time on the strength of tess's bounty her mother saying and indeed believing that the rupture which had arisen between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other
xxxix   it was three weeks after the marriage that clare found himself descending the hill which led to the wellknown parsonage of his father
with his downward course the tower of the church rose into the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come and no living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him still less to expect him
he was arriving like a ghost and the sound of his own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of
the picture of life had changed for him
before this time he had known it but speculatively now he thought he knew it as a practical man though perhaps he did not even yet
nevertheless humanity stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of italian art but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a wiertz museum and with the leer of a study by van beers
his conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond description
after mechanically attempting to pursue his agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened in the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages he concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel
this is the chief thing be not perturbed said the pagan moralist
that was just clare's own opinion
but he was perturbed
let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid said the nazarene
clare chimed in cordially but his heart was troubled all the same
how he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers and earnestly appeal to them as fellowman to fellowmen and ask them to tell him their method
his mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest of an outsider
he was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been brought about by the accident of her being a d'urberville
when he found that tess came of that exhausted ancient line and was not of the new tribes from below as he had fondly dreamed why had he not stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles
this was what he had got by apostasy and his punishment was deserved
then he became weary and anxious and his anxiety increased
he wondered if he had treated her unfairly
he ate without knowing that he ate and drank without tasting
as the hours dropped past as the motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself to his view he perceived how intimately the notion of having tess as a dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and ways
in going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small town a redandblue placard setting forth the great advantages of the empire of brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist
land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms
brazil somewhat attracted him as a new idea
tess could eventually join him there and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here
in brief he was strongly inclined to try brazil especially as the season for going thither was just at hand
with this view he was returning to emminster to disclose his plan to his parents and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without tess short of revealing what had actually separated them
as he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks but his face was thinner now
clare had given his parents no warning of his visit and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool
his father and mother were both in the drawingroom but neither of his brothers was now at home
angel entered and closed the door quietly behind him
butwhere's your wife dear angel
cried his mother
how you surprise us
she is at her mother'stemporarily
i have come home rather in a hurry because i've decided to go to brazil
brazil
why they are all roman catholics there surely
are they
i hadn't thought of that
but even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a papistical land could not displace for long mr and mrs clare's natural interest in their son's marriage
we had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken place said mrs clare and your father sent your godmother's gift to her as you know
of course it was best that none of us should be present especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy and not at her home wherever that may be
it would have embarrassed you and given us no pleasure
your bothers felt that very strongly
now it is done we do not complain particularly if she suits you for the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the gospel

yet i wish i could have seen her first angel or have known a little more about her
we sent her no present of our own not knowing what would best give her pleasure but you must suppose it only delayed
angel there is no irritation in my mind or your father's against you for this marriage but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her
and now you have not brought her
it seems strange
what has happened
he replied that it had been thought best by them that she should to go her parents' home for the present whilst he came there
i don't mind telling you dear mother he said that i always meant to keep her away from this house till i should feel she could come with credit to you
but this idea of brazil is quite a recent one
if i do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey
she will remain at her mother's till i come back
and i shall not see her before you start
he was afraid they would not
his original plan had been as he had said to refrain from bringing her there for some little whilenot to wound their prejudicesfeelingsin any way and for other reasons he had adhered to it
he would have to visit home in the course of a year if he went out at once and it would be possible for them to see her before he started a second timewith her
a hastily prepared supper was brought in and clare made further exposition of his plans
his mother's disappointment at not seeing the bride still remained with her
clare's late enthusiasm for tess had infected her through her maternal sympathies till she had almost fancied that a good thing could come out of nazaretha charming woman out of talbothays dairy
she watched her son as he ate
cannot you describe her
i am sure she is very pretty angel
of that there can be no question
he said with a zest which covered its bitterness
and that she is pure and virtuous goes without question
pure and virtuous of course she is
i can see her quite distinctly
you said the other day that she was fine in figure roundly built had deep red lips like cupid's bow dark eyelashes and brows an immense rope of hair like a ship's cable and large eyes violetyblueyblackish
i did mother
i quite see her
and living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you
scarcely
you were her first love
of course
there are worse wives than these simple rosymouthed robust girls of the farm
certainly i could have wishedwell since my son is to be an agriculturist it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been accustomed to an outdoor life
his father was less inquisitive but when the time came for the chapter from the bible which was always read before evening prayers the vicar observed to mrs clare  i think since angel has come that it will be more appropriate to read the thirtyfirst of proverbs than the chapter which we should have had in the usual course of our reading
yes certainly said mrs clare
the words of king lemuel she could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband
my dear son your father has decided to read us the chapter in proverbs in praise of a virtuous wife
we shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to the absent one
may heaven shield her in all her ways
a lump rose in clare's throat
the portable lectern was taken out from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace the two old servants came in and angel's father began to read at the tenth verse of the aforesaid chapter      who can find a virtuous woman
for her price is far    above rubies
she riseth while it is yet night and    giveth meat to her household
she girdeth her loins    with strength and strengtheneth her arms
she    perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle    goeth not out by night
she looketh well to the ways    of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness
her children arise up and call her blessed her husband    also and he praiseth her
many daughters have done    virtuously but thou excellest them all
when prayers were over his mother said  i could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father read applied in some of its particulars to the woman you have chosen
the perfect woman you see was a working woman not an idler not a fine lady but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for the good of others
'her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her
many daughters have done virtuously but she excelleth them all'
well i wish i could have seen her angel
since she is pure and chaste she would have been refined enough for me
clare could bear this no longer
his eyes were full of tears which seemed like drops of molten lead
he bade a quick good night to these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well who knew neither the world the flesh nor the devil in their own hearts only as something vague and external to themselves
he went to his own chamber
his mother followed him and tapped at his door
clare opened it to discover her standing without with anxious eyes
angel she asked is there something wrong that you go away so soon
i am quite sure you are not yourself
i am not quite mother said he
about her
now my son i know it is thati know it is about her
have you quarrelled in these three weeks
we have not exactly quarrelled he said
but we have had a difference  angelis she a young woman whose history will bear investigation
with a mother's instinct mrs clare had put her finger on the kind of trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son
she is spotless
he replied and felt that if it had sent him to eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie
then never mind the rest
after all there are few purer things in nature then an unsullied country maid
any crudeness of manner which may offend your more educated sense at first will i am sure disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition
such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to clare the secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this marriage which had not been among his early thoughts after the disclosure
true on his own account he cared very little about his career but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on account of his parents and brothers
and now as he looked into the candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on sensible people and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a failure
when his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise deception on his parents
he almost talked to her in his anger as if she had been in the room
and then her cooing voice plaintive in expostulation disturbed the darkness the velvet touch of her lips passed over his brow and he could distinguish in the air the warmth of her breath
this night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how great and good her husband was
but over them both there hung a deeper shade than the shade which angel clare perceived namely the shade of his own limitations
with all his attempted independence of judgement this advanced and wellmeaning young man a sample product of the last fiveandtwenty years was yet the slave to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings
no prophet had told him and he was not prophet enough to tell himself that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of king lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil her moral value having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency
moreover the figure near at hand suffers on such occasion because it shows up its sorriness without shade while vague figures afar off are honoured in that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains
in considering what tess was not he overlooked what she was and forgot that the defective can be more than the entire
xl   at breakfast brazil was the topic and all endeavoured to take a hopeful view of clare's proposed experiment with that country's soil notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farmlabourers who had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months
after breakfast clare went into the little town to wind up such trifling matters as he was concerned with there and to get from the local bank all the money he possessed
on his way back he encountered miss mercy chant by the church from whose walls she seemed to be a sort of emanation
she was carrying an armful of bibles for her class and such was her view of life that events which produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon heran enviable result although in the opinion of angel it was obtained by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism
she had learnt that he was about to leave england and observed what an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be
yes it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense no doubt he replied
but my dear mercy it snaps the continuity of existence
perhaps a cloister would be preferable
a cloister
o angel clare
well
why you wicked man a cloister implies a monk and a monk roman catholicism
and roman catholicism sin and sin damnation
thou art in a parlous state angel clare
i glory in my protestantism
she said severely
then clare thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in which a man does despite to his true principles called her close to him and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he could think of
his momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his welfare
dear mercy he said you must forgive me
i think i am going crazy
she thought that he was and thus the interview ended and clare reentered the vicarage
with the local banker he deposited the jewels till happier days should arise
he also paid into the bank thirty poundsto be sent to tess in a few months as she might require and wrote to her at her parents' home in blackmoor vale to inform her of what he had done
this amount with the sum he had already placed in her handsabout fifty poundshe hoped would be amply sufficient for her wants just at present particularly as in an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father
he deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by informing them of her address and being unaware of what had really happened to estrange the two neither his father nor his mother suggested that he should do so
during the day he left the parsonage for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly
as the last duty before leaving this part of england it was necessary for him to call at the wellbridge farmhouse in which he had spent with tess the first three days of their marriage the trifle of rent having to be paid the key given up of the rooms they had occupied and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left behind
it was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had stretched its gloom over him
yet when he had unlocked the door of the sittingroom and looked into it the memory which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly the first meal together the chatting by the fire with joined hands
the farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit and clare was in the rooms alone for some time
inwardly swollen with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with he went upstairs to her chamber which had never been his
the bed was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving
the mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it
having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour and the leaves and berries were wrinkled
angel took it down and crushed it into the grate
standing there he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise much less a generous one
but had he not been cruelly blinded
in the incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside weteyed
o tess
if you had only told me sooner i would have forgiven you
he mourned
hearing a footstep below he rose and went to the top of the stairs
at the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing and on her turning up her face recognized the pale darkeyed izz huett
mr clare she said i've called to see you and mrs clare and to inquire if ye be well
i thought you might be back here again
this was a girl whose secret he had guessed but who had not yet guessed his an honest girl who loved himone who would have made as good or nearly as good a practical farmer's wife as tess
i am here alone he said we are not living here now
explaining why he had come he asked which way are you going home izz
i have no home at talbothays dairy now sir she said
why is that
izz looked down
it was so dismal there that i left
i am staying out this way
she pointed in a contrary direction the direction in which he was journeying
wellare you going there now
i can take you if you wish for a lift
her olive complexion grew richer in hue
thank 'ee mr clare she said
he soon found the farmer and settled the account for his rent and the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden abandonment of the lodgings
on clare's return to his horse and gig izz jumped up beside him
i am going to leave england izz he said as they drove on
going to brazil
and do mrs clare like the notion of such a journey
she asked
she is not going at presentsay for a year or so
i am going out to reconnoitreto see what life there is like
they sped along eastward for some considerable distance izz making no observation
how are the others
he inquired
how is retty
she was in a sort of nervous state when i zid her last and so thin and hollowcheeked that 'a do seem in a decline
nobody will ever fall in love wi' her any more said izz absently
and marian
izz lowered her voice
marian drinks
indeed
yes
the dairyman has got rid of her
and you
i don't drink and i bain't in a decline
buti am no great things at singing afore breakfast now
how is that
do you remember how neatly you used to turn ''twas down in cupid's gardens' and 'the tailor's breeches' at morning milking
ah yes
when you first came sir that was
not when you had been there a bit
why was that fallingoff
her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of answer
izzhow weak of youfor such as i
he said and fell into reverie
thensuppose i had asked you to marry me
if you had i should have said 'yes' and you would have married a woman who loved 'ee
really
down to the ground
she whispered vehemently
o my god
did you never guess it till now
byandby they reached a branch road to a village
i must get down
i live out there said izz abruptly never having spoken since her avowal
clare slowed the horse
he was incensed against his fate bitterly disposed towards social ordinances for they had cooped him up in a corner out of which there was no legitimate pathway
why not be revenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring manner
i am going to brazil alone izz said he
i have separated from my wife for personal not voyaging reasons
i may never live with her again
i may not be able to love you butwill you go with me instead of her
you truly wish me to go
i do
i have been badly used enough to wish for relief
and you at least love me disinterestedly
yesi will go said izz after a pause
you will
you know what it means izz
it means that i shall live with you for the time you are over therethat's good enough for me
remember you are not to trust me in morals now
but i ought to remind you that it will be wrongdoing in the eyes of civilizationwestern civilization that is to say
i don't mind that no woman do when it comes to agonypoint and there's no other way
then don't get down but sit where you are
he drove past the crossroads one mile two miles without showing any signs of affection
you love me very very much izz
he suddenly asked
i doi have said i do
i loved you all the time we was at the dairy together
more than tess
she shook her head
no she murmured not more than she
how's that
because nobody could love 'ee more than tess did
  she would have laid down her life for 'ee
i could do no more
like the prophet on the top of peor izz huett would fain have spoken perversely at such a moment but the fascination exercised over her rougher nature by tess's character compelled her to grace
clare was silent his heart had risen at these straightforward words from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter
in his throat was something as if a sob had solidified there
his ears repeated she would have laid down her life for 'ee
i could do no more
forget our idle talk izz he said turning the horse's head suddenly
i don't know what i've been saying
i will now drive you back to where your lane branches off
so much for honesty towards 'ee
ohow can i bear ithow can ihow can i
izz huett burst into wild tears and beat her forehead as she saw what she had done
do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one
o izz don't spoil it by regret
she stilled herself by degrees
very well sir
perhaps i didn't know what i was saying either whwhen i agreed to go
i wishwhat cannot be
because i have a loving wife already
yes yes
you have
they reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an hour earlier and she hopped down
izzplease please forget my momentary levity
he cried
it was so illconsidered so illadvised
forget it
never never
o it was no levity to me
he felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry conveyed and in a sorrow that was inexpressible leapt down and took her hand
well but izz we'll part friends anyhow
you don't know what i've had to bear
she was a really generous girl and allowed no further bitterness to mar their adieux
i forgive 'ee sir
she said
now izz he said while she stood beside him there forcing himself to the mentor's part he was far from feeling i want you to tell marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman and not to give way to folly
promise that and tell retty that there are more worthy men than i in the world that for my sake she is to act wisely and wellremember the wordswisely and wellfor my sake
i send this message to them as a dying man to the dying for i shall never see them again
and you izzy you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery
women may be bad but they are not so bad as men in these things
on that one account i can never forget you
be always the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been and think of me as a worthless lover but a faithful friend
promise
she gave the promise
heaven bless and keep you sir
goodbye
he drove on but no sooner had izz turned into the lane and clare was out of sight than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of racking anguish and it was with a strained unnatural face that she entered her mother's cottage late that night
nobody ever was told how izz spent the dark hours that intervened between angel clare's parting from her and her arrival home
clare too after bidding the girl farewell was wrought to aching thoughts and quivering lips
but his sorrow was not for izz
that evening he was within a featherweight's turn of abandoning his road to the nearest station and driving across that elevated dorsal line of south wessex which divided him from his tess's home
it was neither a contempt for her nature nor the probable state of her heart which deterred him
no it was a sense that despite her love as corroborated by izz's admission the facts had not changed
if he was right at first he was right now
and the momentum of the course on which he had embarked tended to keep him going in it unless diverted by a stronger more sustained force than had played upon him this afternoon
he could soon come back to her
he took the train that night for london and five days after shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of embarkation
xli   from the foregoing events of the wintertime let us press on to an october day more than eight months subsequent to the parting of clare and tess
we discover the latter in changed conditions instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage as at an earlier time when she was no bride instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary period she can produce only a flattened purse
after again leaving marlott her home she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairywork near portbredy to the west of the blackmoor valley equally remote from her native place and from talbothays
she preferred this to living on his allowance
mentally she remained in utter stagnation a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked
her consciousness was at that other dairy at that other season in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her therehe who the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own had disappeared like a shape in a vision
the dairywork lasted only till the milk began to lessen for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at talbothays but had done duty as a supernumerary only
however as harvest was now beginning she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation and this continued till harvest was done
of the fiveandtwenty pounds which had remained to her of clare's allowance after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them she had as yet spent but little
but there now followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns
she could not bear to let them go
angel had put them into her hand had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her his touch had consecrated them to souvenirs of himselfthey appeared to have had as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own experiencesand to disperse them was like giving away relics
but she had to do it and one by one they left her hands
she had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to time but she concealed her circumstances
when her money had almost gone a letter from her mother reached her
joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of the house which required entire renewal but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for
new rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required which with the previous bill would amount to a sum of twenty pounds
as her husband was a man of means and had doubtless returned by this time could she not send them the money
tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from angel's bankers and the case being so deplorable as soon as the sum was received she sent the twenty as requested
part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing leaving only a nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand
when the last pound had gone a remark of angel's that whenever she required further resources she was to apply to his father remained to be considered
but the more tess thought of the step the more reluctant was she to take it
the same delicacy pride false shame whatever it may be called on clare's account which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her
they probably despised her already how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant
the consequence was that by no effort could the parson's daughterinlaw bring herself to let him know her state
her reluctance to communicate with her husband's parents might she thought lessen with the lapse of time but with her own the reverse obtained
on her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort hoping against hope that his journey to brazil would result in a short stay only after which he would come to fetch her or that he would write for her to join him in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world
this hope she still fostered
to let her parents know that she was a deserted wife dependent now that she had relieved their necessities on her own hands for a living after the clat of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first attempt would be too much indeed
the set of brilliants returned to her mind
where clare had deposited them she did not know and it mattered little if it were true that she could only use and not sell them
even were they absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which was not essentially hers at all
meanwhile her husband's days had been by no means free from trial
at this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near curitiba in brazil having been drenched with thunderstorms and persecuted by other hardships in common with all the english farmers and farmlabourers who just at this time were deluded into going thither by the promises of the brazilian government and by the baseless assumption that those frames which ploughing and sowing on english uplands had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been born could resist equally well all the weathers by which they were surprised on brazilian plains
to return
thus it happened that when the last of tess's sovereigns had been spent she was unprovided with others to take their place while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get employment
not being aware of the rarity of intelligence energy health and willingness in any sphere of life she refrained from seeking an indoor occupation fearing towns large houses people of means and social sophistication and of manners other than rural
from that direction of gentility black care had come
society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience of it
but she had no proof of this and her instinct in the circumstances was to avoid its purlieus
the small dairies to the west beyond portbredy in which she had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer required no further aid
room would probably have been made for her at talbothays if only out of sheer compassion but comfortable as her life had been there she could not go back
the anticlimax would be too intolerable and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized husband
she could not have borne their pity and their whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation though she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every individual there so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each
it was the interchange of ideas about her that made her sensitiveness wince
tess could not account for this distinction she simply knew that she felt it
she was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had reached her from marian
marian had somehow heard that tess was separated from her husbandprobably through izz huettand the goodnatured and now tippling girl deeming tess in trouble had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy and would like to see her there where there was room for other hands if it was really true that she worked again as of old
with the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's forgiveness began to leave her and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled ondisconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step obliterating her identity giving no thought to accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness if not to theirs
among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the attention she excited by her appearance a certain bearing of distinction which she had caught from clare being superadded to her natural attractiveness
whilst the clothes lasted which had been prepared for her marriage these casual glances of interest caused her no inconvenience but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper of a fieldwoman rude words were addressed to her more than once but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular november afternoon
she had preferred the country west of the river brit to the upland farm for which she was now bound because for one thing it was nearer to the home of her husband's father and to hover about that region unrecognized with the notion that she might decide to call at the vicarage some day gave her pleasure
but having once decided to try the higher and drier levels she pressed back eastward marching afoot towards the village of chalknewton where she meant to pass the night
the lane was long and unvaried and owing to the rapid shortening of the days dusk came upon her before she was aware
she had reached the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in glimpses when she heard footsteps behind her back and in a few moments she was overtaken by a man
he stepped up alongside tess and said  good night my pretty maid to which she civilly replied
the light still remaining in the sky lit up her face though the landscape was nearly dark
the man turned and stared hard at her
why surely it is the young wench who was at trantridge awhile young squire d'urberville's friend
i was there at that time though i don't live there now
she recognized in him the welltodo boor whom angel had knocked down at the inn for addressing her coarsely
a spasm of anguish shot through her and she returned him no answer
be honest enough to own it and that what i said in the town was true though your fancyman was so up about ithey my sly one
you ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his considering
still no answer came from tess
there seemed only one escape for her hunted soul
she suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the wind and without looking behind her ran along the road till she came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation
into this she plunged and did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade to be safe against any possibility of discovery
under foot the leaves were dry and the foliage of some holly bushes which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off draughts
she scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them into a large heap making a sort of nest in the middle
into this tess crept
such sleep as she got was naturally fitful she fancied she heard strange noises but persuaded herself that they were caused by the breeze
she thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the other side of the globe while she was here in the cold
was there another such a wretched being as she in the world
tess asked herself and thinking of her wasted life said all is vanity
she repeated the words mechanically till she reflected that this was a most inadequate thought for modern days
solomon had thought as far as that more than two thousand years ago she herself though not in the van of thinkers had got much further
if all were only vanity who would mind it
all was alas worse than vanityinjustice punishment exaction death
the wife of angel clare put her hand to her brow and felt its curve and the edges of her eyesockets perceptible under the soft skin and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare
i wish it were now she said
in the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound among the leaves
it might be the wind yet there was scarcely any wind
sometimes it was a palpitation sometimes a flutter sometimes it was a sort of gasp or gurgle
soon she was certain that the noises came from wild creatures of some kind the more so when originating in the boughs overhead they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon the ground
had she been ensconced here under other and more pleasant conditions she would have become alarmed but outside humanity she had at present no fear
day at length broke in the sky
when it had been day aloft for some little while it became day in the wood
directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world's active hours had grown strong she crept from under her hillock of leaves and looked around boldly
then she perceived what had been going on to disturb her
the plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down at this spot into a peak which ended it hitherward outside the hedge being arable ground
under the trees several pheasants lay about their rich plumage dabbled with blood some were dead some feebly twitching a wing some staring up at the sky some pulsating quickly some contorted some stretched outall of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more
tess guessed at once the meaning of this
the birds had been driven down into this corner the day before by some shootingparty and while those that had dropped dead under the shot or had died before nightfall had been searched for and carried off many badly wounded birds had escaped and hidden themselves away or risen among the thick boughs where they had maintained their position till they grew weaker with loss of blood in the nighttime when they had fallen one by one as she had heard them
she had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood looking over hedges or peeping through bushes and pointing their guns strangely accoutred a bloodthirsty light in their eyes
she had been told that rough and brutal as they seemed just then they were not like this all the year round but were in fact quite civil persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter when like the inhabitants of the malay peninsula they ran amuck and made it their purpose to destroy lifein this case harmless feathered creatures brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these propensitiesat once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their weaker fellows in nature's teeming family
with the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as much as for herself tess's first thought was to put the still living birds out of their torture and to this end with her own hands she broke the necks of as many as she could find leaving them to lie where she had found them till the gamekeepers should comeas they probably would cometo look for them a second time
poor darlingsto suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours
she exclaimed her tears running down as she killed the birds tenderly
and not a twinge of bodily pain about me
i be not mangled and i be not bleeding and i have two hands to feed and clothe me
she was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the night based on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in nature
xlii   it was now broad day and she started again emerging cautiously upon the highway
but there was no need for caution not a soul was at hand and tess went onward with fortitude her recollection of the birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own if she could once rise high enough to despise opinion
but that she could not do so long as it was held by clare
she reached chalknewton and breakfasted at an inn where several young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks
somehow she felt hopeful for was it not possible that her husband also might say these same things to her even yet
she was bound to take care of herself on the chance of it and keep off these casual lovers
to this end tess resolved to run no further risks from her appearance
as soon as she got out of the village she entered a thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest fieldgowns which she had never put on even at the dairynever since she had worked among the stubble at marlott
she also by a felicitous thought took a handkerchief from her bundle and tied it round her face under her bonnet covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples as if she were suffering from toothache
then with her little scissors by the aid of a pocket lookingglass she mercilessly nipped her eyebrows off and thus insured against aggressive admiration she went on her uneven way
what a mommet of a maid
said the next man who met her to a companion
tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him
but i don't care
she said
o noi don't care
i'll always be ugly now because angel is not here and i have nobody to take care of me
my husband that was is gone away and never will love me any more but i love him just the same and hate all other men and like to make 'em think scornfully of me
thus tess walks on a figure which is part of the landscape a fieldwoman pure and simple in winter guise a gray serge cape a red woollen cravat a stuff skirt covered by a whiteybrown rough wrapper and buffleather gloves
every thread of that old attire has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops the burn of sunbeams and the stress of winds
there is no sign of young passion in her now        the maiden's mouth is cold      
 
fold over simple fold      binding her head
inside this exterior over which the eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient almost inorganic there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well for its years of the dust and ashes of things of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love
next day the weather was bad but she trudged on the honesty directness and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her but little
her object being a winter's occupation and a winter's home there was no time to lose
her experience of short hirings had been such that she was determined to accept no more
thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place whence marian had written to her which she determined to make use of as a last shift only its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of tempting
first she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment and as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless applied next for the less light till beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance that she liked best she ended with the heavy and course pursuits which she liked leastwork on arable land work of such roughness indeed as she would never have deliberately voluteered for
towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk tableland or plateau bosomed with semiglobular tumulias if cybele the manybreasted were supinely extended therewhich stretched between the valley of her birth and the valley of her love
here the air was dry and cold and the long cartroads were blown white and dusty within a few hours after rain
there were few trees or none those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed down with the quickset by the tenantfarmers the natural enemies of tree bush and brake
in the middle distance ahead of her she could see the summits of bulbarrow and of nettlecombe tout and they seemed friendly
they had a low and unassuming aspect from this upland though as approached on the other side from blackmoor in her childhood they were as lofty bastions against the sky
southerly at many miles' distance and over the hills and ridges coastward she could discern a surface like polished steel it was the english channel at a point far out towards france
before her in a slight depression were the remains of a village
she had in fact reached flintcombash the place of marian's sojourn
there seemed to be no help for it hither she was doomed to come
the stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind but it was time to rest from searching and she resolved to stay particularly as it began to rain
at the entrance to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into the road and before applying for a lodging she stood under its shelter and watched the evening close in
who would think i was mrs angel clare
she said
the wall felt warm to her back and shoulders and she found that immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace the heat of which came through the bricks
she warmed her hands upon them and also put her cheekred and moist with the drizzleagainst their comforting surface
the wall seemed to be the only friend she had
she had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night
tess could hear the occupants of the cottagegathered together after their day's labourtalking to each other within and the rattle of their supperplates was also audible
but in the villagestreet she had seen no soul as yet
the solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure who though the evening was cold wore the print gown and the tiltbonnet of summer time
tess instinctively thought it might be marian and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom surely enough it was she
marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly and decidedly shabbier in attire
at any previous period of her existence tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions but her loneliness was excessive and she responded readily to marian's greeting
marian was quite respectful in her inquiries but seemed much moved by the fact that tess should still continue in no better condition than at first though she had dimly heard of the separation
tessmrs clarethe dear wife of dear he
and is it really so bad as this my child
why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way
anybody been beating 'ee
not he
no no no
i merely did it not to be clipsed or colled marian
she pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts
and you've got no collar on tess had been accustomed to wear a little white collar at the dairy
i know it marian
you've lost it travelling
i've not lost it
the truth is i don't care anything about my looks and so i didn't put it on
and you don't wear your weddingring
yes i do but not in public
i wear it round my neck on a ribbon
i don't wish people to think who i am by marriage or that i am married at all it would be so awkward while i lead my present life
marian paused
but you be a gentleman's wife and it seems hardly fair that you should live like this
o yes it is quite fair though i am very unhappy
well well
he married youand you can be unhappy
wives are unhappy sometimes from no fault of their husbandsfrom their own
you've no faults deary that i'm sure of
and he's none
so it must be something outside ye both
marian dear marian will you do me a good turn without asking questions
my husband has gone abroad and somehow i have overrun my allowance so that i have to fall back upon my old work for a time
do not call me mrs clare but tess as before
do they want a hand here
o yes they'll take one always because few care to come
'tis a starveacre place
corn and swedes are all they grow
though i be here myself i feel 'tis a pity for such as you to come
but you used to be as good a dairywoman as i
yes but i've got out o' that since i took to drink
lord that's the only comfort i've got now
if you engage you'll be set swedehacking
that's what i be doing but you won't like it
oanything
will you speak for me
you will do better by speaking for yourself
very well
now marian remembernothing about him if i get the place
i don't wish to bring his name down to the dirt
marian who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than tess promised anything she asked
this is paynight she said and if you were to come with me you would know at once
i be real sorry that you are not happy but 'tis because he's away i know
you couldn't be unhappy if he were here even if he gie'd ye no moneyeven if he used you like a drudge
that's true i could not
they walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse which was almost sublime in its dreariness
there was not a tree within sight there was not at this season a green pasturenothing but fallow and turnips everywhere in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels
tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of workfolk had received their wages and then marian introduced her
the farmer himself it appeared was not at home but his wife who represented him this evening made no objection to hiring tess on her agreeing to remain till old ladyday
female fieldlabour was seldom offered now and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women could perform as readily as men
having signed the agreement there was nothing more for tess to do at present than to get a lodging and she found one in the house at whose gablewall she had warmed herself
it was a poor subsistence that she had ensured but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate
that night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address in case a letter should arrive at marlott from her husband
but she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation it might have brought reproach upon him
xliii   there was no exaggeration in marian's definition of flintcombash farm as a starveacre place
the single fat thing on the soil was marian herself and she was an importation
of the three classes of village the village cared for by its lord the village cared for by itself and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord in other words the village of a resident squires's tenantry the village of free or copyholders and the absenteeowner's village farmed with the land this place flintcombash was the third
but tess set to work
patience that blending of moral courage with physical timidity was now no longer a minor feature in mrs angel clare and it sustained her
the swedefield in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch on the highest ground of the farm rising above stony lanchets or lynchetsthe outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous cusped and phallic shapes
the upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the livestock and it was the business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker that it might be eaten also
every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed the whole field was in colour a desolate drab it was a complexion without features as if a face from chin to brow should be only an expanse of skin
the sky wore in another colour the same likeness a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone
so these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long the white face looking down on the brown face and the brown face looking up at the white face without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies
nobody came near them and their movements showed a mechanical regularity their forms standing enshrouded in hessian wroppers sleeved brown pinafores tied behind to the bottom to keep their gowns from blowing aboutscant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets
the pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early italian conception of the two marys
they worked on hour after hour unconscious of the forlorn aspect they bore in the landscape not thinking of the justice or injustice of their lot
even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream
in the afternoon the rain came on again and marian said that they need not work any more
but if they did not work they would not be paid so they worked on
it was so high a situation this field that the rain had no occasion to fall but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through
tess had not known till now what was really meant by that
there are degrees of dampness and a very little is called being wet through in common talk
but to stand working slowly in a field and feel the creep of rainwater first in legs and shoulders then on hips and head then at back front and sides and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down demands a distinct modicum of stoicism even of valour
yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed
they were both young and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at talbothays dairy that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts in substance to all emotionally to these
tess would fain not have conversed with marian of the man who was legally if not actually her husband but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating marian's remarks
and thus as has been said though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness they lived all this afternoon in memories of green sunny romantic talbothays
you can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o' froom valley from here when 'tis fine said marian
ah
can you
said tess awake to the new value of this locality
so the two forces were at work here as everywhere the inherent will to enjoy and the circumstantial will against enjoyment
marian's will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag from which she invited tess to drink
tess's unassisted power of dreaming however being enough for her sublimation at present she declined except the merest sip and then marian took a pull from the spirits
i've got used to it she said and can't leave it off now
'tis my only comfortyou see i lost him you didn't and you can do without it perhaps
tess thought her loss as great as marian's but upheld by the dignity of being angel's wife in the letter at least she accepted marian's differentiation
amid this scene tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon rains
when it was not swedegrubbing it was swedetrimming in which process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a billhook before storing the roots for future use
at this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers
still tess hoped
she had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of clare's character would lead him to rejoin her
marian primed to a humorous mood would discover the queershaped flints aforesaid and shriek with laughter tess remaining severely obtuse
they often looked across the country to where the var or froom was know to stretch even though they might not be able to see it and fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist imagined the old times they had spent out there
ah said marian how i should like another or two of our old set to come here
then we could bring up talbothays every day here afield and talk of he and of what nice times we had there and o' the old things we used to know and make it all come back a'most in seeming
marian's eyes softened and her voice grew vague as the visions returned
i'll write to izz huett she said
she's biding at home doing nothing now i know and i'll tell her we be here and ask her to come and perhaps retty is well enough now
tess had nothing to say against the proposal and the next she heard of this plan for importing old talbothays' joys was two or three days later when marian informed her that izz had replied to her inquiry and had promised to come if she could
there had not been such a winter for years
it came on in stealthy and measured glides like the moves of a chessplayer
one morning the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument
every twig was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night giving it four times its usual stoutness the whole bush or tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and horizon
cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere hanging like loops of white worsted from salient points of the outhouses posts and gates
after this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost when strange birds from behind the north pole began to arrive silently on the upland of flintcombash gaunt spectral creatures with tragical eyeseyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had ever conceived in curdling temperatures that no man could endure which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snowhills by the shooting light of the aurora been half blinded by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions and retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered
these nameless birds came quite near to tess and marian but of all they had seen which humanity would never see they brought no account
the traveller's ambition to tell was not theirs and with dumb impassivity they dismissed experiences which they did not value for the immediate incidents of this homely uplandthe trivial movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as food
then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country
there came a moisture which was not of rain and a cold which was not of frost
it chilled the eyeballs of the twain made their brows ache penetrated to their skeletons affecting the surface of the body less than its core
they knew that it meant snow and in the night the snow came
tess who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it awoke in the night and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds
when she lit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside and had also come down the chimney so that it lay soledeep upon the floor on which her shoes left tracks when she moved about
without the storm drove so fast as to create a snowmist in the kitchen but as yet it was too dark outofdoors to see anything
tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes and by the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reeddrawing in the barn till the weather changed
as soon therefore as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of grays they blew out the lamp wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners tied their woollen cravats round their necks and across their chests and started for the barn
the snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud and individual flakes could not be seen
the blast smelt of icebergs arctic seas whales and white bears carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it
they trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy fields keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges which however acted as strainers rather than screens
the air afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it twisted and spun them eccentrically suggesting an achromatic chaos of things
but both the young women were fairly cheerful such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting
haha
the cunning northern birds knew this was coming said marian
depend upon't they keep just in front o't all the way from the north star
your husband my dear is i make no doubt having scorching weather all this time
lord if he could only see his pretty wife now
not that this weather hurts your beauty at allin fact it rather does it good
you mustn't talk about him to me marian said tess severely
well butsurely you care for'n
do you
instead of answering tess with tears in her eyes impulsively faced in the direction in which she imagined south america to lie and putting up her lips blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind
well well i know you do
but 'pon my body it is a rum life for a married couple
therei won't say another word
well as for the weather it won't hurt us in the wheatbarn but reeddrawing is fearful hard workworse than swedehacking
i can stand it because i'm stout but you be slimmer than i  i can't think why maister should have set 'ee at it
they reached the wheatbarn and entered it
one end of the long structure was full of corn the middle was where the reeddrawing was carried on and there had already been placed in the reedpress the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the women to draw from during the day
why here's izz
said marian
izz it was and she came forward
she had walked all the way from her mother's home on the previous afternoon and not deeming the distance so great had been belated arriving however just before the snow began and sleeping at the alehouse
the farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she came today and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay
in addition to tess marian and izz there were two women from a neighbouring village two amazonian sisters whom tess with a start remembered as dark car the queen of spades and her junior the queen of diamondsthose who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at trantridge
they showed no recognition of her and possibly had none for they had been under the influence of liquor on that occasion and were only temporary sojourners there as here
they did all kinds of men's work by preference including wellsinking hedging ditching and excavating without any sense of fatigue
noted reeddrawers were they too and looked round upon the other three with some superciliousness
putting on their gloves all set to work in a row in front of the press an erection formed of two posts connected by a crossbeam under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward the beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights and lowered as the sheaves diminished
the day hardened in colour the light coming in at the barndoors upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky
the girls pulled handful after handful from the press but by reason of the presence of the strange women who were recounting scandals marian and izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do
presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse and the farmer rode up to the barndoor
when he had dismounted he came close to tess and remained looking musingly at the side of her face
she had not turned at first but his fixed attitude led her to look round when she perceived that her employer was the native of trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the highroad because of his allusion to her history
he waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside when he said so you be the young woman who took my civility in such ill part
be drowned if i didn't think you might be as soon as i heard of your being hired
well you thought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancyman and the second time on the road when you bolted but now i think i've got the better you
he concluded with a hard laugh
tess between the amazons and the farmer like a bird caught in a clapnet returned no answer continuing to pull the straw
she could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had nothing to fear from her employer's gallantry it was rather the tyranny induced by his mortification at clare's treatment of him
upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to endure it
you thought i was in love with 'ee i suppose
some women are such fools to take every look as serious earnest
but there's nothing like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o' young wenches' heads and you've signed and agreed till ladyday
now are you going to beg my pardon
i think you ought to beg mine
very wellas you like
but we'll see which is master here
be they all the sheaves you've done today
yes sir
'tis a very poor show
just see what they've done over there pointing to the two stalwart women
the rest too have done better than you
they've all practised it before and i have not
and i thought it made no difference to you as it is task work and we are only paid for what we do
oh but it does
i want the barn cleared
i am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do
he looked sullenly at her and went away
tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place but anything was better than gallantry
when two o'clock arrived the professional reeddrawers tossed off the last halfpint in their flagon put down their hooks tied their last sheaves and went away
marian and izz would have done likewise but on hearing that tess meant to stay to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill they would not leave her
looking out at the snow which still fell marian exclaimed now we've got it all to ourselves
and so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy and of course the incidents of their affection for angel clare
izz and marian said mrs angel clare with a dignity which was extremely touching seeing how very little of a wife she was i can't join in talk with you now as i used to do about mr clare you will see that i cannot because although he is gone away from me for the present he is my husband
izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls who had loved clare
he was a very splendid lover no doubt she said but i don't think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon
he had to gohe was obliged to go to see about the land over there
pleaded tess
he might have tided 'ee over the winter
ahthat's owing to an accidenta misunderstanding and we won't argue it tess answered with tearfulness in her words
perhaps there's a good deal to be said for him
he did not go away like some husbands without telling me and i can always find out where he is
after this they continued for some long time in a reverie as they went on seizing the ears of corn drawing out the straw gathering it under their arms and cutting off the ears with their billhooks nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook
then tess suddenly flagged and sank down upon the heap of wheatears at her feet
i knew you wouldn't be able to stand it
cried marian
it wants harder flesh than yours for this work
just then the farmer entered
oh that's how you get on when i am away he said to her
but it is my own loss she pleaded
not yours
i want it finished he said doggedly as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door
don't 'ee mind him there's a dear said marian
i've worked here before
now you go and lie down there and izz and i will make up your number
i don't like to let you do that
i'm taller than you too
however she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile and reclined on a heap of pulltailsthe refuse after the straight straw had been drawnthrown up at the further side of the barn
her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the reopening the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work
she lay in a state of percipience without volition and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches
she could hear from her corner in addition to these noises the murmur of their voices
she felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached but their voices were so low that she could not catch the words
at last tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying and persuading herself that she felt better she got up and resumed work
then izz huett broke down
she had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening had gone to bed at midnight and had risen again at five o'clock
marian alone thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering
tess urged izz to leave off agreeing as she felt better to finish the day without her and make equal division of the number of sheaves
izz accepted the offer gratefully and disappeared through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging
marian as was the case every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle began to feel in a romantic vein
i should not have thought it of himnever
she said in a dreamy tone
and i loved him so
i didn't mind his having you
but this about izz is too bad
tess in her start at the words narrowly missed cutting off a finger with the billhook
is it about my husband
she stammered
well yes
izz said 'don't 'ee tell her' but i am sure i can't help it
it was what he wanted izz to do
he wanted her to go off to brazil with him
tess's face faded as white as the scene without and its curves straightened
and did izz refuse to go
she asked
i don't know
anyhow he changed his mind
poohthen he didn't mean it
'twas just a man's jest
yes he did for he drove her a goodways towards the station
he didn't take her
they pulled on in silence till tess without any premonitory symptoms burst out crying
there
said marian
now i wish i hadn't told 'ee
no
it is a very good thing that you have done
i have been living on in a thirtover lackaday way and have not seen what it may lead to
i ought to have sent him a letter oftener
he said i could not go to him but he didn't say i was not to write as often as i liked
i won't dally like this any longer
i have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him
the dim light in the barn grew dimmer and they could see to work no longer
when tess had reached home that evening and had entered into the privacy of her little whitewashed chamber she began impetuously writing a letter to clare
but falling into doubt she could not finish it
afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it next her heart and retained it on her finger all night as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this elusive lover of hers who could propose that izz should go with him abroad so shortly after he had left her
knowing that how could she write entreaties to him or show that she cared for him any more
xliv   by the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the direction which they had taken more than once of lateto the distant emminster vicarage
it was through her husband's parents that she had been charged to send a letter to clare if she desired and to write to them direct if in difficulty
but that sense of her having morally no claim upon him had always led tess to suspend her impulse to send these notes and to the family at the vicarage therefore as to her own parents since her marriage she was virtually nonexistent
this selfeffacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing by way of favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts
she had set herself to stand or fall by her qualities and to waive such merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been established for her by the flimsy fact of a member of that family in a season of impulse writing his name in a churchbook beside hers
but now that she was stung to a fever by izz's tale there was a limit to her powers of renunciation
why had her husband not written to her
he had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed but he had not sent a line to notify his address
was he really indifferent
but was he ill
was it for her to make some advance
surely she might summon the courage of solicitude call at the vicarage for intelligence and express her grief at his silence
if angel's father were the good man she had heard him represented to be he would be able to enter into her heartstarved situation
her social hardships she could conceal
to leave the farm on a weekday was not in her power sunday was the only possible opportunity
flintcombash being in the middle of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet it would be necessary to walk
and the distance being fifteen miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising early
a fortnight later when the snow had gone and had been followed by a hard black frost she took advantage of the state of the roads to try the experiment
at four o'clock that sunday morning she came downstairs and stepped out into the starlight
the weather was still favourable the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil
marian and izz were much interested in her excursion knowing that the journey concerned her husband
their lodgings were in a cottage a little further along the lane but they came and assisted tess in her departure and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parentsinlaw though she knowing of the austere and calvinistic tenets of old mr clare was indifferent and even doubtful
a year had now elapsed since her sad marriage but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion a soft gray woollen gown with white crape quilling against the pink skin of her face and neck and a black velvet jacket and hat
'tis a thousand pities your husband can't see 'ee nowyou do look a real beauty
said izz huett regarding tess as she stood on the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow candlelight within
izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself to the situation she could not beno woman with a heart bigger than a hazelnut could beantagonistic to tess in her presence the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and strength quite unusual curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry
with a final tug and touch here and a slight brush there they let her go and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the foredawn
they heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her full pace
even izz hoped she would win and though without any particular respect for her own virtue felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by clare
it was a year ago all but a day that clare had married tess and only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her
still to start on a brisk walk and on such an errand as hers on a dry clear wintry morning through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs'backs was not depressing and there is no doubt that her dream at starting was to win the heart of her motherinlaw tell her whole history to that lady enlist her on her side and so gain back the truant
in time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which stretched the loamy vale of blackmoor now lying misty and still in the dawn
instead of the colourless air of the uplands the atmosphere down there was a deep blue
instead of the great enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to toil there were little fields below her of less than halfadozen acres so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes of a net
here the landscape was whiteybrown down there as in froom valley it was always green
yet it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape and she did not love it as formerly
beauty to her as to all who have felt lay not in the thing but in what the thing symbolized
keeping the vale on her right she steered steadily westward passing above the hintocks crossing at rightangles the highroad from shertonabbas to casterbridge and skirting dogbury hill and highstoy with the dell between them called the devil's kitchen
still following the elevated way she reached crossinhand where the stone pillar stands desolate and silent to mark the site of a miracle or murder or both
three miles further she cut across the straight and deserted roman road called longash lane leaving which as soon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small town or village of evershead being now about halfway over the distance
she made a halt here and breakfasted a second time heartily enoughnot at the sowandacorn for she avoided inns but at a cottage by the church
the second half of her journey was through a more gentle country by way of benvill lane
but as the mileage lessened between her and the spot of her pilgrimage so did tess's confidence decrease and her enterprise loom out more formidably
she saw her purpose in such staring lines and the landscape so faintly that she was sometimes in danger of losing her way
however about noon she paused by a gate on the edge of the basin in which emminster and its vicarage lay
the square tower beneath which she knew that at that moment the vicar and his congregation were gathered had a severe look in her eyes
she wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a weekday
such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who had chosen sunday never realizing the necessities of her case
but it was incumbent upon her to go on now
she took off the thick boots in which she had walked thus far put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather and stuffing the former into the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find them again descended the hill the freshness of colour she had derived from the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage
tess hoped for some accident that might favour her but nothing favoured her
the shrubs on the vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in the frosty breeze she could not feel by any stretch of imagination dressed to her highest as she was that the house was the residence of near relations and yet nothing essential in nature or emotion divided her from them in pains pleasures thoughts birth death and afterdeath they were the same
she nerved herself by an effort entered the swinggate and rang the doorbell
the thing was done there could be no retreat
no the thing was not done
nobody answered to her ringing
the effort had to be risen to and made again
she rang a second time and the agitation of the act coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles' walk led her to support herself while she waited by resting her hand on her hip and her elbow against the wall of the porch
the wind was so nipping that the ivyleaves had become wizened and gray each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves
a piece of bloodstained paper caught up from some meatbuyer's dustheap beat up and down the road without the gate too flimsy to rest too heavy to fly away and a few straws kept it company
the second peal had been louder and still nobody came
then she walked out of the porch opened the gate and passed through
and though she looked dubiously at the housefront as if inclined to return it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate
a feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized though how she could not tell and orders been given not to admit her
tess went as far as the corner
she had done all she could do but determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future distress she walked back again quite past the house looking up at all the windows
ahthe explanation was that they were all at church every one
she remembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon the household servants included going to morningservice and as a consequence eating cold food when they came home
it was therefore only necessary to wait till the service was over
she would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot and she started to get past the church into the lane
but as she reached the churchyardgate the people began pouring out and tess found herself in the midst of them
the emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of small countrytownsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger
she quickened her pace and ascended the road by which she had come to find a retreat between its hedges till the vicar's family should have lunched and it might be convenient for them to receive her
she soon distanced the churchgoers except two youngish men who linked arminarm were beating up behind her at a quick step
as they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest discourse and with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality of her husband's tones
the pedestrians were his two brothers
forgetting all her plans tess's one dread was lest they should overtake her now in her disorganized condition before she was prepared to confront them for though she felt that they could not identify her she instinctively dreaded their scrutiny
the more briskly they walked the more briskly walked she
they were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch or dinner to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a long service
only one person had preceded tess up the hilla ladylike young woman somewhat interesting though perhaps a trifle guinde and prudish
tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothersinlaw brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation
they said nothing however which particularly interested her till observing the young lady still further in front one of them remarked there is mercy chant
let us overtake her
tess knew the name
it was the woman who had been destined for angel's lifecompanion by his and her parents and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self
she would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment for one of the brothers proceeded to say ah
poor angel poor angel
i never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid or whatever she may be
it is a queer business apparently
whether she has joined him yet or not i don't know but she had not done so some months ago when i heard from him
i can't say
he never tells me anything nowadays
his illconsidered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions
tess beat up the long hill still faster but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice
at last they outsped her altogether and passed her by
the young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned
then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands and the three went on together
they soon reached the summit of the hill and evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade slackened pace and turned all three aside to the gate whereat tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it
during their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge carefully with his umbrella and dragged something to light
here's a pair of old boots he said
thrown away i suppose by some tramp or other
some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot perhaps and so excite our sympathies said miss chant
yes it must have been for they are excellent walkingbootsby no means worn out
what a wicked thing to do
i'll carry them home for some poor person
cuthbert clare who had been the one to find them picked them up for her with the crook of his stick and tess's boots were appropriated
she who had heard this walked past under the screen of her woollen veil till presently looking back she perceived that the church party had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill
thereupon our heroine resumed her walk
tears blinding tears were running down her face
she knew that it was all sentiment all baseless impressibility which had caused her to read the scene as her own condemnation nevertheless she could not get over it she could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward omens
it was impossible to think of returning to the vicarage
angel's wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by thoseto hersuperfine clerics
innocently as the slight had been inflicted it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the sons and not the father who despite his narrowness was far less starched and ironed than they and had to the full the gift of charity
as she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which they had been subjected and felt how hopeless life was for their owner
ah
she said still sighing in pity of herself they didn't know that i wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these pretty ones he bought for menothey did not know it
and they didn't think that he chose the colour o' my pretty frocknohow could they
if they had known perhaps they would not have cared for they don't care much for him poor thing
then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows and she went her way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her estimating her fatherinlaw by his sons
her present condition was precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old mr and mrs clare
their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme cases when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among mankind failed to win their interest or regard
in jumping at publicans and sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries of scribes and pharisees and this defect or limitation might have recommended their own daughterinlaw to them at this moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love
thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come not altogether full of hope but full of a conviction that a crisis in her life was approaching
no crisis apparently had supervened and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that starveacre farm till she could again summon courage to face the vicarage
she did indeed take sufficient interest in herself to throw up her veil on this return journey as if to let the world see that she could at least exhibit a face such as mercy chant could not show
but it was done with a sorry shake of the head
it is nothingit is nothing
she said
nobody loves it nobody sees it
who cares about the looks of a castaway like me
her journey back was rather a meander than a march
it had no sprightliness no purpose only a tendency
along the tedious length of benvill lane she began to grow tired and she leant upon gates and paused by milestones
she did not enter any house till at the seventh or eighth mile she descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of evershead where in the morning she had breakfasted with such contrasting expectations
the cottage by the church in which she again sat down was almost the first at that end of the village and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry tess looking down the street perceived that the place seemed quite deserted
the people are gone to afternoon service i suppose
she said
no my dear said the old woman
'tis too soon for that the bells hain't strook out yet
they be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn
a ranter preaches there between the servicesan excellent fiery christian man they say
but lord i don't go to hear'n
what comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for i
tess soon went onward into the village her footsteps echoing against the houses as though it were a place of the dead
nearing the central part her echoes were intruded on by other sounds and seeing the barn not far off the road she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher
his voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences though she was on the closed side of the barn
the sermon as might be expected was of the extremest antinomian type on justification by faith as expounded in the theology of st paul
this fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm in a manner entirely declamatory for he had plainly no skill as a dialectician
although tess had not heard the beginning of the address she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration      o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye    should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ    hath been evidently set forth crucified among you
tess was all the more interested as she stood listening behind in finding that the preacher's doctrine was a vehement form of the view of angel's father and her interest intensified when the speaker began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views
he had he said been the greatest of sinners
he had scoffed he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd
but a day of awakening had come and in a human sense it had been brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman whom he had at first grossly insulted but whose parting words had sunk into his heart and had remained there till by the grace of heaven they had worked this change in him and made him what they saw him
but more startling to tess than the doctrine had been the voice which impossible as it seemed was precisely that of alec d'urberville
her face fixed in painful suspense she came round to the front of the barn and passed before it
the low winter sun beamed directly upon the great doubledoored entrance on this side one of the doors being open so that the rays stretched far in over the threshingfloor to the preacher and his audience all snugly sheltered from the northern breeze
the listeners were entirely villagers among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the red paintpot on a former memorable occasion
but her attention was given to the central figure who stood upon some sacks of corn facing the people and the door
the three o'clock sun shone full upon him and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer confronted her which had been gaining ground in tess ever since she had heard his words distinctly was at last established as a fact indeed
end of phase the fifth      phase the sixth the convert    xlv   till this moment she had never seen or heard from d'urberville since her departure from trantridge
the rencounter came at a heavy moment one of all moments calculated to permit its impact with the least emotional shock
but such was unreasoning memory that though he stood there openly and palpably a converted man who was sorrowing for his past irregularities a fear overcame her paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated nor advanced
to think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last and to behold it now

there was the same handsome unpleasantness of mien but now he wore neatly trimmed oldfashioned whiskers the sable moustache having disappeared and his dress was halfclerical a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract the dandyism from his features and to hinder for a second her belief in his identity
to tess's sense there was just at first a ghastly bizarrerie a grim incongruity in the march of these solemn words of scripture out of such a mouth
this too familiar intonation less than four years earlier had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the contrast
it was less a reform than a transfiguration
the former curves of sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion
the lipshapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express supplication the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated as riotousness was evangelized today into the splendour of pious rhetoric animalism had become fanaticism paganism paulinism the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was almost ferocious
those black angularities which his face had used to put on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his wallowing in the mire
the lineaments as such seemed to complain
they had been diverted from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which nature did not intend them
strange that their very elevation was a misapplication that to raise seemed to falsify
yet could it be so
she would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer
d'urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive and why should she deem it unnatural in him
it was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes
the greater the sinner the greater the saint it was not necessary to dive far into christian history to discover that
such impressions as these moved her vaguely and without strict definiteness
as soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir her impulse was to pass on out of his sight
he had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun
but the moment that she moved again he recognized her
the effect upon her old lover was electric far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her
his fire the tumultuous ring of his eloquence seemed to go out of him
his lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him
his eyes after their first glance upon her face hung confusedly in every other direction but hers but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds
this paralysis lasted however but a short time for tess's energies returned with the atrophy of his and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward
as soon as she could reflect it appalled her this change in their relative platforms
he who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the spirit while she remained unregenerate
and as in the legend it had resulted that her cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished
she went on without turning her head
her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beamseven her clothingso alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn
all the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow now there was a change in the quality of its trouble
that hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her
it intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence which she had hoped for had not after all taken place
bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself
thus absorbed she recrossed the northern part of longash lane at right angles and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay
its dry pale surface stretched severely onward unbroken by a single figure vehicle or mark save some occasional brown horsedroppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there
while slowly breasting this ascent tess became conscious of footsteps behind her and turning she saw approaching that wellknown formso strangely accoutred as the methodistthe one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave
there was not much time however for thought or elusion and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her
she saw that he was excited less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him
tess
he said
she slackened speed without looking round
tess
he repeated
it is ialec d'urberville
she then looked back at him and he came up
i see it is she answered coldly
wellis that all
yet i deserve no more
of course he added with a slight laugh there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this
buti must put up with that

i heard you had gone away nobody knew where
tess you wonder why i have followed you
i do rather and i would that you had not with all my heart
yesyou may well say it he returned grimly as they moved onward together she with unwilling tread
but don't mistake me i beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticingif you did notice ithow your sudden appearance unnerved me down there
it was but a momentary faltering and considering what you have been to me it was natural enough
but will helped me through itthough perhaps you think me a humbug for saying itand immediately afterwards i felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to comesneer if you likethe woman whom i had so grievously wronged was that person
i have come with that sole purpose in viewnothing more
there was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder have you saved yourself
charity begins at home they say
i have done nothing
said he indifferently
heaven as i have been telling my hearers has done all
no amount of contempt that you can pour upon me tess will equal what i have poured upon myselfthe old adam of my former years
well it is a strange story believe it or not but i can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about and i hope you will be interested enough at least to listen
have you ever heard the name of the parson of emminsteryou must have done doold mr clare one of the most earnest of his school one of the few intense men left in the church not so intense as the extreme wing of christian believers with which i have thrown in my lot but quite an exception among the established clergy the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries till they are but the shadow of what they were
i only differ from him on the question of church and statethe interpretation of the text 'come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord'that's all
he is one who i firmly believe has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name
you have heard of him
i have she said
he came to trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society and i wretched fellow that i was insulted him when in his disinterestedness he tried to reason with me and show me the way
he did not resent my conduct he simply said that some day i should receive the firstfruits of the spiritthat those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray
there was a strange magic in his words
they sank into my mind
but the loss of my mother hit me most and by degrees i was brought to see daylight
since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others and that is what i was trying to do today though it is only lately that i have preached hereabout
the first months of my ministry have been spent in the north of england among strangers where i preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of one's sincerity addressing those who have known one and have been one's companions in the days of darkness
if you could only know tess the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself i am sure  don't go on with it
she cried passionately as she turned away from him to a stile by the wayside on which she bent herself
i can't believe in such sudden things
i feel indignant with you for talking to me like this when you knowwhen you know what harm you've done me
you and those like you take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow and then it is a fine thing when you have had enough of that to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted
out upon suchi don't believe in youi hate it
tess he insisted don't speak so
it came to me like a jolly new idea
and you don't believe me
what don't you believe
your conversion
your scheme of religion
why
she dropped her voice
because a better man than you does not believe in such
what a woman's reason
who is this better man
i cannot tell you
well he declared a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moment's notice god forbid that i should say i am a good manand you know i don't say any such thing
i am new to goodness truly but newcomers see furthest sometimes
yes she replied sadly
but i cannot believe in your conversion to a new spirit
such flashes as you feel alec i fear don't last
thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been leaning and faced him whereupon his eyes falling casually upon the familiar countenance and form remained contemplating her
the inferior man was quiet in him now but it was surely not extracted nor even entirely subdued
don't look at me like that
he said abruptly
tess who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes stammering with a flush i beg your pardon
and there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong
no no
don't beg my pardon
but since you wear a veil to hide your good looks why don't you keep it down
she pulled down the veil saying hastily it was mostly to keep off the wind
it may seem harsh of me to dictate like this he went on but it is better that i should not look too often on you
it might be dangerous
ssh
said tess
well women's faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them
an evangelist has nothing to do with such as they and it reminds me of the old times that i would forget
after this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then as they rambled onward tess inwardly wondering how far he was going with her and not liking to send him back by positive mandate
frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon in red or blue letters some text of scripture and she asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements
he told her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working with him in that district to paint these reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation
at length the road touched the spot called crossinhand
of all spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn
it was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by artists and viewlovers as to reach a new kind of beauty a negative beauty of tragic tone
the place took its name from a stone pillar which stood there a strange rude monolith from a stratum unknown in any local quarry on which was roughly carved a human hand
differing accounts were given of its history and purport
some authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon of which the present relic was but the stump others that the stone as it stood was entire and that it had been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting
anyhow whatever the origin of the relic there was and is something sinister or solemn according to mood in the scene amid which it stands something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passerby
i think i must leave you now he remarked as they drew near to this spot
i have to preach at abbot'scernel at six this evening and my way lies across to the right from here
and you upset me somewhat too tessyi cannot will not say why
i must go away and get strength
  how is it that you speak so fluently now
who has taught you such good english
i have learnt things in my troubles she said evasively
what troubles have you had
she told him of the first onethe only one that related to him
d'urberville was struck mute
i knew nothing of this till now
he next murmured
why didn't you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on
she did not reply and he broke the silence by adding wellyou will see me again
no she answered
do not again come near me
i will think
but before we part come here
he stepped up to the pillar
this was once a holy cross
relics are not in my creed but i fear you at momentsfar more than you need fear me at present and to lessen my fear put your hand upon that stone hand and swear that you will never tempt meby your charms or ways
good godhow can you ask what is so unnecessary
all that is furthest from my thought
yesbut swear it
tess half frightened gave way to his importunity placed her hand upon the stone and swore
i am sorry you are not a believer he continued that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind
but no more now
at home at least i can pray for you and i will and who knows what may not happen
i'm off
goodbye
he turned to a huntinggate in the hedge and without letting his eyes again rest upon her leapt over and struck out across the down in the direction of abbot'scernel
as he walked his pace showed perturbation and byandby as if instigated by a former thought he drew from his pocket a small book between the leaves of which was folded a letter worn and soiled as from much rereading
d'urberville opened the letter
it was dated several months before this time and was signed by parson clare
the letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at d'urberville's conversion and thanked him for his kindness in communicating with the parson on the subject
it expressed mr clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'urberville's former conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future
he mr clare would much have liked to see d'urberville in the church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance
every man must work as he could best work and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the spirit
d'urberville read and reread this letter and seemed to quiz himself cynically
he also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm and apparently the image of tess no longer troubled his mind
she meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home
within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd
what is the meaning of that old stone i have passed
she asked of him
was it ever a holy cross
crossno 'twer not a cross
'tis a thing of illomen miss
it was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung
the bones lie underneath
they say he sold his soul to the devil and that he walks at times
she felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information and left the solitary man behind her
it was dusk when she drew near to flintcombash and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her
they were talking no secrets and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman in response to the warmer accents of the man spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded
for a moment the voices cheered the heart of tess till she reasoned that this interview had its origin on one side or the other in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation
when she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her the young man walking off in embarrassment
the woman was izz huett whose interest in tess's excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings
tess did not explain very clearly its results and izz who was a girl of tact began to speak of her own little affair a phase of which tess had just witnessed
he is amby seedling the chap who used to sometimes come and help at talbothays she explained indifferently
he actually inquired and found out that i had come here and has followed me
he says he's been in love wi' me these two years
but i've hardly answered him
xlvi   several days had passed since her futile journey and tess was afield
the dry winter wind still blew but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her
on the sheltered side was a turnipslicing machine whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene
opposite its front was a long mound or grave in which the roots had been preserved since early winter
tess was standing at the uncovered end chopping off with a billhook the fibres and earth from each root and throwing it after the operation into the slicer
a man was turning the handle of the machine and from its trough came the newlycut swedes the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind the smart swish of the slicingblades and the choppings of the hook in tess's leathergloved hand
the wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness apparent where the swedes had been pulled was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown gradually broadening to ribands
along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field it was two horses and a man the plough going between them turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing
for hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things
then far beyond the ploughingteams a black speck was seen
it had come from the corner of a fence where there was a gap and its tendency was up the incline towards the swedecutters
from the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin and was soon perceived to be a man in black arriving from the direction of flintcombash
the man at the slicer having nothing else to do with his eyes continually observed the comer but tess who was occupied did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach
it was not her hard taskmaster farmer groby it was one in a semiclerical costume who now represented what had once been the freeandeasy alec d'urberville
not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him
a pale distress was already on tess's face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it
d'urberville came up and said quietly  i want to speak to you tess
you have refused my last request not to come near me
said she
yes but i have a good reason
well tell it
it is more serious than you may think
he glanced round to see if he were overheard
they were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer and the movement of the machine too sufficiently prevented alec's words reaching other ears
d'urberville placed himself so as to screen tess from the labourer turning his back to the latter
it is this he continued with capricious compunction
in thinking of your soul and mine when we last met i neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition
you were well dressed and i did not think of it
but i see now that it is hardharder than it used to be when iknew youharder than you deserve
perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me
she did not answer and he watched her inquiringly as with bent head her face completely screened by the hood she resumed her trimming of the swedes
by going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions
tess he added with a sigh of discontentyours was the very worst case i ever was concerned in
i had no idea of what had resulted till you told me
scamp that i was to foul that innocent life
the whole blame was minethe whole unconventional business of our time at trantridge
you too the real blood of which i am but the base imitation what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities
i say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference
tess still did no more than listen throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her
but it is not that i came to say d'urberville went on
my circumstances are these
i have lost my mother since you were at trantridge and the place is my own
but i intend to sell it and devote myself to missionary work in africa
a devil of a poor hand i shall make at the trade no doubt
however what i want to ask you is will you put it in my power to do my dutyto make the only reparation i can make for the trick played you that is will you be my wife and go with me

i have already obtained this precious document
it was my old mother's dying wish
he drew a piece of parchment from his pocket with a slight fumbling of embarrassment
what is it
said she
a marriage licence
o no sirno
she said quickly starting back
you will not
why is that
and as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d'urberville's face
it was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had been revived duty and desire ran handinhand
surely he began again in more impetuous tones and then looked round at the labourer who turned the slicer
tess too felt that the argument could not be ended there
informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her with whom she wished to walk a little way she moved off with d'urberville across the zebrastriped field
when they reached the first newlyploughed section he held out his hand to help her over it but she stepped forward on the summits of the earthrolls as if she did not see him
you will not marry me tess and make me a selfrespecting man
he repeated as soon as they were over the furrows
i cannot
but why
you know i have no affection for you
but you would get to feel that in time perhapsas soon as you really could forgive me
never
why so positive
i love somebody else
the words seemed to astonish him
you do
he cried
somebody else
but has not a sense of what is morally right and proper any weight with you
no no nodon't say that
anyhow then your love for this other man may be only a passing feeling which you will overcome  nono
yes yes
why not
i cannot tell you
you must in honour
well then 
i have married him
ah
he exclaimed and he stopped dead and gazed at her
i did not wish to telli did not mean to
she pleaded
it is a secret here or at any rate but dimly known
so will you please will you keep from questioning me
you must remember that we are now strangers
strangersare we
strangers
for a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face but he determinedly chastened it down
is that man your husband
he asked mechanically denoting by a sign the labourer who turned the machine
that man
she said proudly
i should think not
who then
do not ask what i do not wish to tell
she begged and flashed her appeal to him from her upturned face and lashshadowed eyes
d'urberville was disturbed
but i only asked for your sake
he retorted hotly
angels of heavengod forgive me for such an expressioni came here i swear as i thought for your good
tessdon't look at me soi cannot stand your looks
there never were such eyes surely before christianity or since
therei won't lose my head i dare not
i own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you which i believed was extinguished with all such feelings
but i thought that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both
'the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband' i said to myself
but my plan is dashed from me and i must bear the disappointment
he moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground
married
married
  well that being so he added quite calmly tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket that being prevented i should like to do some good to you and your husband whoever he may be
there are many questions that i am tempted to ask but i will not do so of course in opposition to your wishes
though if i could know your husband i might more easily benefit him and you
is he on this farm
no she murmured
he is far away
far away
from you
what sort of husband can he be
o do not speak against him
it was through you
he found out  ah is it so
  that's sad tess
yes
but to stay away from youto leave you to work like this
he does not leave me to work
she cried springing to the defence of the absent one with all her fervour
he don't know it
it is by my own arrangement
then does he write
ii cannot tell you
there are things which are private to ourselves
of course that means that he does not
you are a deserted wife my fair tess  in an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand the buffglove was on it and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not express the life or shape of those within
you must notyou must not
she cried fearfully slipping her hand from the glove as from a pocket and leaving it in his grasp
o will you go awayfor the sake of me and my husbandgo in the name of your own christianity
yes yes i will he said abruptly and thrusting the glove back to her he turned to leave
facing round however he said tess as god is my judge i meant no humbug in taking your hand
a pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field which they had not noticed in their preoccupation ceased close behind them and a voice reached her ear  what the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o' day
farmer groby had espied the two figures from the distance and had inquisitively ridden across to learn what was their business in his field
don't speak like that to her
said d'urberville his face blackening with something that was not christianity
indeed mister
and what mid methodist pa'sons have to do with she
who is the fellow
asked d'urberville turning to tess
she went close up to him
goi do beg you
she said
what
and leave you to that tyrant
i can see in his face what a churl he is
he won't hurt me
he's not in love with me
i can leave at ladyday
well i have no right but to obey i suppose
butwell goodbye
her defender whom she dreaded more than her assailant having reluctantly disappeared the farmer continued his reprimand which tess took with the greatest coolness that sort of attack being independent of sex
to have as a master this man of stone who would have cuffed her if he had dared was almost a relief after her former experiences
she silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the scene of her labour so absorbed in the interview which had just taken place that she was hardly aware that the nose of groby's horse almost touched her shoulders
if so be you make an agreement to work for me till ladyday i'll see that you carry it out he growled
'od rot the womennow 'tis one thing and then 'tis another
but i'll put up with it no longer
knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received she did for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied alec's wife
it would have lifted her completely out of subjection not only to her present oppressive employer but to a whole world who seemed to despise her
but no no
she said breathlessly i could not have married him now
he is so unpleasant to me
that very night she began an appealing letter to clare concealing from him her hardships and assuring him of her undying affection
any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fearalmost a desperationas to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed
but again she did not finish her effusion he had asked izz to go with him and perhaps he did not care for her at all
she put the letter in her box and wondered if it would ever reach angel's hands
after this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough and brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturiststhe day of the candlemas fair
it was at this fair that new engagements were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing ladyday and those of the farming population who thought of changing their places duly attended at the countytown where the fair was held
nearly all the labourers on flintcombash farm intended flight and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country
though tess also meant to leave at the quarterday she was one of the few who did not go to the fair having a vaguelyshaped hope that something would happen to render another outdoor engagement unnecessary
it was a peaceful february day of wonderful softness for the time and one would almost have thought that winter was over
she had hardly finished her dinner when d'urberville's figure darkened the window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger which she had all to herself today
tess jumped up but her visitor had knocked at the door and she could hardly in reason run away
d'urberville's knock his walk up to the door had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when she last saw him
they seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed
she thought that she would not open the door but as there was no sense in that either she arose and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly
he came in saw her and flung himself down into a chair before speaking
tessi couldn't help it
he began desperately as he wiped his heated face which had also a superimposed flush of excitement
i felt that i must call at least to ask how you are
i assure you i had not been thinking of you at all till i saw you that sunday now i cannot get rid of your image try how i may
it is hard that a good woman should do harm to a bad man yet so it is
if you would only pray for me tess
the suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable and yet tess did not pity him
how can i pray for you she said when i am forbidden to believe that the great power who moves the world would alter his plans on my account
you really think that
yes
i have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise
cured
by whom
by my husband if i must tell
ahyour husbandyour husband
how strange it seems
i remember you hinted something of the sort the other day
what do you really believe in these matters tess
he asked
you seem to have no religionperhaps owing to me
but i have
though i don't believe in anything supernatural
d'urberville looked at her with misgiving
then do you think that the line i take is all wrong
a good deal of it
h'mand yet i've felt so sure about it he said uneasily
i believe in the spirit of the sermon on the mount and so did my dear husband
but i don't believe  here she gave her negations
the fact is said d'urberville drily whatever your dear husband believed you accept and whatever he rejected you reject without the least inquiry or reasoning on your own part
that's just like you women
your mind is enslaved to his
ah because he knew everything
said she with a triumphant simplicity of faith in angel clare that the most perfect man could hardly have deserved much less her husband
yes but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another person like that
a pretty fellow he must be to teach you such scepticism
he never forced my judgement
he would never argue on the subject with me
but i looked at it in this way what he believed after inquiring deep into doctrines was much more likely to be right than what i might believe who hadn't looked into doctrines at all
what used he to say
he must have said something
she reflected and with her acute memory for the letter of angel clare's remarks even when she did not comprehend their spirit she recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use when as it occasionally happened he indulged in a species of thinking aloud with her at his side
in delivering it she gave also clare's accent and manner with reverential faithfulness
say that again asked d'urberville who had listened with the greatest attention
she repeated the argument and d'urberville thoughtfully murmured the words after her
anything else
he presently asked
he said at another time something like this and she gave another which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the pedigree ranging from the dictionnaire philosophique to huxley's essays
ahha
how do you remember them
i wanted to believe what he believed though he didn't wish me to and i managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts
i can't say i quite understand that one but i know it is right
h'm
fancy your being able to teach me what you don't know yourself
he fell into thought
and so i threw in my spiritual lot with his she resumed
i didn't wish it to be different
what's good enough for him is good enough for me
does he know that you are as big an infidel as he
noi never told himif i am an infidel
wellyou are better off today that i am tess after all
you don't believe that you ought to preach my doctrine and therefore do no despite to your conscience in abstaining
i do believe i ought to preach it but like the devils i believe and tremble for i suddenly leave off preaching it and give way to my passion for you
how
why he said aridly i have come all the way here to see you today
but i started from home to go to casterbridge fair where i have undertaken to preach the word from a waggon at halfpast two this afternoon and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute
here's the announcement
he drew from his breastpocket a poster whereon was printed the day hour and place of meeting at which he d'urberville would preach the gospel as aforesaid
but how can you get there
said tess looking at the clock
i cannot get there
i have come here
what you have really arranged to preach and  i have arranged to preach and i shall not be thereby reason of my burning desire to see a woman whom i once despisedno by my word and truth i never despised you if i had i should not love you now
why i did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of all you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you saw the situation you did not remain at my pleasure so there was one petticoat in the world for whom i had no contempt and you are she
but you may well despise me now
i thought i worshipped on the mountains but i find i still serve in the groves
ha
ha
o alec d'urberville
what does this mean
what have i done
done
he said with a soulless sneer in the word
nothing intentionally
but you have been the meansthe innocent meansof my backsliding as they call it
i ask myself am i indeed one of those 'servants of corruption' who 'after they have escaped the pollutions of the world are again entangled therein and overcome' whose latter end is worse than their beginning
he laid his hand on her shoulder
tess my girl i was on the way to at least social salvation till i saw you again
he said freakishly shaking her as if she were a child
and why then have you tempted me
i was firm as a man could be till i saw those eyes and that mouth againsurely there never was such a maddening mouth since eve's
his voice sank and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes
you temptress tess you dear damned witch of babyloni could not resist you as soon as i met you again
i couldn't help your seeing me again
said tess recoiling
i know iti repeat that i do not blame you
but the fact remains
when i saw you illused on the farm that day i was nearly mad to think that i had no legal right to protect youthat i could not have it whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly
don't speak against himhe is absent
she cried in much excitement
treat him honourablyhe has never wronged you
o leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name
i willi will he said like a man awakening from a luring dream
i have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at the fairit is the first time i have played such a practical joke
a month ago i should have been horrified at such a possibility
i'll go awayto swearandah can i
to keep away
then suddenly one clasp tessyone
only for old friendship  i am without defence
alec
a good man's honour is in my keeping thinkbe ashamed
pooh
well yesyes
he clenched his lips mortified with himself for his weakness
his eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith
the corpses of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as in a resurrection
he went out indeterminately
though d'urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement today was the simple backsliding of a believer tess's words as echoed from angel clare had made a deep impression upon him and continued to do so after he had left her
he moved on in silence as if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamtof possibility that his position was untenable
reason had had nothing to do with his whimsical conversion which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless man in search of a new sensation and temporarily impressed by his mother's death
the drops of logic tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm served to chill its effervescence to stagnation
he said to himself as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she had handed on to him that clever fellow little thought that by telling her those things he might be paving my way back to her
xlvii   it is the threshing of the last wheatrick at flintcombash farm
the dawn of the march morning is singularly inexpressive and there is nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies
against the twilight rises the trapezoidal top of the stack which has stood forlornly here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather
when izz huett and tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them to which as the light increased there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit
they were busily unhaling the rick that is stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves and while this was in progress izz and tess with the other womenworkers in their whiteybrown pinners stood waiting and shivering farmer groby having insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of the day
close under the eaves of the stack and as yet barely visible was the red tyrant that the women had come to servea timberframed construction with straps and wheels appertaining the threshingmachine which whilst it was going kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves
a little way off there was another indistinct figure this one black with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve
the long chimney running up beside an ashtree and the warmth which radiated from the spot explained without the necessity of much daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the primum mobile of this little world
by the engine stood a dark motionless being a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness in a sort of trance with a heap of coals by his side it was the engineman
the isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a creature from tophet who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness of this region of yellow grain and pale soil with which he had nothing in common to amaze and to discompose its aborigines
what he looked he felt
he was in the agricultural world but not of it
he served fire and smoke these denizens of the fields served vegetation weather frost and sun
he travelled with his engine from farm to farm from county to county for as yet the steam threshingmachine was itinerant in this part of wessex
he spoke in a strange northern accent his thoughts being turned inwards upon himself his eye on his iron charge hardly perceiving the scenes around him and caring for them not at all holding only strictly necessary intercourse with the natives as if some ancient doom compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his plutonic master
the long strap which ran from the drivingwheel of his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tieline between agriculture and him
while they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable repository of force round whose hot blackness the morning air quivered
he had nothing to do with preparatory labour
his fire was waiting incandescent his steam was at high pressure in a few seconds he could make the long strap move at an invisible velocity
beyond its extent the environment might be corn straw or chaos it was all the same to him
if any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he called himself he replied shortly an engineer
the rick was unhaled by full daylight the men then took their places the women mounted and the work began
farmer grobyor as they called him hehad arrived ere this and by his orders tess was placed on the platform of the machine close to the man who fed it her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by izz huett who stood next but on the rick so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum which whisked out every grain in one moment
they were soon in full progress after a preparatory hitch or two which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery
the work sped on till breakfast time when the thresher was stopped for half an hour and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the strawrick which began to grow beside the stack of corn
a hasty lunch was eaten as they stood without leaving their positions and then another couple of hours brought them near to dinnertime the inexorable wheel continuing to spin and the penetrating hum of the thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving wirecage
the old men on the rising strawrick talked of the past days when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barnfloor when everything even to winnowing was effected by handlabour which to their thinking though slow produced better results
those too on the cornrick talked a little but the perspiring ones at the machine including tess could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many words
it was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so severely and began to make her wish that she had never some to flintcombash
the women on the cornrickmarian who was one of them in particularcould stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing but for tess there was no respite for as the drum never stopped the man who fed it could not stop and she who had to supply the man with untied sheaves could not stop either unless marian changed places with her which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of groby's objections that she was too slowhanded for a feeder
for some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty and groby gave as his motive in selecting tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying and both with staying power and this may have been true
the hum of the thresher which prevented speech increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the regular quantity
as tess and the man who fed could never turn their heads she did not know that just before the dinnerhour a person had come silently into the field by the gate and had been standing under a second rick watching the scene and tess in particular
he was dressed in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern and he twirled a gay walkingcane
who is that
said izz huett to marian
she had at first addressed the inquiry to tess but the latter could not hear it
somebody's fancyman i s'pose said marian laconically
i'll lay a guinea he's after tess
o no
'tis a ranter pa'son who's been sniffing after her lately not a dandy like this
wellthis is the same man
the same man as the preacher
but he's quite different
he hev left off his black coat and white neckercher and hev cut off his whiskers but he's the same man for all that
d'ye really think so
then i'll tell her said marian
don't
she'll see him soon enough goodnow
well i don't think it at all right for him to join his preaching to courting a married woman even though her husband mid be abroad and she in a sense a widow
ohhe can do her no harm said izz drily
her mind can no more be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from the hole he's in
lord love 'ee neither courtpaying nor preaching nor the seven thunders themselves can wean a woman when 'twould be better for her that she should be weaned
dinnertime came and the whirling ceased whereupon tess left her post her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine that she could scarcely walk
you ought to het a quart o' drink into 'ee as i've done said marian
you wouldn't look so white then
why souls above us your face is as if you'd been hagrode
it occurred to the goodnatured marian that as tess was so tired her discovery of her visitor's presence might have the bad effect of taking away her appetite and marian was thinking of inducing tess to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came forward and looked up
tess uttered a short little oh
and a moment after she said quickly i shall eat my dinner hereright on the rick
sometimes when they were so far from their cottages they all did this but as there was rather a keen wind going today marian and the rest descended and sat under the strawstack
the newcomer was indeed alec d'urberville the late evangelist despite his changed attire and aspect
it was obvious at a glance that the original weltlust had come back that he had restored himself as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older to the old jaunty slapdash guise under which tess had first known her admirer and cousin socalled
having decided to remain where she was tess sat down among the bundles out of sight of the ground and began her meal till byandby she heard footsteps on the ladder and immediately after alec appeared upon the stacknow an oblong and level platform of sheaves
he strode across them and sat down opposite of her without a word
tess continued to eat her modest dinner a slice of thick pancake which she had brought with her
the other workfolk were by this time all gathered under the rick where the loose straw formed a comfortable retreat
i am here again as you see said d'urberville
why do you trouble me so
she cried reproach flashing from her very fingerends
i trouble you
i think i may ask why do you trouble me
sure i don't trouble you anywhen
you say you don't
but you do
you haunt me
those very eyes that you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago they come to me just as you showed them then in the night and in the day
tess ever since you told me of that child of ours it is just as if my feelings which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you and had all at once gushed through
the religious channel is left dry forthwith and it is you who have done it
she gazed in silence
whatyou have given up your preaching entirely
she asked
she had gathered from angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to despise flash enthusiasm but as a woman she was somewhat appalled
in affected severity d'urberville continued  entirely
i have broken every engagement since that afternoon i was to address the drunkards at casterbridge fair
the deuce only knows what i am thought of by the brethren
ahha
the brethren
no doubt they pray for meweep for me for they are kind people in their way
but what do i care
how could i go on with the thing when i had lost my faith in itit would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind
among them i should have stood like hymenaeus and alexander who were delivered over to satan that they might learn not to blaspheme
what a grand revenge you have taken
i saw you innocent and i deceived you
four years after you find me a christian enthusiast you then work upon me perhaps to my complete perdition
but tess my coz as i used to call you this is only my way of talking and you must not look so horribly concerned
of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and shapely figure
i saw it on the rick before you saw methat tight pinaforething sets it off and that wingbonnetyou fieldgirls should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger
he regarded her silently for a few moments and with a short cynical laugh resumed i believe that if the bachelorapostle whose deputy i thought i was had been tempted by such a pretty face he would have let go the plough for her sake as i do
tess attempted to expostulate but at this juncture all her fluency failed her and without heeding he added  well this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other after all
but to speak seriously tess
d'urberville rose and came nearer reclining sideways amid the sheaves and resting upon his elbow
since i last saw you i have been thinking of what you said that he said
i have come to the conclusion that there does seem rather a want of commonsense in these threadbare old propositions how i could have been so fired by poor parson clare's enthusiasm and have gone so madly to work transcending even him i cannot make out
as for what you said last time on the strength of your wonderful husband's intelligencewhose name you have never told meabout having what they call an ethical system without any dogma i don't see my way to that at all
why you can have the religion of lovingkindness and purity at least if you can't havewhat do you call itdogma
o no
i'm a different sort of fellow from that
if there's nobody to say 'do this and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead do that and if will be a bad thing for you' i can't warm up
hang it i am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if there's nobody to be responsible to and if i were you my dear i wouldn't either
she tried to argue and tell him that he had mixed in his dull brain two matters theology and morals which in the primitive days of mankind had been quite distinct
but owing to angel clare's reticence to her absolute want of training and to her being a vessel of emotions rather than reasons she could not get on
well never mind he resumed
here i am my love as in the old times
not as thennever as then'tis different
she entreated
and there was never warmth with me
o why didn't you keep your faith if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this
because you've knocked it out of me so the evil be upon your sweet head
your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon him
hahai'm awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the same
tess i am more taken with you than ever and i pity you too
for all your closeness i see you are in a bad wayneglected by one who ought to cherish you
she could not get her morsels of food down her throat her lips were dry and she was ready to choke
the voices and laughs of the workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they were a quarter of a mile off
it is cruelty to me
she said
howhow can you treat me to this talk if you care ever so little for me
true true he said wincing a little
i did not come to reproach you for my deeds
i came tess to say that i don't like you to be working like this and i have come on purpose for you
you say you have a husband who is not i
well perhaps you have but i've never seen him and you've not told me his name and altogether he seems rather a mythological personage
however even if you have one i think i am nearer to you than he is
i at any rate try to help you out of trouble but he does not bless his invisible face
the words of the stern prophet hosea that i used to read come back to me
don't you know them tess'and she shall follow after her lover but she shall not overtake him and she shall seek him but shall not find him then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now'
  tess my trap is waiting just under the hill anddarling mine not hisyou know the rest
her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke but she did not answer
you have been the cause of my backsliding he continued stretching his arm towards her waist you should be willing to share it and leave that mule you call husband for ever
one of her leather gloves which she had taken off to eat her skimmercake lay in her lap and without the slightest warning she passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face
it was heavy and thick as a warrior's and it struck him flat on the mouth
fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised
alec fiercely started up from his reclining position
a scarlet oozing appeared where her blow had alighted and in a moment the blood began dropping from his mouth upon the straw
but he soon controlled himself calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his bleeding lips
she too had sprung up but she sank down again
now punish me
she said turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the sparrow's gaze before its captor twists its neck
whip me crush me you need not mind those people under the rick
i shall not cry out
once victim always victimthat's the law
o no no tess he said blandly
i can make full allowance for this
yet you most unjustly forget one thing that i would have married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so
did i not ask you flatly to be my wifehey
answer me
you did
and you cannot be
but remember one thing
his voice hardened as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude and he stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders so that she shook under his grasp
remember my lady i was your master once
i will be your master again
if you are any man's wife you are mine
the threshers now began to stir below
so much for our quarrel he said letting her go
now i shall leave you and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon
you don't know me yet
but i know you
she had not spoken again remaining as if stunned
d'urberville retreated over the sheaves and descended the ladder while the workers below rose and stretched their arms and shook down the beer they had drunk
then the threshingmachine started afresh and amid the renewed rustle of the straw tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession
xlviii   in the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be finished that night since there was a moon by which they could see to work and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the morrow
hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded with even less intermission than usual
it was not till nammettime about three oclock that tess raised her eyes and gave a momentary glance round
she felt but little surprise at seeing that alec d'urberville had come back and was standing under the hedge by the gate
he had seen her lift her eyes and waved his hand urbanely to her while he blew her a kiss
it meant that their quarrel was over
tess looked down again and carefully abstained from gazing in that direction
thus the afternoon dragged on
the wheatrick shrank lower and the strawrick grew higher and the cornsacks were carted away
at six o'clock the wheatrick was about shoulderhigh from the ground
but the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by the insatiable swallower fed by the man and tess through whose two young hands the greater part of them had passed
and the immense stack of straw where in the morning there had been nothing appeared as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton
from the west sky a wrathful shineall that wild march could afford in the way of sunsethad burst forth after the cloudy day flooding the tired and sticky faces of the threshers and dyeing them with a coppery light as also the flapping garments of the women which clung to them like dull flames
a panting ache ran through the rick
the man who fed was weary and tess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt and husks
she still stood at her post her flushed and perspiring face coated with the corndust and her white bonnet embrowned by it
she was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken bodily by its spinning and the decrease of the stack now separated her from marian and izz and prevented their changing duties with her as they had done
the incessant quivering in which every fibre of her frame participated had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in which her arms worked on independently of her consciousness
she hardly knew where she was and did not hear izz huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down
by degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and saucereyed
whenever tess lifted her head she beheld always the great upgrown strawstack with the men in shirtsleeves upon it against the gray north sky in front of it the long red elevator like a jacob's ladder on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw ascended a yellow river running uphill and spouting out on the top of the rick
she knew that alec d'urberville was still on the scene observing her from some point or other though she could not say where
there was an excuse for his remaining for when the threshed rick drew near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done and men unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that performancesporting characters of all descriptions gents with terriers and facetious pipes roughs with sticks and stones
but there was another hour's work before the layer of live rats at the base of the stack would be reached and as the evening light in the direction of the giant's hill by abbot'scernel dissolved away the whitefaced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay towards middleton abbey and shottsford on the other side
for the last hour or two marian had felt uneasy about tess whom she could not get near enough to speak to the other women having kept up their strength by drinking ale and tess having done without it through traditionary dread owing to its results at her home in childhood
but tess still kept going if she could not fill her part she would have to leave and this contingency which she would have regarded with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier had become a terror since d'urberville had begun to hover round her
the sheafpitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that people on the ground could talk to them
to tess's surprise farmer groby came up on the machine to her and said that if she desired to join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer and would send somebody else to take her place
the friend was d'urberville she knew and also that this concession had been granted in obedience to the request of that friend or enemy
she shook her head and toiled on
the time for the ratcatching arrived at last and the hunt began
the creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick till they were all together at the bottom and being now uncovered from their last refuge they ran across the open ground in all directions a loud shriek from the bythistime halftipsy marian informing her companions that one of the rats had invaded her persona terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by various schemes of skirttucking and selfelevation
the rat was at last dislodged and amid the barking of dogs masculine shouts feminine screams oaths stampings and confusion as of pandemonium tess untied her last sheaf the drum slowed the whizzing ceased and she stepped from the machine to the ground
her lover who had only looked on at the ratcatching was promptly at her side
whatafter allmy insulting slap too
said she in an underbreath
she was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength to speak louder
i should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or do he answered in the seductive voice of the trantridge time
how the little limbs tremble
you are as weak as a bled calf you know you are and yet you need have done nothing since i arrived
how could you be so obstinate
however i have told the farmer that he has no right to employ women at steamthreshing
it is not proper work for them and on all the better class of farms it has been given up as he knows very well
i will walk with you as far as your home
o yes she answered with a jaded gait
walk wi' me if you will
i do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o' my state
perhapsperhaps you are a little better and kinder than i have been thinking you were
whatever is meant as kindness i am grateful for whatever is meant in any other way i am angered at
i cannot sense your meaning sometimes
if i cannot legitimize our former relations at least i can assist you
and i will do it with much more regard for your feelings than i formerly showed
my religious mania or whatever it was is over
but i retain a little good nature i hope i do
now tess by all that's tender and strong between man and woman trust me
i have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety both for yourself and your parents and sisters
i can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me
have you seen 'em lately
she quickly inquired
yes
they didn't know where you were
it was only by chance that i found you here
the cold moon looked aslant upon tess's fagged face between the twigs of the gardenhedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her temporary home d'urberville pausing beside her
don't mention my little brothers and sistersdon't make me break down quite
she said
if you want to help themgod knows they need itdo it without telling me
but no no
she cried
i will take nothing from you either for them or for me
he did not accompany her further since as she lived with the household all was public indoors
no sooner had she herself entered laved herself in a washingtub and shared supper with the family than she fell into thought and withdrawing to the table under the wall by the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood      my own husband     let me call you soi musteven if it makes you angry to    think of such an unworthy wife as i  i must cry to you    in my troublei have no one else
i am so exposed to    temptation angel
i fear to say who it is and i do not    like to write about it at all
but i cling to you in a way    you cannot think
can you not come to me now at once    before anything terrible happens
o i know you cannot    because you are so far away
i think i must die if you do    not come soon or tell me to come to you
the punishment    you have measured out to me is deservedi do know that    well deservedand you are right and just to be angry with    me
but angel please please not to be justonly a    little kind to me even if i do not deserve it and come to    me
if you would come i could die in your arms
i would    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me
angel i live entirely for you
i love you too much to    blame you for going away and i know it was necessary you    should find a farm
do not think i shall say a word of    sting or bitterness
only come back to me
i am desolate    without you my darling o so desolate
i do not mind    having to work but if you will send me one little line    and say i am coming soon i will bide on angelo so    cheerfully
it has been so much my religion ever since we were married    to be faithful to you in every thought and look that even    when a man speaks a compliment to me before i am aware it    seems wronging you
have you never felt one little bit of    what you used to feel when we were at the dairy
if you    have how can you keep away from me
i am the same women    angel as you fell in love with yes the very samenot    the one you disliked but never saw
what was the past to me    as soon as i met you
it was a dead thing altogether
i    became another woman filled full of new life from you
how    could i be the early one
why do you not see this
dear    if you would only be a little more conceited and believe    in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to    work this change in me you would perhaps be in a mind to    come to me your poor wife
how silly i was in my happiness when i thought i could trust    you always to love me
i ought to have known that such as    that was not for poor me
but i am sick at heart not only    for old times but for the present
thinkthink how it do    hurt my heart not to see you everever
ah if i could    only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day    as mine does every day and all day long it might lead you    to show pity to your poor lonely one
people still say that i am rather pretty angel handsome is    the word they use since i wish to be truthful
perhaps i    am what they say
but i do not value my good looks i only    like to have them because they belong to you my dear and    that there may be at least one thing about me worth your    having
so much have i felt this that when i met with    annoyance on account of the same i tied up my face in a    bandage as long as people would believe in it
o angel i    tell you all this not from vanityyou will certainly know    i do notbut only that you may come to me
if you really cannot come to me will you let me come to    you
i am as i say worried pressed to do what i will    not do
it cannot be that i shall yield one inch yet i am    in terror as to what an accident might lead to and i so    defenceless on account of my first error
i cannot say more    about thisit makes me too miserable
but if i break down    by falling into some fearful snare my last state will be    worse than my first
o god i cannot think of it
let me    come at once or at once come to me
i would be content ay glad to live with you as your    servant if i may not as your wife so that i could only be    near you and get glimpses of you and think of you as mine
the daylight has nothing to show me since you are not here    and i don't like to see the rooks and starlings in the    field because i grieve and grieve to miss you who used to    see them with me
i long for only one thing in heaven or    earth or under the earth to meet you my own dear
come    to mecome to me and save me from what threatens me     your faithful heartbroken     tess    xlix   the appeal duly found its way to the breakfasttable of the quiet vicarage to the westward in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at flintcombash and where to tess the human world seemed so different though it was much the same
it was purely for security that she had been requested by angel to send her communications through his father whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart
now said old mr clare to his wife when he had read the envelope if angel proposes leaving rio for a visit home at the end of next month as he told us that he hoped to do i think this may hasten his plans for i believe it to be from his wife
he breathed deeply at the thought of her and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to angel
dear fellow i hope he will get home safely murmured mrs clare
to my dying day i shall feel that he has been illused
you should have sent him to cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had
he would have grown out of it under proper influence and perhaps would have taken orders after all
church or no church it would have been fairer to him
this was the only wail with which mrs clare ever disturbed her husband's peace in respect to their sons
and she did not vent this often for she was as considerate as she was devout and knew that his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter
only too often had she heard him lying awake at night stifling sighs for angel with prayers
but the uncompromising evangelical did not even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his son an unbeliever the same academic advantages that he had given to the two others when it was possible if not probable that those very advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had made it his life's mission and desire to propagate and the mission of his ordained sons likewise
to put with one hand a pedestal under the feet of the two faithful ones and with the other to exalt the unfaithful by the same artificial means he deemed to be alike inconsistent with his convictions his position and his hopes
nevertheless he loved his misnamed angel and in secret mourned over this treatment of him as abraham might have mourned over the doomed isaac while they went up the hill together
his silent selfgenerated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which his wife rendered audible
they blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage
if angel had never been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with agricultural girls
they did not distinctly know what had separated him and his wife nor the date on which the separation had taken place
at first they had supposed it must be something of the nature of a serious aversion
but in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her from which expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly permanent as that
he had told them that she was with her relatives and in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation which they knew no way of bettering
the eyes for which tess's letter was intended were gazing at this time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which was bearing him from the interior of the southamerican continent towards the coast
his experiences of this strange land had been sad
the severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had never wholly left him and he had by degrees almost decided to relinquish his hope of farming here though as long as the bare possibility existed of his remaining he kept this change of view a secret from his parents
the crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country in his wake dazzled by representations of easy independence had suffered died and wasted away
he would see mothers from english farms trudging along with their infants in their arms when the child would be stricken with fever and would die the mother would pause to dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands would bury the babe therein with the same natural gravetools shed one tear and again trudge on
angel's original intention had not been emigration to brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country
he had come to this place in a fit of desperation the brazil movement among the english agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence
during this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years
what arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos
having long discredited the old systems of mysticism he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality
he thought they wanted readjusting
who was the moral man
still more pertinently who was the moral woman
the beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements but in its aims and impulses its true history lay not among things done but among things willed
how then about tess
viewing her in these lights a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him
did he reject her eternally or did he not
he could no longer say that he would always reject her and not to say that was in spirit to accept her now
this growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with her residence at flintcombash but it was before she had felt herself at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her feelings
he was greatly perplexed and in his perplexity as to her motives in withholding intelligence he did not inquire
thus her silence of docility was misinterpreted
how much it really said if he had understoodthat she adhered with literal exactness to orders which he had given and forgotten that despite her natural fearlessness she asserted no rights admitted his judgement to be in every respect the true one and bent her head dumbly thereto
in the beforementioned journey by mules through the interior of the country another man rode beside him
angel's companion was also an englishman bent on the same errand though he came from another part of the island
they were both in a state of mental depression and they spoke of home affairs
confidence begat confidence
with that curious tendency evinced by men more especially when in distant lands to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account mention to friends angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage
the stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more peoples than angel to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm so immense to domesticity were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountainchain to the whole terrestrial curve
he viewed the matter in quite a different light from angel thought that what tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be and plainly told clare that he was wrong in coming away from her
the next day they were drenched in a thunderstorm
angel's companion was struck down with fever and died by the week's end
clare waited a few hours to bury him and then went on his way
the cursory remarks of the largeminded stranger of whom he knew absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name were sublimed by his death and influenced clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the philosophers
his own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast
his inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood
he had persistently elevated hellenic paganism at the expense of christianity yet in that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem
surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the unintact state which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism as at least open to correction when the result was due to treachery
a remorse struck into him
the words of izz huett never quite stilled in his memory came back to him
he had asked izz if she loved him and she had replied in the affirmative
did she love him more than tess did
no she had replied tess would lay down her life for him and she herself could do no more
he thought of tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding
how her eyes had lingered upon him how she had hung upon his words as if they were a god's
and during the terrible evening over the hearth when her simple soul uncovered itself to his how pitiful her face had looked by the rays of the fire in her inability to realize that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn
thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate
cynical things he had uttered to himself about her but no man can be always a cynic and live and he withdrew them
the mistake of expressing them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles to the disregard of the particular instance
but the reasoning is somewhat musty lovers and husbands have gone over the ground before today
clare had been harsh towards her there is no doubt of it
men are too often harsh with women they love or have loved women with men
and yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow the harshness of the position towards the temperament of the means towards the aims of today towards yesterday of hereafter towards today
the historic interest of her familythat masterful line of d'urbervilleswhom he had despised as a spent force touched his sentiments now
why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things
in the latter aspect her d'urberville descent was a fact of great dimensions worthless to economics it was a most useful ingredient to the dreamer to the moralizer on declines and falls
it was a fact that would soon be forgottenthat bit of distinction in poor tess's blood and name and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at kingsbere
so does time ruthlessly destroy his own romances
in recalling her face again and again he thought now that he could see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced her granddames and the vision sent that aura through his veins which he had formerly felt and which left behind it a sense of sickness
despite her notinviolate past what still abode in such a woman as tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows
was not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer
so spoke love renascent preparing the way for tess's devoted outpouring which was then just being forwarded to him by his father though owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in reaching him
meanwhile the writer's expectation that angel would come in response to the entreaty was alternately great and small
what lessened it was that the facts of her life which had led to the parting had not changedcould never change and that if her presence had not attenuated them her absence could not
nevertheless she addressed her mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him best if he should arrive
sighs were expended on the wish that she had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp that she had inquired more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads among those the countrygirls sang
she indirectly inquired of amby seedling who had followed izz from talbothays and by chance amby remembered that amongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the dairyman's to induce the cows to let down their milk clare had seemed to like cupid's gardens i have parks i have hounds and the break o' the day and had seemed not to care for the tailor's breeches and such a beauty i did grow excellent ditties as they were
to perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire
she practised them privately at odd moments especially the break o' the day      arise arise arise
and pick your love a posy    all o' the sweetest flowers    that in the garden grow
the turtle doves and sma' birds    in every bough abuilding    so early in the maytime    at the break o' the day
it would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these ditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this cold dry time the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the thought that perhaps he would not after all come to hear her and the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of the aching heart of the singer
tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know how the season was advancing that the days had lengthened that ladyday was at hand and would soon be followed by old ladyday the end of her term here
but before the quarterday had quite come something happened which made tess think of far different matters
she was at her lodging as usual one evening sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of the family when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for tess
through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child a tall thin girlish creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the girl said tess
whatis it 'lizalu
asked tess in startled accents
her sister whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child had sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation of which as yet lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning
her thin legs visible below her oncelong frock now short by her growing and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience
yes i have been traipsing about all day tess said lu with unemotional gravity atrying to find 'ee and i'm very tired
what is the matter at home
mother is took very bad and the doctor says she's dying and as father is not very well neither and says 'tis wrong for a man of such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work we don't know what to do
tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking 'lizalu to come in and sit down
when she had done so and 'lizalu was having some tea she came to a decision
it was imperative that she should go home
her agreement did not end till old ladyday the sixth of april but as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the risk of starting at once
to go that night would be a gain of twelvehours but her sister was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow
tess ran down to where marian and izz lived informed them of what had happened and begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer
returning she got lu a supper and after that having tucked the younger into her own bed packed up as many of her belongings as would go into a withy basket and started directing lu to follow her next morning
l   she plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck ten for her fifteen miles' walk under the steely stars
in lonely districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless pedestrian and knowing this tess pursued the nearest course along bylanes that she would almost have feared in the daytime but marauders were wanting now and spectral fears were driven out of her mind by thoughts of her mother
thus she proceeded mile after mile ascending and descending till she came to bulbarrow and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born
having already traversed about five miles on the upland she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished
the winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it and soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell
it was the heavy clay land of blackmoor vale and a part of the vale to which turnpikeroads had never penetrated
superstitions linger longest on these heavy soils
having once been forest at this shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character the far and the near being blended and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its presence
the harts that had been hunted here the witches that had been pricked and ducked the greenspangled fairies that whickered at you as you passedthe place teemed with beliefs in them still and they formed an impish multitude now
at nuttlebury she passed the village inn whose sign creaked in response to the greeting of her footsteps which not a human soul heard but herself
under the thatched roofs her mind's eye beheld relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles spread out in the darkness beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares and undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on hambledon hill
at three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had threaded and entered marlott passing the field in which as a clubgirl she had first seen angel clare when he had not danced with her the sense of disappointment remained with her yet
in the direction of her mother's house she saw a light
it came from the bedroom window and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at her
as soon as she could discern the outline of the housenewly thatched with her moneyit had all its old effect upon tess's imagination
part of her body and life it ever seemed to be the slope of its dormers the finish of its gables the broken courses of brick which topped the chimney all had something in common with her personal character
a stupefaction had come into these features to her regard it meant the illness of her mother
she opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody the lower room was vacant but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to the top of the stairs and whispered that mrs durbeyfield was no better though she was sleeping just then
tess prepared herself a breakfast and then took her place as nurse in her mother's chamber
in the morning when she contemplated the children they had all a curiously elongated look although she had been away little more than a year their growth was astounding and the necessity of applying herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares
her father's illhealth was the same indefinite kind and he sat in his chair as usual
but the day after her arrival he was unusually bright
he had a rational scheme for living and tess asked him what it was
i'm thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this part of england he said asking them to subscribe to a fund to maintain me
i'm sure they'd see it as a romantical artistical and proper thing to do
they spend lots o' money in keeping up old ruins and finding the bones o' things and such like and living remains must be more interesting to 'em still if they only knowed of me
would that somebody would go round and tell 'em what there is living among 'em and they thinking nothing of him
if pa'son tringham who discovered me had lived he'd ha' done it i'm sure
tess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled with pressing matters in hand which seemed little improved by her remittances
when indoor necessities had been eased she turned her attention to external things
it was now the season for planting and sowing many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already received their spring tillage but the garden and the allotment of the durbeyfields were behindhand
she found to her dismay that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed potatoesthat last lapse of the improvident
at the earliest moment she obtained what others she could procure and in a few days her father was well enough to see to the garden under tess's persuasive efforts while she herself undertook the allotmentplot which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the village
she liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber where she was not now required by reason of her mother's improvement
violent motion relieved thought
the plot of ground was in a high dry open enclosure where there were forty or fifty such pieces and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended
digging began usually at six o'clock and extended indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight
just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots the dry weather favouring their combustion
one fine day tess and 'lizalu worked on here with their neighbours till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that divided the plots
as soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of the couchgrass and cabbagestalk fires began to light up the allotments fitfully their outlines appearing and disappearing under the dense smoke as wafted by the wind
when a fire glowed banks of smoke blown level along the ground would themselves become illuminated to an opaque lustre screening the workpeople from one another and the meaning of the pillar of a cloud which was a wall by day and a light by night could be understood
as evening thickened some of the gardening men and women gave over for the night but the greater number remained to get their planting done tess being among them though she sent her sister home
it was on one of the couchburning plots that she laboured with her fork its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks
sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire then it would leave her figure free irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap
she was oddly dressed tonight and presented a somewhat staring aspect her attire being a gown bleached by many washings with a short black jacket over it the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one
the women further back wore white aprons which with their pale faces were all that could be seen of them in the gloom except when at moments they caught a flash from the flames
westward the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower sky
above jupiter hung like a fullblown jonquil so bright as almost to throw a shade
a few small nondescript stars were appearing elsewhere
in the distance a dog barked and wheels occasionally rattled along the dry road
still the prongs continued to click assiduously for it was not late and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in it that cheered the workers on
something in the place the hours the crackling fires the fantastic mysteries of light and shade made others as well as tess enjoy being there
nightfall which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover came as a tranquillizer on this march day
nobody looked at his or her companions
the eyes of all were on the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires
hence as tess stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a hope that clare would ever hear them she did not for a long time notice the person who worked nearest to hera man in a long smockfrock who she found was forking the same plot as herself and whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work
she became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer
sometimes the smoke divided them then it swerved and the two were visible to each other but divided from all the rest
tess did not speak to her fellowworker nor did he speak to her
nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been there when it was broad daylight and that she did not know him as any one of the marlott labourers which was no wonder her absences having been so long and frequent of late years
byandby he dug so close to her that the firebeams were reflected as distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own
on going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it she found that he did the same on the other side
the fire flared up and she beheld the face of d'urberville
the unexpectedness of his presence the grotesqueness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock such as was now worn only by the most oldfashioned of the labourers had a ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing
d'urberville emitted a low long laugh
if i were inclined to joke i should say how much this seems like paradise
he remarked whimsically looking at her with an inclined head
what do you say
she weakly asked
a jester might say this is just like paradise
you are eve and i am the old other one come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal
i used to be quite up in that scene of milton's when i was theological
some of it goes      'empress the way is ready and not long    beyond a row of myrtles    
if thou accept    my conduct i can bring thee thither soon'
'lead then' said eve
and so on
my dear tess i am only putting this to you as a thing that you might have supposed or said quite untruly because you think so badly of me
i never said you were satan or thought it
i don't think of you in that way at all
my thoughts of you are quite cold except when you affront me
what did you come digging here entirely because of me
entirely
to see you nothing more
the smockfrock which i saw hanging for sale as i came along was an afterthought that i mightn't be noticed
i come to protest against your working like this
but i like doing itit is for my father
your engagement at the other place is ended
yes
where are you going to next
to join your dear husband
she could not bear the humiliating reminder
oi don't know
she said bitterly
i have no husband
it is quite truein the sense you mean
but you have a friend and i have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself
when you get down to your house you will see what i have sent there for you
o alec i wish you wouldn't give me anything at all
i cannot take it from you
i don't likeit is not right
it is right
he cried lightly
i am not going to see a woman whom i feel so tenderly for as i do for you in trouble without trying to help her
but i am very well off
i am only in trouble aboutaboutnot about living at all
she turned and desperately resumed her digging tears dripping upon the forkhandle and upon the clods
about the childrenyour brothers and sisters he resumed
i've been thinking of them
tess's heart quiveredhe was touching her in a weak place
he had divined her chief anxiety
since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate
if your mother does not recover somebody ought to do something for them since your father will not be able to do much i suppose
he can with my assistance
he must
and with mine
no sir
how damned foolish this is
burst out d'urberville
why he thinks we are the same family and will be quite satisfied
he don't
i've undeceived him
the more fool you
d'urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him and rolling it up and pushing it into the couchfire went away
tess could not get on with her digging after this she felt restless she wondered if he had gone back to her father's house and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards
some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters
o tessywhat do you think
'lizalu is acrying and there's a lot of folk in the house and mother is a good deal better but they think father is dead
the child realized the grandeur of the news but not as yet its sadness and stood looking at tess with roundeyed importance till beholding the effect produced upon her she said  what tess shan't we talk to father never no more
but father was only a little bit ill
exclaimed tess distractedly
'lizalu came up
he dropped down just now and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him because his heart was growed in
yes the durbeyfield couple had changed places the dying one was out of danger and the indisposed one was dead
the news meant even more than it sounded
her father's life had a value apart from his personal achievements or perhaps it would not have had much
it was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held under a lease and it had long been coveted by the tenantfarmer for his regular labourers who were stinted in cottage accommodation
moreover liviers were disapproved of in villages almost as much as little freeholders because of their independence of manner and when a lease determined it was never renewed
thus the durbeyfields once d'urbervilles saw descending upon them the destiny which no doubt when they were among the olympians of the county they had caused to descend many a time and severely enough upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were now
so do flux and refluxthe rhythm of changealternate and persist in everything under the sky
li   at length it was the eve of old ladyday and the agricultural world was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular date of the year
it is a day of fulfilment agreements for outdoor service during the ensuing year entered into at candlemas are to be now carried out
the labourersor workfolk as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from withoutwho wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms
these annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here
when tess's mother was a child the majority of the fieldfolk about marlott had remained all their lives on one farm which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch
with the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage
the egypt of one family was the land of promise to the family who saw it from a distance till by residence there it became it turn their egypt also and so they changed and changed
however all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest
a depopulation was also going on
the village had formerly contained side by side with the argicultural labourers an interesting and betterinformed class ranking distinctly above the formerthe class to which tess's father and mother had belongedand including the carpenter the smith the shoemaker the huckster together with nondescript workers other than farmlabourers a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like tess's father or copyholders or occasionally small freeholders
but as the long holdings fell in they were seldom again let to similar tenants and were mostly pulled down if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands
cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour and the banishment of some starved the trade of others who were thus obliged to follow
these families who had formed the backbone of the village life in the past who were the depositaries of the village traditions had to seek refuge in the large centres the process humorously designated by statisticians as the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns being really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery
the cottage accommodation at marlott having been in this manner considerably curtailed by demolitions every house which remained standing was required by the agriculturist for his workpeople
ever since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over tess's life the durbeyfield family whose descent was not credited had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their lease ended if only in the interests of morality
it was indeed quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of temperance soberness or chastity
the father and even the mother had got drunk at times the younger children seldom had gone to church and the eldest daughter had made queer unions
by some means the village had to be kept pure
so on this the first ladyday on which the durbeyfields were expellable the house being roomy was required for a carter with a large family and widow joan her daughters tess and 'lizalu the boy abraham and the younger children had to go elsewhere
on the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky
as it was the last night they would spend in the village which had been their home and birthplace mrs durbeyfield 'lizalu and abraham had gone out to bid some friends goodbye and tess was keeping house till they should return
she was kneeling in the windowbench her face close to the casement where an outer pane of rainwater was sliding down the inner pane of glass
her eyes rested on the web of a spider probably starved long ago which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came and shivered in the slight draught through the casement
tess was reflecting on the position of the household in which she perceived her own evil influence
had she not come home her mother and the children might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants
but she had been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence they had seen her idling in the churchyard restoring as well as she could with a little trowel a baby's obliterated grave
by this means they had found that she was living here again her mother was scolded for harbouring her sharp retorts had ensued from joan who had independently offered to leave at once she had been taken at her word and here was the result
i ought never to have come home said tess to herself bitterly
she was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street
possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly and directed his horse so close to the cottagefront that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall
it was not till he touched the window with his ridingcrop that she observed him
the rain had nearly ceased and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture
didn't you see me
asked d'urberville
i was not attending she said
i heard you i believe though i fancied it was a carriage and horses
i was in a sort of dream
ah
you heard the d'urberville coach perhaps
you know the legend i suppose
no
mysomebody was going to tell it me once but didn't
if you are a genuine d'urberville i ought not to tell you either i suppose
as for me i'm a sham one so it doesn't matter
it is rather dismal
it is that this sound of a nonexistent coach can only be heard by one of d'urberville blood and it is held to be of illomen to the one who hears it
it has to do with a murder committed by one of the family centuries ago
now you have begun it finish it
very well
one of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful woman who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her off and in the struggle he killed heror she killed himi forget which
such is one version of the tale
i see that your tubs and buckets are packed
going away aren't you
yes tomorrowold lady day
i heard you were but could hardly believe it it seems so sudden
why is it
father's was the last life on the property and when that dropped we had no further right to stay
though we might perhaps have stayed as weekly tenantsif it had not been for me
what about you
i am not aproper woman
d'urberville's face flushed
what a blasted shame
miserable snobs
may their dirty souls be burnt to cinders
he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment
that's why you are going is it
turned out
we are not turned out exactly but as they said we should have to go soon it was best to go now everybody was moving because there are better chances
where are you going to
kingsbere
we have taken rooms there
mother is so foolish about father's people that she will go there
but your mother's family are not fit for lodgings and in a little hole of a town like that
now why not come to my gardenhouse at trantridge
there are hardly any poultry now since my mother's death but there's the house as you know it and the garden
it can be whitewashed in a day and your mother can live there quite comfortably and i will put the children to a good school
really i ought to do something for you
but we have already taken the rooms at kingsbere
she declared
and we can wait there  waitwhat for
for that nice husband no doubt
now look here tess i know what men are and bearing in mind the grounds of your separation i am quite positive he will never make it up with you
now though i have been your enemy i am your friend even if you won't believe it
come to this cottage of mine
we'll get up a regular colony of fowls and your mother can attend to them excellently and the children can go to school
tess breathed more and more quickly and at length she said  how do i know that you would do all this
your views may changeand thenwe should bemy mother would behomeless again
o nono
i would guarantee you against such as that in writing if necessary
think it over
tess shook her head
but d'urberville persisted she had seldom seen him so determined he would not take a negative
please just tell your mother he said in emphatic tones
it is her business to judgenot yours
i shall get the house swept out and whitened tomorrow morning and fires lit and it will be dry by the evening so that you can come straight there
now mind i shall expect you
tess again shook her head her throat swelling with complicated emotion
she could not look up at d'urberville
i owe you something for the past you know he resumed
and you cured me too of that craze so i am glad  i would rather you had kept the craze so that you had kept the practice which went with it
i am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little
tomorrow i shall expect to hear your mother's goods unloading  give me your hand on it nowdear beautiful tess
with the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur and put his hand in at the halfopen casement
with stormy eyes she pulled the staybar quickly and in doing so caught his arm between the casement and the stone mullion
damnationyou are very cruel
he said snatching out his arm
no noi know you didn't do it on purpose
well i shall expect you or your mother and children at least
i shall not comei have plenty of money
she cried
where
at my fatherinlaw's if i ask for it
if you ask for it
but you won't tess i know you you'll never ask for ityou'll starve first
with these words he rode off
just at the corner of the street he met the man with the paintpot who asked him if he had deserted the brethren
you go to the devil
said d'urberville
tess remained where she was a long while till a sudden rebellious sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the rush of hot tears thither
her husband angel clare himself had like others dealt out hard measure to her surely he had
she had never before admitted such a thought but he had surely
never in her lifeshe could swear it from the bottom of her soulhad she ever intended to do wrong yet these hard judgements had come
whatever her sins they were not sins of intention but of inadvertence and why should she have been punished so persistently
she passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand and scribbled the following lines      o why have you treated me so monstrously angel
i do    not deserve it
i have thought it all over carefully    and i can never never forgive you
you know that i    did not intend to wrong youwhy have you so wronged    me
you are cruel cruel indeed
i will try to forget    you
it is all injustice i have received at your    hands
t  she watched till the postman passed by ran out to him with her epistle and then again took her listless place inside the windowpanes
it was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly
how could he give way to entreaty
the facts had not changed there was no new event to alter his opinion
it grew darker the firelight shining over the room
the two biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother the four smallest their ages ranging from threeandahalf years to eleven all in black frocks were gathered round the hearth babbling their own little subjects
tess at length joined them without lighting a candle
this is the last night that we shall sleep here dears in the house where we were born she said quickly
we ought to think of it oughtn't we
they all became silent with the impressibility of their age they were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had conjured up though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of a new place
tess changed the subject
sing to me dears she said
what shall we sing
anything you know i don't mind
there was a momentary pause it was broken first in one little tentative note then a second voice strengthened it and a third and a fourth chimed in unison with words they had learnt at the sundayschool        here we suffer grief and pain      here we meet to part again        in heaven we part no more
the four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had long ago settled the question and there being no mistake about it felt that further thought was not required
with features strained hard to enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre of the flickering fire the notes of the youngest straying over into the pauses of the rest
tess turned from them and went to the window again
darkness had now fallen without but she put her face to the pane as though to peer into the gloom
it was really to hide her tears
if she could only believe what the children were singing if she were only sure how different all would now be how confidently she would leave them to providence and their future kingdom
but in default of that it behoved her to do something to be their providence for to tess as to not a few millions of others there was ghastly satire in the poet's lines                         not in utter nakedness      but trailing clouds of glory do we come
to her and her like birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to justify and at best could only palliate
in the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall 'lizalu and abraham
mrs durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the door and tess opened it
i see the tracks of a horse outside the window said joan
hev somebody called
no said tess
the children by the fire looked gravely at her and one murmured  why tess the gentleman ahorseback
he didn't call said tess
he spoke to me in passing
who was the gentleman
asked the mother
your husband
no
he'll never never come answered tess in stony hopelessness
then who was it
oh you needn't ask
you've seen him before and so have i
ah
what did he say
said joan curiously
i will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at kingsbere tomorrowevery word
it was not her husband she had said
yet a consciousness that in a physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her more and more
lii   during the small hours of the next morning while it was still dark dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their night's rest by rumbling noises intermittently continuing till daylightnoises as certain to recur in this particular first week of the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same
they were the preliminaries of the general removal the passing of the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination
that this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight the aim of the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by six o'clock when the loading of their movables at once began
but to tess and her mother's household no such anxious farmer sent his team
they were only women they were not regular labourers they were not particularly required anywhere hence they had to hire a waggon at their own expense and got nothing sent gratuitously
it was a relief to tess when she looked out of the window that morning to find that though the weather was windy and louring it did not rain and that the waggon had come
a wet ladyday was a spectre which removing families never forgot damp furniture damp bedding damp clothing accompanied it and left a train of ills
her mother 'lizalu and abraham were also awake but the younger children were let sleep on
the four breakfasted by the thin light and the houseridding was taken in hand
it proceeded with some cheerfulness a friendly neighbour or two assisting
when the large articles of furniture had been packed in position a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding in which joan durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the journey
after loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought these having been unharnessed during the ridding but at length about two o'clock the whole was under way the cookingpot swinging from the axle of the waggon mrs durbeyfield and family at the top the matron having in her lap to prevent injury to its works the head of the clock which at any exceptional lurch of the waggon struck one or oneandahalf in hurt tones
tess and the next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village
they had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous evening and some came to see them off all wishing them well though in their secret hearts hardly expecting welfare possible to such a family harmless as the durbeyfields were to all except themselves
soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil
the day being the sixth of april the durbeyfield waggon met many other waggons with families on the summit of the load which was built on a wellnigh unvarying principle as peculiar probably to the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee
the groundwork of the arrangement was the family dresser which with its shining handles and fingermarks and domestic evidences thick upon it stood importantly in front over the tails of the shafthorses in its erect and natural position like some ark of the covenant that they were bound to carry reverently
some of the households were lively some mournful some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns where in due time the durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers
during the halt tess's eyes fell upon a threepint blue mug which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn
she followed one of the mug's journeys upward and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew
tess went towards the waggon
marian and izz
she cried to the girls for it was they sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged
are you houseridding today like everybody else
they were they said
it had been too rough a life for them at flintcombash and they had come away almost without notice leaving groby to prosecute them if he chose
they told tess their destination and tess told them hers
marian leant over the load and lowered her voice
do you know that the gentleman who follows 'eeyou'll guess who i meancame to ask for 'ee at flintcomb after you had gone
we didn't tell'n where you was knowing you wouldn't wish to see him
ahbut i did see him
tess murmured
he found me
and do he know where you be going
i think so
husband come back
no
she bade her acquaintance goodbyefor the respective carters had now come out from the innand the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions the vehicle whereon sat marian izz and the ploughman's family with whom they had thrown in their lot being brightly painted and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness while the waggon on which mrs durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load one which had known no paint since it was made and drawn by two horses only
the contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one's coming
the distance was greattoo great for a day's journeyand it was with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it
though they had started so early it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called greenhill
while the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves tess looked around
under the hill and just ahead of them was the halfdead townlet of their pilgrimage kingsbere where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness kingsbere the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the d'urbervilles' home since they had resided there for full five hundred years
a man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them and when he beheld the nature of their waggonload he quickened his steps
you be the woman they call mrs durbeyfield i reckon
he said to tess's mother who had descended to walk the remainder of the way
she nodded
though widow of the late sir john d'urberville poor nobleman if i cared for my rights and returning to the domain of his forefathers
oh
well i know nothing about that but if you be mrs durbeyfield i am sent to tell 'ee that the rooms you wanted be let
we didn't know that you was coming till we got your letter this morningwhen 'twas too late
but no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere
the man had noticed the face of tess which had become ashpale at his intelligence
her mother looked hopelessly at fault
what shall we do now tess
she said bitterly
here's a welcome to your ancestors' lands
however let's try further
they moved on into the town and tried with all their might tess remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her mother and 'lizalu made inquiries
at the last return of joan to the vehicle an hour later when her search for accommodation had still been fruitless the driver of the waggon said the goods must be unloaded as the horses were halfdead and he was bound to return part of the way at least that night
very wellunload it here said joan recklessly
i'll get shelter somewhere
the waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall in a spot screened from view and the driver nothing loth soon hauled down the poor heap of household goods
this done she paid him reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby and he moved off and left them only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family
it was a dry night and he guessed that they would come to no harm
tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture
the cold sunlight of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze upon the brass handles of the dresser upon the wickercradle they had all been rocked in and upon the wellrubbed clockcase all of which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never made
round about were deparked hills and slopesnow cut up into little paddocksand the green foundations that showed where the d'urberville mansion once had stood also an outlying stretch of egdon heath that had always belonged to the estate
hard by the aisle of the church called the d'urberville aisle looked on imperturbably
isn't your family vault your own freehold
said tess's mother as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard
why of course 'tis and that's where we will camp girls till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof
now tess and 'liza and abraham you help me
we'll make a nest for these children and then we'll have another look round
tess listlessly lent a hand and in a quarter of an hour the old fourpost bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods and erected under the south wall of the church the part of the building known as the d'urberville aisle beneath which the huge vaults lay
over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window of many lights its date being the fifteenth century
it was called the d'urberville window and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on durbeyfield's old seal and spoon
joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it and put the smaller children inside
if it comes to the worst we can sleep there too for one night she said
but let us try further on and get something for the dears to eat
o tess what's the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen if it leaves us like this
accompanied by 'lizalu and the boy she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet
as soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down
ahi'm looking for you
he said riding up to them
this is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot
it was alec d'urberville
where is tess
he asked
personally joan had no liking for alec
she cursorily signified the direction of the church and went on d'urberville saying that he would see them again in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter of which he had just heard
when they had gone d'urberville rode to the inn and shortly after came out on foot
in the interim tess left with the children inside the bedstead remained talking with them awhile till seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then she walked about the churchyard now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall
the door of the church was unfastened and she entered it for the first time in her life
within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family covering in their dates several centuries
they were canopied altarshaped and plain their carvings being defaced and broken their brasses torn from the matrices the rivetholes remaining like martinholes in a sandcliff
of all the reminders that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct there was none so forcible as this spoliation
she drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed      ostium sepulchri antiquae familiae d'urberville   tess did not read churchlatin like a cardinal but she knew that this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre and that the tall knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside
she musingly turned to withdraw passing near an altartomb the oldest of them all on which was a recumbent figure
in the dusk she had not noticed it before and would hardly have noticed it now but for an odd fancy that the effigy moved
as soon as she drew close to it she discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living person and the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so violent that she was quite overcome and sank down nigh to fainting not however till she had recognized alec d'urberville in the form
he leapt off the slab and supported her
i saw you come in he said smiling and got up there not to interrupt your meditations
a family gathering is it not with these old fellows under us here
listen
he stamped with his heel heavily on the floor whereupon there arose a hollow echo from below
that shook them a bit i'll warrant
he continued
and you thought i was the mere stone reproduction of one of them
but no
the old order changeth
the little finger of the sham d'urberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath now command me
what shall i do
go away
she murmured
i willi'll look for your mother said he blandly
but in passing her he whispered mind this you'll be civil yet
when he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults and said  why am i on the wrong side of this door
in the meantime marian and izz huett had journeyed onward with the chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of canaan the egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning
but the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going
their talk was of angel clare and tess and tess's persistent lover whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly guessed ere this
'tisn't as though she had never known him afore said marian
his having won her once makes all the difference in the world
'twould be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again
mr clare can never be anything to us izz and why should we grudge him to her and not try to mend this quarrel
if he could on'y know what straits she's put to and what's hovering round he might come to take care of his own
could we let him know
they thought of this all the way to their destination but the bustle of reestablishment in their new place took up all their attention then
but when they were settled a month later they heard of clare's approaching return though they had learnt nothing more of tess
upon that agitated anew by their attachment to him yet honourably disposed to her marian uncorked the penny inkbottle they shared and a few lines were concocted between the two girls
honour'd sir     look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do    love you
for she is sore put to by an enemy in the shape    of a friend
sir there is one near her who ought to be    away
a woman should not be try'd beyond her strength    and continual dropping will wear away a stoneay    morea diamond
from two wellwishers   this was addressed to angel clare at the only place they had ever heard him to be connected with emminster vicarage after which they continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same time
end of phase the sixth      phase the seventh fulfilment    liii   it was evening at emminster vicarage
the two customary candles were burning under their green shades in the vicar's study but he had not been sitting there
occasionally he came in stirred the small fire which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring and went out again sometimes pausing at the front door going on to the drawingroom then returning again to the front door
it faced westward and though gloom prevailed inside there was still light enough without to see with distinctness
mrs clare who had been sitting in the drawingroom followed him hither
plenty of time yet said the vicar
he doesn't reach chalknewton till six even if the train should be punctual and ten miles of countryroad five of them in crimmercrock lane are not jogged over in a hurry by our old horse
but he has done it in an hour with us my dear
years ago
thus they passed the minutes each well knowing that this was only waste of breath the one essential being simply to wait
at length there was a slight noise in the lane and the old ponychaise appeared indeed outside the railings
they saw alight therefrom a form which they affected to recognize but would actually have passed by in the street without identifying had he not got out of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person was due
mrs clare rushed through the dark passage to the door and her husband came more slowly after her
the new arrival who was just about to enter saw their anxious faces in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because they confronted the last rays of day but they could only see his shape against the light
o my boy my boyhome again at last
cried mrs clare who cared no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes
what woman indeed among the most faithful adherents of the truth believes the promises and threats of the word in the sense in which she believes in her own children or would not throw her theology to the wind if weighed against their happiness
as soon as they reached the room where the candles were lighted she looked at his face
o it is not angelnot my sonthe angel who went away
she cried in all the irony of sorrow as she turned herself aside
his father too was shocked to see him so reduced was that figure from its former contours by worry and the bad season that clare had experienced in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his first aversion to the mockery of events at home
you could see the skeleton behind the man and almost the ghost behind the skeleton
he matched crivelli's dead christus
his sunken eyepits were of morbid hue and the light in his eyes had waned
the angular hollows and lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his face twenty years before their time
i was ill over there you know he said
i am all right now
as if however to falsify this assertion his legs seemed to give way and he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling
it was only a slight attack of faintness resulting from the tedious day's journey and the excitement of arrival
has any letter come for me lately
he asked
i received the last you sent on by the merest chance and after considerable delay through being inland or i might have come sooner
it was from your wife we supposed
it was
only one other had recently come
they had not sent it on to him knowing he would start for home so soon
he hastily opened the letter produced and was much disturbed to read in tess's handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried scrawl to him
o why have you treated me so monstrously angel
i do    not deserve it
i have thought it all over carefully    and i can never never forgive you
you know that i    did not intend to wrong youwhy have you so wronged    me
you are cruel cruel indeed
i will try to forget    you
it is all injustice i have received at your    hands
t  it is quite true
said angel throwing down the letter
perhaps she will never be reconciled to me
don't angel be so anxious about a mere child of the soil
said his mother
child of the soil
well we all are children of the soil
i wish she were so in the sense you mean but let me now explain to you what i have never explained before that her father is a descendant in the male line of one of the oldest norman houses like a good many others who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages and are dubbed 'sons of the soil'
he soon retired to bed and the next morning feeling exceedingly unwell he remained in his room pondering
the circumstances amid which he had left tess were such that though while on the south of the equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle it had seemed the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment he chose to forgive her now that he had arrived it was not so easy as it had seemed
she was passionate and her present letter showing that her estimate of him had changed under his delaytoo justly changed he sadly ownedmade him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her unannounced in the presence of her parents
supposing that her love had indeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words
clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare tess and her family by sending a line to marlott announcing his return and his hope that she was still living with them there as he had arranged for her to do when he left england
he despatched the inquiry that very day and before the week was out there came a short reply from mrs durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment for it bore no address though to his surprise it was not written from marlott
sir     j write these few lines to say that my daughter is away    from me at present and j am not sure when she will    return but j will let you know as soon as she do
j do not feel at liberty to tell you where she is    temperly biding
j should say that me and my family    have left marlott for some time     yours     j durbeyfield   it was such a relief to clare to learn that tess was at least apparently well that her mother's stiff reticence as to her whereabouts did not long distress him
they were all angry with him evidently
he would wait till mrs durbeyfield could inform him of tess's return which her letter implied to be soon
he deserved no more
his had been a love which alters when it alteration finds
he had undergone some strange experiences in his absence he had seen the virtual faustina in the literal cornelia a spiritual lucretia in a corporeal phryne he had thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to be stoned and of the wife of uriah being made a queen and he had asked himself why he had not judged tess constructively rather than biographically by the will rather than by the deed
a day or two passed while he waited at his father's house for the promised second note from joan durbeyfield and indirectly to recover a little more strength
the strength showed signs of coming back but there was no sign of joan's letter
then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in brazil which tess had written from flintcombash and reread it
the sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them

i must cry to you in my troublei have no one    else

i think i must die if you do not come    soon or tell me to come to you please please    not to be justonly a little kind to me 
if    you would come i could die in your arms
i would    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven    me
 if you will send me one little line and say    i am coming soon i will bide on angelo so    cheerfully
 think how it do hurt my heart not to    see you everever
ah if i could only make your    dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine    does every day and all day long it might lead you to    show pity to your poor lonely one

i would be    content ay glad to live with you as your servant    if i may not as your wife so that i could only be    near you and get glimpses of you and think of you    as mine

i long for only one thing in heaven    or earth or under the earth to meet you my own    dear
come to mecome to me and save me from what    threatens me
clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and severer regard of him but would go and find her immediately
he asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence
his father returned a negative and then for the first time it occurred to angel that her pride had stood in her way and that she had suffered privation
from his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of the separation and their christianity was such that reprobates being their especial care the tenderness towards tess which her blood her simplicity even her poverty had not engendered was instantly excited by her sin
whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to handthe one from marian and izz huett beginning  honour'd sir look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do love you and signed from two wellwishers
liv   in a quarter of an hour clare was leaving the house whence his mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street
he had declined to borrow his father's old mare well knowing of its necessity to the household
he went to the inn where he hired a trap and could hardly wait during the harnessing
in a very few minutes after he was driving up the hill out of the town which three or four months earlier in the year tess had descended with such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes
benvill lane soon stretched before him its hedges and trees purple with buds but he was looking at other things and only recalled himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way
in something less than an hourandahalf he had skirted the south of the king's hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of crossinhand the unholy stone whereon tess had been compelled by alec d'urberville in his whim of reformation to swear the strange oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again
the pale and blasted nettlestems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly in the banks young green nettles of the present spring growing from their roots
thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other hintocks and turning to the right plunged into the bracing calcareous region of flintcombash the address from which she had written to him in one of the letters and which he supposed to be the place of sojourn referred to by her mother
here of course he did not find her and what added to his depression was the discovery that no mrs clare had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by the farmer himself though tess was remembered well enough by her christian name
his name she had obviously never used during their separation and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo of which he now learnt for the first time rather than apply to his father for more funds
from this place they told him tess durbeyfield had gone without due notice to the home of her parents on the other side of blackmoor and it therefore became necessary to find mrs durbeyfield
she had told him she was not now at marlott but had been curiously reticent as to her actual address and the only course was to go to marlott and inquire for it
the farmer who had been so churlish with tess was quite smoothtongued to clare and lent him a horse and man to drive him towards marlott the gig he had arrived in being sent back to emminster for the limit of a day's journey with that horse was reached
clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further distance than to the outskirts of the vale and sending it back with the man who had driven him he put up at an inn and next day entered on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear tess's birth
it was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the gardens and foliage the socalled spring was but winter overlaid with a thin coat of greenness and it was of a parcel with his expectations
the house in which tess had passed the years of her childhood was now inhabited by another family who had never known her
the new residents were in the garden taking as much interest in their own doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the histories of others beside which the histories of these were but as a tale told by an idiot
they walked about the garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behind them talking as though the time when tess lived there were not one whit intenser in story than now
even the spring birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular
on inquiry of these precious innocents to whom even the name of their predecessors was a failing memory clare learned that john durbeyfield was dead that his widow and children had left marlott declaring that they were going to live at kingsbere but instead of doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned
by this time clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain tess and hastened away from its hated presence without once looking back
his way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance
it was as bad as the houseeven worse
he passed on through the churchyard where amongst the new headstones he saw one of a somewhat superior design to the rest
the inscription ran thus     in memory of john durbeyfield rightly d'urberville of   the once powerful family of that name and direct   descendant through an illustrious line from sir pagan   d'urberville one of the knights of the conqueror
died   march th                   how are the mighty fallen
some man apparently the sexton had observed clare standing there and drew nigh
ah sir now that's a man who didn't want to lie here but wished to be carried to kingsbere where his ancestors be
and why didn't they respect his wish
ohno money
bless your soul sir whythere i wouldn't wish to say it everywhere buteven this headstone for all the flourish wrote upon en is not paid for
ah who put it up
the man told the name of a mason in the village and on leaving the churchyard clare called at the mason's house
he found that the statement was true and paid the bill
this done he turned in the direction of the migrants
the distance was too long for a walk but clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place
at shaston however he found he must hire but the way was such that he did not enter joan's place till about seven o'clock in the evening having traversed a distance of over twenty miles since leaving marlott
the village being small he had little difficulty in finding mrs durbeyfield's tenement which was a house in a walled garden remote from the main road where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture as best she could
it was plain that for some reason or other she had not wished him to visit her and he felt his call to be somewhat of an intrusion
she came to the door herself and the light from the evening sky fell upon her face
this was the first time that clare had ever met her but he was too preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman in the garb of a respectable widow
he was obliged to explain that he was tess's husband and his object in coming there and he did it awkwardly enough
i want to see her at once he added
you said you would write to me again but you have not done so
because she've not come home said joan
do you know if she is well
i don't
but you ought to sir said she
i admit it
where is she staying
from the beginning of the interview joan had disclosed her embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek
idon't know exactly where she is staying she answered
she wasbut  where was she
well she is not there now
in her evasiveness she paused again and the younger children had by this time crept to the door where pulling at his mother's skirts the youngest murmured  is this the gentleman who is going to marry tess
he has married her joan whispered
go inside
clare saw her efforts for reticence and asked  do you think tess would wish me to try and find her
if not of course  i don't think she would
are you sure
i am sure she wouldn't
he was turning away and then he thought of tess's tender letter
i am sure she would
he retorted passionately
i know her better than you do
that's very likely sir for i have never really known her
please tell me her address mrs durbeyfield in kindness to a lonely wretched man
tess's mother again restlessly swept her cheek with her vertical hand and seeing that he suffered she at last said is a low voice  she is at sandbourne
ahwhere there
sandbourne has become a large place they say
i don't know more particularly than i have saidsandbourne
for myself i was never there
it was apparent that joan spoke the truth in this and he pressed her no further
are you in want of anything
he said gently
no sir she replied
we are fairly well provided for
without entering the house clare turned away
there was a station three miles ahead and paying off his coachman he walked thither
the last train to sandbourne left shortly after and it bore clare on its wheels
lv   at eleven o'clock that night having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival he walked out into the streets of sandbourne
it was too late to call on or inquire for any one and he reluctantly postponed his purpose till the morning
but he could not retire to rest just yet
this fashionable wateringplace with its eastern and its western stations its piers its groves of pines its promenades and its covered gardens was to angel clare like a fairy place suddenly created by the stroke of a wand and allowed to get a little dusty
an outlying eastern tract of the enormous egdon waste was close at hand yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up
within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the soil was prehistoric every channel an undisturbed british trackway not a sod having been turned there since the days of the caesars
yet the exotic had grown here suddenly as the prophet's gourd and had drawn hither tess
by the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new world in an old one and could discern between the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs chimneys gazebos and towers of the numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed
it was a city of detached mansions a mediterranean loungingplace on the english channel and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was
the sea was near at hand but not intrusive it murmured and he thought it was the pines the pines murmured in precisely the same tones and he thought they were the sea
where could tess possibly be a cottagegirl his young wife amidst all this wealth and fashion
the more he pondered the more was he puzzled
were there any cows to milk here
there certainly were no fields to till
she was most probably engaged to do something in one of these large houses and he sauntered along looking at the chamberwindows and their lights going out one by one and wondered which of them might be hers
conjecture was useless and just after twelve o'clock he entered and went to bed
before putting out his light he reread tess's impassioned letter
sleep however he could notso near her yet so far from herand he continually lifted the windowblind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment
he might almost as well have sat up all night
in the morning he arose at seven and shortly after went out taking the direction of the chief postoffice
at the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery
do you know the address of a mrs clare
asked angel
the postman shook his head
then remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name clare said  of a miss durbeyfield
durbeyfield
this also was strange to the postman addressed
there's visitors coming and going every day as you know sir he said and without the name of the house 'tis impossible to find 'em
one of his comrades hastening out at that moment the name was repeated to him
i know no name of durbeyfield but there is the name of d'urberville at the herons said the second
that's it
cried clare pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation
what place is the herons
a stylish lodginghouse
'tis all lodginghouses here bless 'ee
clare received directions how to find the house and hastened thither arriving with the milkman
the herons though an ordinary villa stood in its own grounds and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings so private was its appearance
if poor tess was a servant here as he feared she would go to the backdoor to that milkman and he was inclined to go thither also
however in his doubts he turned to the front and rang
the hour being early the landlady herself opened the door
clare inquired for teresa d'urberville or durbeyfield
mrs d'urberville
yes
tess then passed as a married woman and he felt glad even though she had not adopted his name
will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her
it is rather early
what name shall i give sir
angel
mr angel
no angel
it is my christian name
she'll understand
i'll see if she is awake
he was shown into the front roomthe diningroomand looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it
obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it
he did not blame her for one moment
soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm
dear me
what will she think of me so altered as i am
he said to himself and the door opened
tess appeared on the thresholdnot at all as he had expected to see herbewilderingly otherwise indeed
her great natural beauty was if not heightened rendered more obvious by her attire
she was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressinggown of graywhite embroidered in halfmourning tints and she wore slippers of the same hue
her neck rose out of a frill of down and her wellremembered cable of darkbrown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulderthe evident result of haste
he had held out his arms but they had fallen again to his side for she had not come forward remaining still in the opening of the doorway
mere yellow skeleton that he was now he felt the contrast between them and thought his appearance distasteful to her
tess
he said huskily can you forgive me for going away
can't youcome to me
how do you get to belike this
it is too late said she her voice sounding hard through the room her eyes shining unnaturally
i did not think rightly of youi did not see you as you were
he continued to plead
i have learnt to since dearest tessy mine
too late too late
she said waving her hand in the impatience of a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour
don't come close to me angel
noyou must not
keep away
but don't you love me my dear wife because i have been so pulled down by illness
you are not so ficklei am come on purpose for youmy mother and father will welcome you now
yeso yes yes
but i say i say it is too late
she seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream who tries to move away but cannot
don't you know alldon't you know it
yet how do you come here if you do not know
i inquired here and there and i found the way
i waited and waited for you she went on her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos
but you did not come
and i wrote to you and you did not come
he kept on saying you would never come any more and that i was a foolish woman
he was very kind to me and to mother and to all of us after father's death
he  i don't understand
he has won me back to him
clare looked at her keenly then gathering her meaning flagged like one plaguestricken and his glance sank it fell on her hands which once rosy were now white and more delicate
she continued  he is upstairs
i hate him now because he told me a liethat you would not come again and you have come
these clothes are what he's put upon me i didn't care what he did wi' me
butwill you go away angel please and never come any more
they stood fixed their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see
both seemed to implore something to shelter them from reality
ahit is my fault
said clare
but he could not get on
speech was as inexpressive as silence
but he had a vague consciousness of one thing though it was not clear to him till later that his original tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him as hersallowing it to drift like a corpse upon the current in a direction dissociated from its living will
a few instants passed and he found that tess was gone
his face grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment and a minute or two after he found himself in the street walking along he did not know whither
lvi   mrs brooks the lady who was the householder at the herons and owner of all the handsome furniture was not a person of an unusually curious turn of mind
she was too deeply materialized poor woman by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon profitandloss to retain much curiousity for its own sake and apart from possible lodgers' pockets
nevertheless the visit of angel clare to her wellpaying tenants mr and mrs d'urberville as she deemed them was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade
tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway without entering the diningroom and mrs brooks who stood within the partlyclosed door of her own sittingroom at the back of the passage could hear fragments of the conversationif conversation it could be calledbetween those two wretched souls
she heard tess reascend the stairs to the first floor and the departure of clare and the closing of the front door behind him
then the door of the room above was shut and mrs brooks knew that tess had reentered her apartment
as the young lady was not fully dressed mrs brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time
she accordingly ascended the stairs softly and stood at the door of the front rooma drawingroom connected with the room immediately behind it which was a bedroom by foldingdoors in the common manner
this first floor containing mrs brooks's best apartments had been taken by the week by the d'urbervilles
the back room was now in silence but from the drawingroom there came sounds
all that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable continually repeated in a low note of moaning as if it came from a soul bound to some ixionian wheel  ooo
then a silence then a heavy sigh and again  ooo
the landlady looked through the keyhole
only a small space of the room inside was visible but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table which was already spread for the meal and also a chair beside
over the seat of the chair tess's face was bowed her posture being a kneeling one in front of it her hands were clasped over her head the skirts of her dressinggown and the embroidery of her nightgown flowed upon the floor behind her and her stockingless feet from which the slippers had fallen protruded upon the carpet
it was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair
then a man's voice from the adjoining bedroom  what's the matter
she did not answer but went on in a tone which was a soliloquy rather than an exclamation and a dirge rather than a soliloquy
mrs brooks could only catch a portion  and then my dear dear husband came home to me  and i did not know it
  and you had used your cruel persuasion upon me  you did not stop using itnoyou did not stop
my little sisters and brothers and my mother's needsthey were the things you moved me by  and you said my husband would never come backnever and you taunted me and said what a simpleton i was to expect him
  and at last i believed you and gave way
  and then he came back
now he is gone
gone a second time and i have lost him now for ever  and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any moreonly hate me
 o yes i have lost him nowagain because ofyou
in writhing with her head on the chair she turned her face towards the door and mrs brooks could see the pain upon it and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks
she continued and he is dyinghe looks as if he is dying
  and my sin will kill him and not kill me
  o you have torn my life all to pieces  made me be what i prayed you in pity not to make me be again
  my own true husband will never nevero godi can't bear thisi cannot
there were more and sharper words from the man then a sudden rustle she had sprung to her feet
mrs brooks thinking that the speaker was coming to rush out of the door hastily retreated down the stairs
she need not have done so however for the door of the sittingroom was not opened
but mrs brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing again and entered her own parlour below
she could hear nothing through the floor although she listened intently and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted breakfast
coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor she took up some sewing waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might take away the breakfast which she meant to do herself to discover what was the matter if possible
overhead as she sat she could now hear the floorboards slightly creak as if some one were walking about and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments against the banisters the opening and the closing of the front door and the form of tess passing to the gate on her way into the street
she was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a welltodo young lady in which she had arrived with the sole addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn
mrs brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell temporary or otherwise between her tenants at the door above
they might have quarrelled or mr d'urberville might still be asleep for he was not an early riser
she went into the back room which was more especially her own apartment and continued her sewing there
the lady lodger did not return nor did the gentleman ring his bell
mrs brooks pondered on the delay and on what probable relation the visitor who had called so early bore to the couple upstairs
in reflecting she leant back in her chair
as she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she had never noticed there before
it was about the size of a wafer when she first observed it but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her hand and then she could perceive that it was red
the oblong white ceiling with this scarlet blot in the midst had the appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts
mrs brooks had strange qualms of misgiving
she got upon the table and touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers
it was damp and she fancied that it was a blood stain
descending from the table she left the parlour and went upstairs intending to enter the room overhead which was the bedchamber at the back of the drawingroom
but nerveless woman as she had now become she could not bring herself to attempt the handle
she listened
the dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat
drip drip drip
mrs brooks hastened downstairs opened the front door and ran into the street
a man she knew one of the workmen employed at an adjoining villa was passing by and she begged him to come in and go upstairs with her she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers
the workman assented and followed her to the landing
she opened the door of the drawingroom and stood back for him to pass in entering herself behind him
the room was empty the breakfasta substantial repast of coffee eggs and a cold hamlay spread upon the table untouched as when she had taken it up excepting that the carvingknife was missing
she asked the man to go through the foldingdoors into the adjoining room
he opened the doors entered a step or two and came back almost instantly with a rigid face
my good god the gentleman in bed is dead
i think he has been hurt with a knifea lot of blood had run down upon the floor
the alarm was soon given and the house which had lately been so quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps a surgeon among the rest
the wound was small but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim who lay on his back pale fixed dead as if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow
in a quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed spread through every street and villa of the popular wateringplace
lvii   meanwhile angel clare had walked automatically along the way by which he had come and entering his hotel sat down over the breakfast staring at nothingness
he went on eating and drinking unconsciously till on a sudden he demanded his bill having paid which he took his dressingbag in his hand the only luggage he had brought with him and went out
at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to hima few words from his mother stating that they were glad to know his address and informing him that his brother cuthbert had proposed to and been accepted by mercy chant
clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station reaching it he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour and more
he sat down to wait and having waited a quarter of an hour felt that he could wait there no longer
broken in heart and numbed he had nothing to hurry for but he wished to get out of a town which had been the scene of such an experience and turned to walk to the first station onward and let the train pick him up there
the highway that he followed was open and at a little distance dipped into a valley across which it could be seen running from edge to edge
he had traversed the greater part of this depression and was climbing the western acclivity when pausing for breath he unconsciously looked back
why he did so he could not say but something seemed to impel him to the act
the tapelike surface of the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see and as he gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective
it was a human figure running
clare waited with a dim sense that somebody was trying to overtake him
the form descending the incline was a woman's yet so entirely was his mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him that even when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire in which he now beheld her
it was not till she was quite close that he could believe her to be tess
i saw youturn away from the stationjust before i got thereand i have been following you all this way
she was so pale so breathless so quivering in every muscle that he did not ask her a single question but seizing her hand and pulling it within his arm he led her along
to avoid meeting any possible wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some firtrees
when they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped and looked at her inquiringly
angel she said as if waiting for this do you know what i have been running after you for
to tell you that i have killed him
a pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke
what
said he thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she was in some delirium
i have done iti don't know how she continued
still i owed it to you and to myself angel
i feared long ago when i struck him on the mouth with my glove that i might do it some day for the trap he set for me in my simple youth and his wrong to you through me
he has come between us and ruined us and now he can never do it any more
i never loved him at all angel as i loved you
you know it don't you
you believe it
you didn't come back to me and i was obliged to go back to him
why did you go awaywhy did youwhen i loved you so
i can't think why you did it
but i don't blame you only angel will you forgive me my sin against you now i have killed him
i thought as i ran along that you would be sure to forgive me now i have done that
it came to me as a shining light that i should get you back that way
i could not bear the loss of you any longeryou don't know how entirely i was unable to bear your not loving me
say you do now dear dear husband say you do now i have killed him
i do love you tesso i doit is all come back
he said tightening his arms round her with fervid pressure
but how do you meanyou have killed him
i mean that i have she murmured in a reverie
what bodily
is he dead
yes
he heard me crying about you and he bitterly taunted me and called you by a foul name and then i did it
my heart could not bear it
he had nagged me about you before
and then i dressed myself and came away to find you
by degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted at least what she said she had done and his horror at her impulse was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself and at the strangeness of its quality which had apparently extinguished her moral sense altogether
unable to realize the gravity of her conduct she seemed at last content and he looked at her as she lay upon his shoulder weeping with happiness and wondered what obscure strain in the d'urberville blood had led to this aberrationif it were an aberration
there momentarily flashed through his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder might have arisen because the d'urbervilles had been known to do these things
as well as his confused and excited ideas could reason he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she spoke her mind had lost its balance and plunged her into this abyss
it was very terrible if true if a temporary hallucination sad
but anyhow here was this deserted wife of his this passionatelyfond woman clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to her but a protector
he saw that for him to be otherwise was not in her mind within the region of the possible
tenderness was absolutely dominant in clare at last
he kissed her endlessly with his white lips and held her hand and said  i will not desert you
i will protect you by every means in my power dearest love whatever you may have done or not have done
they then walked on under the trees tess turning her head every now and then to look at him
worn and unhandsome as he had become it was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance
to her he was as of old all that was perfection personally and mentally
he was still her antinous her apollo even his sickly face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no less than when she first beheld him for was it not the face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely and who had believed in her as pure
with an instinct as to possibilities he did not now as he had intended make for the first station beyond the town but plunged still farther under the firs which here abounded for miles
each clasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed of firneedles thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the consciousness of being together at last with no living soul between them ignoring that there was a corpse
thus they proceeded for several miles till tess arousing herself looked about her and said timidly  are we going anywhere in particular
i don't know dearest
why
i don't know
well we might walk a few miles further and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or otherin a lonely cottage perhaps
can you walk well tessy
o yes
i could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me
upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do
thereupon they quickened their pace avoiding high roads and following obscure paths tending more or less northward
but there was an unpractical vagueness in their movements throughout the day neither one of them seemed to consider any question of effectual escape disguise or long concealment
their every idea was temporary and unforefending like the plans of two children
at midday they drew near to a roadside inn and tess would have entered it with him to get something to eat but he persuaded her to remain among the trees and bushes of this halfwoodland halfmoorland part of the country till he should come back
her clothes were of recent fashion even the ivoryhandled parasol that she carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered and the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle of a tavern
he soon returned with food enough for halfadozen people and two bottles of wineenough to last them for a day or more should any emergency arise
they sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal
between one and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and went on again
i feel strong enough to walk any distance said she
i think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of the country where we can hide for a time and are less likely to be looked for than anywhere near the coast clare remarked
later on when they have forgotten us we can make for some port
she made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly and straight inland they went
though the season was an english may the weather was serenely bright and during the afternoon it was quite warm
through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken them into the depths of the new forest and towards evening turning the corner of a lane they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters this desirable mansion to be let furnished particulars following with directions to apply to some london agents
passing through the gate they could see the house an old brick building of regular design and large accommodation
i know it said clare
it is bramshurst court
you can see that it is shut up and grass is growing on the drive
some of the windows are open said tess
just to air the rooms i suppose
all these rooms empty and we without a roof to our heads
you are getting tired my tess
he said
we'll stop soon
and kissing her sad mouth he again led her onwards
he was growing weary likewise for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen miles and it became necessary to consider what they should do for rest
they looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns and were inclined to approach one of the latter when their hearts failed them and they sheered off
at length their gait dragged and they stood still
could we sleep under the trees
she asked
he thought the season insufficiently advanced
i have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed he said
let us go back towards it again
they retraced their steps but it was half an hour before they stood without the entrancegate as earlier
he then requested her to stay where she was whilst he went to see who was within
she sat down among the bushes within the gate and clare crept towards the house
his absence lasted some considerable time and when he returned tess was wildly anxious not for herself but for him
he had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as caretaker and she only came there on fine days from the hamlet near to open and shut the windows
she would come to shut them at sunset
now we can get in through one of the lower windows and rest there said he
under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front whose shuttered windows like sightless eyeballs excluded the possibility of watchers
the door was reached a few steps further and one of the windows beside it was open
clare clambered in and pulled tess in after him
except the hall the rooms were all in darkness and they ascended the staircase
up here also the shutters were tightly closed the ventilation being perfunctorily done for this day at least by opening the hallwindow in front and an upper window behind
clare unlatched the door of a large chamber felt his way across it and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches
a shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room revealing heavy oldfashioned furniture crimson damask hangings and an enormous fourpost bedstead along the head of which were carved running figures apparently atalanta's race
rest at last
said he setting down his bag and the parcel of viands
they remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to shut the windows as a precaution putting themselves in total darkness by barring the shutters as before lest the woman should open the door of their chamber for any casual reason
between six and seven o'clock she came but did not approach the wing they were in
they heard her close the windows fasten them lock the door and go away
then clare again stole a chink of light from the window and they shared another meal till byandby they were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to disperse
lviii   the night was strangely solemn and still
in the small hours she whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with her in his arms across the froom stream at the imminent risk of both their lives and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey
he had never known of that till now
why didn't you tell me next day
he said
it might have prevented much misunderstanding and woe
don't think of what's past
said she
i am not going to think outside of now
why should we
who knows what tomorrow has in store
but it apparently had no sorrow
the morning was wet and foggy and clare rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the house leaving tess asleep
there was no food on the premises but there was water and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the mansion and fetch tea bread and butter from a shop in a little place two miles beyond as also a small tin kettle and spiritlamp that they might get fire without smoke
his reentry awoke her and they breakfasted on what he had brought
they were indisposed to stir abroad and the day passed and the night following and the next and next till almost without their being aware five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion not a sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness such as it was
the changes of the weather were their only events the birds of the new forest their only company
by tacit consent they hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their weddingday
the gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had been
whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter and go forwards towards southampton or london she showed a strange unwillingness to move
why should we put an end to all that's sweet and lovely
she deprecated
what must come will come
and looking through the shutterchink all is trouble outside there inside here content
he peeped out also
it was quite true within was affection union error forgiven outside was the inexorable
andand she said pressing her cheek against his i fear that what you think of me now may not last
i do not wish to outlive your present feeling for me
i would rather not
i would rather be dead and buried when the time comes for you to despise me so that it may never be known to me that you despised me
i cannot ever despise you
i also hope that
but considering what my life has been i cannot see why any man should sooner or later be able to help despising me  how wickedly mad i was
yet formerly i never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me cry
they remained yet another day
in the night the dull sky cleared and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early
the brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk she decided to open the contiguous mansion immediately and to air it thoroughly on such a day
thus it occurred that having arrived and opened the lower rooms before six o'clock she ascended to the bedchambers and was about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay
at that moment she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within
her slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far and she made for instant retreat then deeming that her hearing might have deceived her she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle
the lock was out of order but a piece of furniture had been moved forward on the inside which prevented her opening the door more than an inch or two
a stream of morning light through the shutterchink fell upon the faces of the pair wrapped in profound slumber tess's lips being parted like a halfopened flower near his cheek
the caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance and with the elegance of tess's gown hanging across a chair her silk stockings beside it the pretty parasol and the other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else that her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement as it seemed
she closed the door and withdrew as softly as she had come to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery
not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when tess woke and then clare
both had a sense that something had disturbed them though they could not say what and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger
as soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutterchink
i think we will leave at once said he
it is a fine day
and i cannot help fancying somebody is about the house
at any rate the woman will be sure to come today
she passively assented and putting the room in order they took up the few articles that belonged to them and departed noiselessly
when they had got into the forest she turned to take a last look at the house
ah happy housegoodbye
she said
my life can only be a question of a few weeks
why should we not have stayed there
don't say it tess
we shall soon get out of this district altogether
we'll continue our course as we've begun it and keep straight north
nobody will think of looking for us there
we shall be looked for at the wessex ports if we are sought at all
when we are in the north we will get to a port and away
having thus persuaded her the plan was pursued and they kept a beeline northward
their long repose at the manorhouse lent them walking power now and towards midday they found that they were approaching the steepled city of melchester which lay directly in their way
he decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the afternoon and push onward under cover of darkness
at dusk clare purchased food as usual and their night march began the boundary between upper and midwessex being crossed about eight o'clock
to walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to tess and she showed her old agility in the performance
the intercepting city ancient melchester they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed them
it was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets lighted fitfully by the few lamps keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps
the graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand but it was lost upon them now
once out of the town they followed the turnpikeroad which after a few miles plunged across an open plain
though the sky was dense with cloud a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little
but the moon had now sunk the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads and the night grew as dark as a cave
however they found their way along keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound which it was easy to do there being no hedge or fence of any kind
all around was open loneliness and black solitude over which a stiff breeze blew
they had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front rising sheer from the grass
they had almost struck themselves against it
what monstrous place is this
said angel
it hums said she
hearken
he listened
the wind playing upon the edifice produced a booming tune like the note of some gigantic onestringed harp
no other sound came from it and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two clare felt the vertical surface of the structure
it seemed to be of solid stone without joint or moulding
carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining
at an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally
they carefully entered beneath and between the surfaces echoed their soft rustle but they seemed to be still out of doors
the place was roofless
tess drew her breath fearfully and angel perplexed said  what can it be
feeling sideways they encountered another towerlike pillar square and uncompromising as the first beyond it another and another
the place was all doors and pillars some connected above by continuous architraves
a very temple of the winds he said
the next pillar was isolated others composed a trilithon others were prostrate their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain
the couple advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst
it is stonehenge
said clare
the heathen temple you mean
yes
older than the centuries older than the d'urbervilles
well what shall we do darling
we may find shelter further on
but tess really tired by this time flung herself upon an oblong slab that lay close at hand and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar
owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day the stone was warm and dry in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass around which had damped her skirts and shoes
i don't want to go any further angel she said stretching out her hand for his
can't we bide here
i fear not
this spot is visible for miles by day although it does not seem so now
one of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts now i think of it
and you used to say at talbothays that i was a heathen
so now i am at home
he knelt down beside her outstretched form and put his lips upon hers
sleepy are you dear
i think you are lying on an altar
i like very much to be here she murmured
it is so solemn and lonelyafter my great happinesswith nothing but the sky above my face
it seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two and i wish there were notexcept 'lizalu
clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter and he flung his overcoat upon her and sat down by her side
angel if anything happens to me will you watch over 'lizalu for my sake
she asked when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars
i will
she is so good and simple and pure
o angeli wish you would marry her if you lose me as you will do shortly
o if you would
if i lose you i lose all
and she is my sisterinlaw
that's nothing dearest
people marry sisterlaws continually about marlott and 'lizalu is so gentle and sweet and she is growing so beautiful
o i could share you with her willingly when we are spirits
if you would train her and teach her angel and bring her up for your own self
  she had all the best of me without the bad of me and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us  well i have said it
i won't mention it again
she ceased and he fell into thought
in the far northeast sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light
the uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot letting in at the earth's edge the coming day against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined
did they sacrifice to god here
asked she
no said he
who to
i believe to the sun
that lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun which will presently rise behind it
this reminds me dear she said
you remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married
but i knew your mind all the same and i thought as you thoughtnot from any reasons of my own but because you thought so
tell me now angel do you think we shall meet again after we are dead
i want to know
he kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time
o angeli fear that means no
said she with a suppressed sob
and i wanted so to see you againso much so much
whatnot even you and i angel who love each other so well
like a greater than himself to the critical question at the critical time he did not answer and they were again silent
in a minute or two her breathing became more regular her clasp of his hand relaxed and she fell asleep
the band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the great plain appear dark and near and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve taciturnity and hesitation which is usual just before day
the eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light and the great flameshaped sunstone beyond them and the stone of sacrifice midway
presently the night wind died out and the quivering little pools in the cuplike hollows of the stones lay still
at the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastwarda mere dot
it was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the sunstone
clare wished they had gone onward but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet
the figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were
he heard something behind him the brush of feet
turning he saw over the prostrate columns another figure then before he was aware another was at hand on the right under a trilithon and another on the left
the dawn shone full on the front of the man westward and clare could discern from this that he was tall and walked as if trained
they all closed in with evident purpose
her story then was true
springing to his feet he looked around for a weapon loose stone means of escape anything
by this time the nearest man was upon him
it is no use sir he said
there are sixteen of us on the plain and the whole country is reared
let her finish her sleep
he implored in a whisper of the men as they gathered round
when they saw where she lay which they had not done till then they showed no objection and stood watching her as still as the pillars around
he went to the stone and bent over her holding one poor little hand her breathing now was quick and small like that of a lesser creature than a woman
all waited in the growing light their faces and hands as if they were silvered the remainder of their figures dark the stones glistening greengray the plain still a mass of shade
soon the light was strong and a ray shone upon her unconscious form peering under her eyelids and waking her
what is it angel
she said starting up
have they come for me
yes dearest he said
they have come
it is as it should be she murmured
angel i am almost gladyes glad
this happiness could not have lasted
it was too much
i have had enough and now i shall not live for you to despise me
she stood up shook herself and went forward neither of the men having moved
i am ready she said quietly
lix   the city of wintoncester that fine old city aforetime capital of wessex lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the brightness and warmth of a july morning
the gabled brick tile and freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen the streams in the meadows were low and in the sloping high street from the west gateway to the medival cross and from the medival cross to the bridge that leisurely dusting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an oldfashioned marketday
from the western gate aforesaid the highway as every wintoncestrian knows ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a measured mile leaving the houses gradually behind
up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly as if unconscious of the trying ascentunconscious through preoccupation and not through buoyancy
they had emerged upon this road through a narrow barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down
they seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind and this road appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so
though they were young they walked with bowed heads which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly
one of the pair was angel clare the other a tall budding creaturehalf girl half womana spiritualized image of tess slighter than she but with the same beautiful eyesclare's sisterinlaw 'lizalu
their pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size
they moved on hand in hand and never spoke a word the drooping of their heads being that of giotto's two apostles
when they had nearly reached the top of the great west hill the clocks in the town struck eight
each gave a start at the notes and walking onward yet a few steps they reached the first milestone standing whitely on the green margin of the grass and backed by the down which here was open to the road
they entered upon the turf and impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their will suddenly stood still turned and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone
the prospect from this summit was almost unlimited
in the valley beneath lay the city they had just left its more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric drawingamong them the broad cathedral tower with its norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave the spires of st thomas's the pinnacled tower of the college and more to the right the tower and gables of the ancient hospice where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale
behind the city swept the rotund upland of st catherine's hill further off landscape beyond landscape till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it
against these far stretches of country rose in front of the other city edifices a large redbrick building with level gray roofs and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the gothic erections
it was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks but it was visible enough up here
the wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this structure
from the middle of the building an ugly flattopped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon and viewed from this spot on its shady side and against the light it seemed the one blot on the city's beauty
yet it was with this blot and not with the beauty that the two gazers were concerned
upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed
their eyes were riveted on it
a few minutes after the hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff and extended itself upon the breeze
it was a black flag
justice was done and the president of the immortals in aeschylean phrase had ended his sport with tess
and the d'urberville knights and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing
the two speechless gazers bent themselves down to the earth as if in prayer and remained thus a long time absolutely motionless the flag continued to wave silently
as soon as they had strength they arose joined hands again and went on
