part i   at the little town of vevey in switzerland there is a particularly comfortable hotel
there are indeed many hotels for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place which as many travelers will remember is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lakea lake that it behooves every tourist to visit
the shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order of every category from the grand hotel of the newest fashion with a chalkwhite front a hundred balconies and a dozen flags flying from its roof to the little swiss pension of an elder day with its name inscribed in germanlooking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden
one of the hotels at vevey however is famous even classical being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity
in this region in the month of june american travelers are extremely numerous it may be said indeed that vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an american watering place
there are sights and sounds which evoke a vision an echo of newport and saratoga
there is a flitting hither and thither of stylish young girls a rustling of muslin flounces a rattle of dance music in the morning hours a sound of highpitched voices at all times
you receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the trois couronnes and are transported in fancy to the ocean house or to congress hall
but at the trois couronnes it must be added there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions neat german waiters who look like secretaries of legation russian princesses sitting in the garden little polish boys walking about held by the hand with their governors a view of the sunny crest of the dent du midi and the picturesque towers of the castle of chillon
i hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young american who two or three years ago sat in the garden of the trois couronnes looking about him rather idly at some of the graceful objects i have mentioned
it was a beautiful summer morning and in whatever fashion the young american looked at things they must have seemed to him charming
he had come from geneva the day before by the little steamer to see his aunt who was staying at the hotelgeneva having been for a long time his place of residence
but his aunt had a headachehis aunt had almost always a headacheand now she was shut up in her room smelling camphor so that he was at liberty to wander about
he was some sevenandtwenty years of age when his friends spoke of him they usually said that he was at geneva studying when his enemies spoke of him they saidbut after all he had no enemies he was an extremely amiable fellow and universally liked
what i should say is simply that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived therea foreign ladya person older than himself
very few americansindeed i think nonehad ever seen this lady about whom there were some singular stories
but winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of calvinism he had been put to school there as a boy and he had afterward gone to college therecircumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships
many of these he had kept and they were a source of great satisfaction to him
after knocking at his aunts door and learning that she was indisposed he had taken a walk about the town and then he had come in to his breakfast
he had now finished his breakfast but he was drinking a small cup of coffee which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache
at last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette
presently a small boy came walking along the pathan urchin of nine or ten
the child who was diminutive for his years had an aged expression of countenance a pale complexion and sharp little features
he was dressed in knickerbockers with red stockings which displayed his poor little spindleshanks he also wore a brilliant red cravat
he carried in his hand a long alpenstock the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approachedthe flowerbeds the garden benches the trains of the ladies dresses
in front of winterbourne he paused looking at him with a pair of bright penetrating little eyes
will you give me a lump of sugar he asked in a sharp hard little voicea voice immature and yet somehow not young
winterbourne glanced at the small table near him on which his coffee service rested and saw that several morsels of sugar remained
yes you may take one he answered but i dont think sugar is good for little boys  this little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers depositing the other as promptly in another place
he poked his alpenstock lancefashion into winterbournes bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth
oh blazes its harrd he exclaimed pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner
winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman
take care you dont hurt your teeth he said paternally
i havent got any teeth to hurt
they have all come out
i have only got seven teeth
my mother counted them last night and one came out right afterward
she said shed slap me if any more came out
i cant help it
its this old europe
its the climate that makes them come out
in america they didnt come out
its these hotels  winterbourne was much amused
if you eat three lumps of sugar your mother will certainly slap you he said
shes got to give me some candy then rejoined his young interlocutor
i cant get any candy hereany american candy
american candys the best candy  and are american little boys the best little boys asked winterbourne
i dont know
im an american boy said the child
i see you are one of the best laughed winterbourne
are you an american man pursued this vivacious infant
and then on winterbournes affirmative replyamerican men are the best he declared
his companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar
winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to europe at about this age
here comes my sister cried the child in a moment
shes an american girl  winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing
american girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion
my sister aint the best the child declared
shes always blowing at me  i imagine that is your fault not hers said winterbourne
the young lady meanwhile had drawn near
she was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of palecolored ribbon
she was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty
how pretty they are thought winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise
the young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake
the little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little
randolph said the young lady what are you doing  im going up the alps replied randolph
this is the way and he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about winterbournes ears
thats the way they come down said winterbourne
hes an american man cried randolph in his little hard voice
the young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother
well i guess you had better be quiet she simply observed
it seemed to winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented
he got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette
this little boy and i have made acquaintance he said with great civility
in geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at vevey what conditions could be better than thesea pretty american girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden
this pretty american girl however on hearing winterbournes observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains
he wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat
while he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again
i should like to know where you got that pole she said
i bought it responded randolph
you dont mean to say youre going to take it to italy  yes i am going to take it to italy the child declared
the young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon
then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again
well i guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment
are you going to italy winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect
the young lady glanced at him again
yes sir she replied
and she said nothing more
are youagoing over the simplon winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed
i dont know she said
i suppose its some mountain
randolph what mountain are we going over  going where the child demanded
to italy winterbourne explained
i dont know said randolph
i dont want to go to italy
i want to go to america  oh italy is a beautiful place rejoined the young man
can you get candy there randolph loudly inquired
i hope not said his sister
i guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too  i havent had any for ever so longfor a hundred weeks cried the boy still jumping about
the young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view
he was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself
there had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered
if she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner
yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking
it was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girls eyes were singularly honest and fresh
they were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywomans various featuresher complexion her nose her ears her teeth
he had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young ladys face he made several observations
it was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate winterbourne mentally accused itvery forgivinglyof a want of finish
he thought it very possible that master randolphs sister was a coquette he was sure she had a spirit of her own but in her bright sweet superficial little visage there was no mockery no irony
before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation
she told him that they were going to rome for the wintershe and her mother and randolph
she asked him if he was a real american she shouldnt have taken him for one he seemed more like a germanthis was said after a little hesitationespecially when he spoke
winterbourne laughing answered that he had met germans who spoke like americans but that he had not so far as he remembered met an american who spoke like a german
then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted
she answered that she liked standing up and walking about but she presently sat down
she told him she was from new york stateif you know where that is winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side
tell me your name my boy he said
randolph c miller said the boy sharply
and ill tell you her name and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister
you had better wait till you are asked said this young lady calmly
i should like very much to know your name said winterbourne
her name is daisy miller cried the child
but that isnt her real name that isnt her name on her cards  its a pity you havent got one of my cards said miss miller
her real name is annie p miller the boy went on
ask him his name said his sister indicating winterbourne
but on this point randolph seemed perfectly indifferent he continued to supply information with regard to his own family
my fathers name is ezra b miller he announced
my father aint in europe my fathers in a better place than europe  winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that mr miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward
but randolph immediately added my fathers in schenectady
hes got a big business
my fathers rich you bet  well ejaculated miss miller lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border
winterbourne presently released the child who departed dragging his alpenstock along the path
he doesnt like europe said the young girl
he wants to go back  to schenectady you mean  yes he wants to go right home
he hasnt got any boys here
there is one boy here but he always goes round with a teacher they wont let him play  and your brother hasnt any teacher winterbourne inquired
mother thought of getting him one to travel round with us
there was a lady told her of a very good teacher an american ladyperhaps you know hermrs sanders
i think she came from boston
she told her of this teacher and we thought of getting him to travel round with us
but randolph said he didnt want a teacher traveling round with us
he said he wouldnt have lessons when he was in the cars
and we are in the cars about half the time
there was an english lady we met in the carsi think her name was miss featherstone perhaps you know her
she wanted to know why i didnt give randolph lessonsgive him instruction she called it
i guess he could give me more instruction than i could give him
hes very smart  yes said winterbourne he seems very smart  mothers going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to italy
can you get good teachers in italy  very good i should think said winterbourne
or else shes going to find some school
he ought to learn some more
hes only nine
hes going to college and in this way miss miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics
she sat there with her extremely pretty hands ornamented with very brilliant rings folded in her lap and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of winterbourne now wandering over the garden the people who passed by and the beautiful view
she talked to winterbourne as if she had known him a long time
he found it very pleasant
it was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much
it might have been said of this unknown young lady who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench that she chattered
she was very quiet she sat in a charming tranquil attitude but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving
she had a soft slender agreeable voice and her tone was decidedly sociable
she gave winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother in europe and enumerated in particular the various hotels at which they had stopped
that english lady in the cars she saidmiss featherstoneasked me if we didnt all live in hotels in america
i told her i had never been in so many hotels in my life as since i came to europe
i have never seen so manyits nothing but hotels but miss miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent she appeared to be in the best humor with everything
she declared that the hotels were very good when once you got used to their ways and that europe was perfectly sweet
she was not disappointednot a bit
perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before
she had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times
and then she had had ever so many dresses and things from paris
whenever she put on a paris dress she felt as if she were in europe
it was a kind of a wishing cap said winterbourne
yes said miss miller without examining this analogy it always made me wish i was here
but i neednt have done that for dresses
i am sure they send all the pretty ones to america you see the most frightful things here
the only thing i dont like she proceeded is the society
there isnt any society or if there is i dont know where it keeps itself
do you
i suppose there is some society somewhere but i havent seen anything of it
im very fond of society and i have always had a great deal of it
i dont mean only in schenectady but in new york
i used to go to new york every winter
in new york i had lots of society
last winter i had seventeen dinners given me and three of them were by gentlemen added daisy miller
i have more friends in new york than in schenectadymore gentleman friends and more young lady friends too she resumed in a moment
she paused again for an instant she was looking at winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light slightly monotonous smile
i have always had she said a great deal of gentlemens society  poor winterbourne was amused perplexed and decidedly charmed
he had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion never at least save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment
and yet was he to accuse miss daisy miller of actual or potential inconduite as they said at geneva
he felt that he had lived at geneva so long that he had lost a good deal he had become dishabituated to the american tone
never indeed since he had grown old enough to appreciate things had he encountered a young american girl of so pronounced a type as this
certainly she was very charming but how deucedly sociable
was she simply a pretty girl from new york state
were they all like that the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemens society
or was she also a designing an audacious an unscrupulous young person
winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter and his reason could not help him
miss daisy miller looked extremely innocent
some people had told him that after all american girls were exceedingly innocent and others had told him that after all they were not
he was inclined to think miss daisy miller was a flirta pretty american flirt
he had never as yet had any relations with young ladies of this category
he had known here in europe two or three womenpersons older than miss daisy miller and provided for respectabilitys sake with husbandswho were great coquettesdangerous terrible women with whom ones relations were liable to take a serious turn
but this young girl was not a coquette in that sense she was very unsophisticated she was only a pretty american flirt
winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to miss daisy miller
he leaned back in his seat he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of ones intercourse with a pretty american flirt
it presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn
have you been to that old castle asked the young girl pointing with her parasol to the fargleaming walls of the chateau de chillon
yes formerly more than once said winterbourne
you too i suppose have seen it  no we havent been there
i want to go there dreadfully
of course i mean to go there
i wouldnt go away from here without having seen that old castle  its a very pretty excursion said winterbourne and very easy to make
you can drive you know or you can go by the little steamer  you can go in the cars said miss miller
yes you can go in the cars winterbourne assented
our courier says they take you right up to the castle the young girl continued
we were going last week but my mother gave out
she suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia
she said she couldnt go
randolph wouldnt go either he says he doesnt think much of old castles
but i guess well go this week if we can get randolph  your brother is not interested in ancient monuments winterbourne inquired smiling
he says he dont care much about old castles
hes only nine
he wants to stay at the hotel
mothers afraid to leave him alone and the courier wont stay with him so we havent been to many places
but it will be too bad if we dont go up there and miss miller pointed again at the chateau de chillon
i should think it might be arranged said winterbourne
couldnt you get some one to stay for the afternoon with randolph  miss miller looked at him a moment and then very placidly i wish you would stay with him she said
winterbourne hesitated a moment
i should much rather go to chillon with you  with me asked the young girl with the same placidity
she didnt rise blushing as a young girl at geneva would have done and yet winterbourne conscious that he had been very bold thought it possible she was offended
with your mother he answered very respectfully
but it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller
i guess my mother wont go after all she said
she dont like to ride round in the afternoon
but did you really mean what you said just nowthat you would like to go up there  most earnestly winterbourne declared
then we may arrange it
if mother will stay with randolph i guess eugenio will  eugenio the young man inquired
eugenios our courier
he doesnt like to stay with randolph hes the most fastidious man i ever saw
but hes a splendid courier
i guess hell stay at home with randolph if mother does and then we can go to the castle  winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possiblewe could only mean miss daisy miller and himself
this program seemed almost too agreeable for credence he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladys hand
possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project but at this moment another person presumably eugenio appeared
a tall handsome man with superb whiskers wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain approached miss miller looking sharply at her companion
oh eugenio said miss miller with the friendliest accent
eugenio had looked at winterbourne from head to foot he now bowed gravely to the young lady
i have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table  miss miller slowly rose
see here eugenio she said im going to that old castle anyway  to the chateau de chillon mademoiselle the courier inquired
mademoiselle has made arrangements he added in a tone which struck winterbourne as very impertinent
eugenios tone apparently threw even to miss millers own apprehension a slightly ironical light upon the young girls situation
she turned to winterbourne blushing a littlea very little
you wont back out  she said
i shall not be happy till we go he protested
and you are staying in this hotel she went on
and you are really an american  the courier stood looking at winterbourne offensively
the young man at least thought his manner of looking an offense to miss miller it conveyed an imputation that she picked up acquaintances
i shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me  he said smiling and referring to his aunt
oh well well go some day said miss miller
and she gave him a smile and turned away
she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio
winterbourne stood looking after her and as she moved away drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess
he had however engaged to do more than proved feasible in promising to present his aunt mrs costello to miss daisy miller
as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache he waited upon her in her apartment and after the proper inquiries in regard to her health he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an american familya mamma a daughter and a little boy
and a courier said mrs costello
oh yes i have observed them
seen themheard themand kept out of their way mrs costello was a widow with a fortune a person of much distinction who frequently intimated that if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time
she had a long pale face a high nose and a great deal of very striking white hair which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head
she had two sons married in new york and another who was now in europe
this young man was amusing himself at hamburg and though he was on his travels was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there
her nephew who had come up to vevey expressly to see her was therefore more attentive than those who as she said were nearer to her
he had imbibed at geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to ones aunt
mrs costello had not seen him for many years and she was greatly pleased with him manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which as she gave him to understand she exerted in the american capital
she admitted that she was very exclusive but if he were acquainted with new york he would see that one had to be
and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city which she presented to him in many different lights was to winterbournes imagination almost oppressively striking
he immediately perceived from her tone that miss daisy millers place in the social scale was low
i am afraid you dont approve of them he said
they are very common mrs costello declared
they are the sort of americans that one does ones duty by notnot accepting  ah you dont accept them said the young man
i cant my dear frederick
i would if i could but i cant  the young girl is very pretty said winterbourne in a moment
of course shes pretty
but she is very common  i see what you mean of course said winterbourne after another pause
she has that charming look that they all have his aunt resumed
i cant think where they pick it up and she dresses in perfectionno you dont know how well she dresses
i cant think where they get their taste  but my dear aunt she is not after all a comanche savage  she is a young lady said mrs costello who has an intimacy with her mammas courier  an intimacy with the courier the young man demanded
oh the mother is just as bad
they treat the courier like a familiar friendlike a gentleman
i shouldnt wonder if he dines with them
very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners such fine clothes so like a gentleman
he probably corresponds to the young ladys idea of a count
he sits with them in the garden in the evening
i think he smokes  winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures they helped him to make up his mind about miss daisy
evidently she was rather wild
well he said i am not a courier and yet she was very charming to me  you had better have said at first said mrs costello with dignity that you had made her acquaintance  we simply met in the garden and we talked a bit  tout bonnement
and pray what did you say  i said i should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt  i am much obliged to you  it was to guarantee my respectability said winterbourne
and pray who is to guarantee hers  ah you are cruel said the young man
shes a very nice young girl  you dont say that as if you believed it mrs costello observed
she is completely uncultivated winterbourne went on
but she is wonderfully pretty and in short she is very nice
to prove that i believe it i am going to take her to the chateau de chillon  you two are going off there together
i should say it proved just the contrary
how long had you known her may i ask when this interesting project was formed
you havent been twentyfour hours in the house  i have known her half an hour said winterbourne smiling
dear me cried mrs costello
what a dreadful girl  her nephew was silent for some moments
you really think then he began earnestly and with a desire for trustworthy informationyou really think that but he paused again
think what sir said his aunt
that she is the sort of young lady who expects a man sooner or later to carry her off  i havent the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do
but i really think that you had better not meddle with little american girls that are uncultivated as you call them
you have lived too long out of the country
you will be sure to make some great mistake
you are too innocent  my dear aunt i am not so innocent said winterbourne smiling and curling his mustache
you are guilty too then  winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively
you wont let the poor girl know you then he asked at last
is it literally true that she is going to the chateau de chillon with you  i think that she fully intends it  then my dear frederick said mrs costello i must decline the honor of her acquaintance
i am an old woman but i am not too old thank heaven to be shocked  but dont they all do these thingsthe young girls in america  winterbourne inquired
mrs costello stared a moment
i should like to see my granddaughters do them she declared grimly
this seemed to throw some light upon the matter for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were tremendous flirts if therefore miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies it was probable that anything might be expected of her
winterbourne was impatient to see her again and he was vexed with himself that by instinct he should not appreciate her justly
though he was impatient to see her he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunts refusal to become acquainted with her but he discovered promptly enough that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe
he found her that evening in the garden wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld
it was ten oclock
he had dined with his aunt had been sitting with her since dinner and had just taken leave of her till the morrow
miss daisy miller seemed very glad to see him she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed
have you been all alone he asked
i have been walking round with mother
but mother gets tired walking round she answered
has she gone to bed  no she doesnt like to go to bed said the young girl
she doesnt sleepnot three hours
she says she doesnt know how she lives
shes dreadfully nervous
i guess she sleeps more than she thinks
shes gone somewhere after randolph she wants to try to get him to go to bed
he doesnt like to go to bed  let us hope she will persuade him observed winterbourne
she will talk to him all she can but he doesnt like her to talk to him said miss daisy opening her fan
shes going to try to get eugenio to talk to him
but he isnt afraid of eugenio
eugenios a splendid courier but he cant make much impression on randolph
i dont believe hell go to bed before eleven it appeared that randolphs vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged for winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother
i have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to his companion resumed
shes your aunt then on winterbournes admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it she said she had heard all about mrs costello from the chambermaid
she was very quiet and very comme il faut she wore white puffs she spoke to no one and she never dined at the table dhote
every two days she had a headache
i think thats a lovely description headache and all said miss daisy chattering along in her thin gay voice
i want to know her ever so much
i know just what your aunt would be i know i should like her
she would be very exclusive
i like a lady to be exclusive im dying to be exclusive myself
well we are exclusive mother and i
we dont speak to everyoneor they dont speak to us
i suppose its about the same thing
anyway i shall be ever so glad to know your aunt  winterbourne was embarrassed
she would be most happy he said but i am afraid those headaches will interfere  the young girl looked at him through the dusk
but i suppose she doesnt have a headache every day she said sympathetically
winterbourne was silent a moment
she tells me she does he answered at last not knowing what to say
miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him
her prettiness was still visible in the darkness she was opening and closing her enormous fan
she doesnt want to know me she said suddenly
why dont you say so
you neednt be afraid
im not afraid and she gave a little laugh
winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice he was touched shocked mortified by it
my dear young lady he protested she knows no one
its her wretched health  the young girl walked on a few steps laughing still
you neednt be afraid she repeated
why should she want to know me then she paused again she was close to the parapet of the garden and in front of her was the starlit lake
there was a vague sheen upon its surface and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms
daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh
gracious
she is exclusive she said
winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her
he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes
he felt then for the instant quite ready to sacrifice his aunt conversationally to admit that she was a proud rude woman and to declare that they neednt mind her
but before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety the young lady resuming her walk gave an exclamation in quite another tone
well heres mother
i guess she hasnt got randolph to go to bed the figure of a lady appeared at a distance very indistinct in the darkness and advancing with a slow and wavering movement
suddenly it seemed to pause
are you sure it is your mother
can you distinguish her in this thick dusk winterbourne asked
well cried miss daisy miller with a laugh i guess i know my own mother
and when she has got on my shawl too
she is always wearing my things  the lady in question ceasing to advance hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps
i am afraid your mother doesnt see you said winterbourne
or perhaps he added thinking with miss miller the joke permissibleperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl  oh its a fearful old thing the young girl replied serenely
i told her she could wear it
she wont come here because she sees you  ah then said winterbourne i had better leave you  oh no come on urged miss daisy miller
im afraid your mother doesnt approve of my walking with you  miss miller gave him a serious glance
it isnt for me its for youthat is its for her
well i dont know who its for
but mother doesnt like any of my gentlemen friends
shes right down timid
she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman
but i do introduce themalmost always
if i didnt introduce my gentlemen friends to mother the young girl added in her little soft flat monotone i shouldnt think i was natural  to introduce me said winterbourne you must know my name and he proceeded to pronounce it
oh dear i cant say all that said his companion with a laugh
but by this time they had come up to mrs miller who as they drew near walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them
mother said the young girl in a tone of decision
upon this the elder lady turned round
mr
winterbourne said miss daisy miller introducing the young man very frankly and prettily
common she was as mrs costello had pronounced her yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that with her commonness she had a singularly delicate grace
her mother was a small spare light person with a wandering eye a very exiguous nose and a large forehead decorated with a certain amount of thin much frizzled hair
like her daughter mrs miller was dressed with extreme elegance she had enormous diamonds in her ears
so far as winterbourne could observe she gave him no greetingshe certainly was not looking at him
daisy was near her pulling her shawl straight
what are you doing poking round here this young lady inquired but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply
i dont know said her mother turning toward the lake again
i shouldnt think youd want that shawl daisy exclaimed
well i do her mother answered with a little laugh
did you get randolph to go to bed asked the young girl
no i couldnt induce him said mrs miller very gently
he wants to talk to the waiter
he likes to talk to that waiter  i was telling mr winterbourne the young girl went on and to the young mans ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life
oh yes said winterbourne i have the pleasure of knowing your son  randolphs mamma was silent she turned her attention to the lake
but at last she spoke
well i dont see how he lives  anyhow it isnt so bad as it was at dover said daisy miller
and what occurred at dover winterbourne asked
he wouldnt go to bed at all
i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor
he wasnt in bed at twelve oclock i know that  it was halfpast twelve declared mrs miller with mild emphasis
does he sleep much during the day winterbourne demanded
i guess he doesnt sleep much daisy rejoined
i wish he would said her mother
it seems as if he couldnt  i think hes real tiresome daisy pursued
then for some moments there was silence
well daisy miller said the elder lady presently i shouldnt think youd want to talk against your own brother  well he is tiresome mother said daisy quite without the asperity of a retort
hes only nine urged mrs miller
well he wouldnt go to that castle said the young girl
im going there with mr winterbourne  to this announcement very placidly made daisys mamma offered no response
winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion but he said to himself that she was a simple easily managed person and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure
yes he began your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide  mrs millers wandering eyes attached themselves with a sort of appealing air to daisy who however strolled a few steps farther gently humming to herself
i presume you will go in the cars said her mother
yes or in the boat said winterbourne
well of course i dont know mrs miller rejoined
i have never been to that castle  it is a pity you shouldnt go said winterbourne beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition
and yet he was quite prepared to find that as a matter of course she meant to accompany her daughter
weve been thinking ever so much about going she pursued but it seems as if we couldnt
of course daisyshe wants to go round
but theres a lady herei dont know her nameshe says she shouldnt think wed want to go to see castles here she should think wed want to wait till we got to italy
it seems as if there would be so many there  continued mrs miller with an air of increasing confidence
of course we only want to see the principal ones
we visited several in england  she presently added
ah yes
in england there are beautiful castles said winterbourne
but chillon here is very well worth seeing  well if daisy feels up to it said mrs miller in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise
it seems as if there was nothing she wouldnt undertake  oh i think shell enjoy it winterbourne declared
and he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a teteatete with the young lady who was still strolling along in front of them softly vocalizing
you are not disposed madam he inquired to undertake it yourself  daisys mother looked at him an instant askance and then walked forward in silence
theni guess she had better go alone she said simply
winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake
but his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by mrs millers unprotected daughter
mr
winterbourne murmured daisy
mademoiselle said the young man
dont you want to take me out in a boat  at present he asked
of course said daisy
well annie miller exclaimed her mother
i beg you madam to let her go said winterbourne ardently for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl
i shouldnt think shed want to said her mother
i should think shed rather go indoors  im sure mr winterbourne wants to take me daisy declared
hes so awfully devoted  i will row you over to chillon in the starlight  i dont believe it said daisy
well ejaculated the elder lady again
you havent spoken to me for half an hour her daughter went on
i have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother  said winterbourne
well i want you to take me out in a boat daisy repeated
they had all stopped and she had turned round and was looking at winterbourne
her face wore a charming smile her pretty eyes were gleaming she was swinging her great fan about
no its impossible to be prettier than that thought winterbourne
there are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place he said pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake
if you will do me the honor to accept my arm we will go and select one of them  daisy stood there smiling she threw back her head and gave a little light laugh
i like a gentleman to be formal she declared
i assure you its a formal offer  i was bound i would make you say something daisy went on
you see its not very difficult said winterbourne
but i am afraid you are chaffing me  i think not sir remarked mrs miller very gently
do then let me give you a row he said to the young girl
its quite lovely the way you say that cried daisy
it will be still more lovely to do it  yes it would be lovely said daisy
but she made no movement to accompany him she only stood there laughing
i should think you had better find out what time it is interposed her mother
it is eleven oclock madam said a voice with a foreign accent out of the neighboring darkness and winterbourne turning perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies
he had apparently just approached
oh eugenio said daisy i am going out in a boat  eugenio bowed
at eleven oclock mademoiselle  i am going with mr winterbournethis very minute  do tell her she cant said mrs miller to the courier
i think you had better not go out in a boat mademoiselle eugenio declared
winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier but he said nothing
i suppose you dont think its proper daisy exclaimed
eugenio doesnt think anythings proper  i am at your service said winterbourne
does mademoiselle propose to go alone asked eugenio of mrs miller
oh no with this gentleman answered daisys mamma
the courier looked for a moment at winterbournethe latter thought he was smilingand then solemnly with a bow as mademoiselle pleases  he said
oh i hoped you would make a fuss said daisy
i dont care to go now  i myself shall make a fuss if you dont go said winterbourne
thats all i wanta little fuss and the young girl began to laugh again
mr
randolph has gone to bed the courier announced frigidly
oh daisy now we can go said mrs miller
daisy turned away from winterbourne looking at him smiling and fanning herself
good night she said i hope you are disappointed or disgusted or something  he looked at her taking the hand she offered him
i am puzzled he answered
well i hope it wont keep you awake she said very smartly and under the escort of the privileged eugenio the two ladies passed toward the house
winterbourne stood looking after them he was indeed puzzled
he lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour turning over the mystery of the young girls sudden familiarities and caprices
but the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly going off with her somewhere
two days afterward he went off with her to the castle of chillon
he waited for her in the large hall of the hotel where the couriers the servants the foreign tourists were lounging about and staring
it was not the place he should have chosen but she had appointed it
she came tripping downstairs buttoning her long gloves squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume
winterbourne was a man of imagination and as our ancestors used to say sensibility as he looked at her dress and on the great staircase her little rapid confiding step he felt as if there were something romantic going forward
he could have believed he was going to elope with her
he passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there they were all looking at her very hard she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him
winterbournes preference had been that they should be conveyed to chillon in a carriage but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer she declared that she had a passion for steamboats
there was always such a lovely breeze upon the water and you saw such lots of people
the sail was not long but winterbournes companion found time to say a great many things
to the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapadean adventurethat even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way
but it must be confessed that in this particular he was disappointed
daisy miller was extremely animated she was in charming spirits but she was apparently not at all excited she was not fluttered she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her
people continued to look at her a great deal and winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companions distinguished air
he had been a little afraid that she would talk loud laugh overmuch and even perhaps desire to move about the boat a good deal
but he quite forgot his fears he sat smiling with his eyes upon her face while without moving from her place she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections
it was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard
he had assented to the idea that she was common but was she so after all or was he simply getting used to her commonness
her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast but every now and then it took a subjective turn
what on earth are you so grave about she suddenly demanded fixing her agreeable eyes upon winterbournes
am i grave he asked
i had an idea i was grinning from ear to ear  you look as if you were taking me to a funeral
if thats a grin your ears are very near together  should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck  pray do and ill carry round your hat
it will pay the expenses of our journey  i never was better pleased in my life murmured winterbourne
she looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh
i like to make you say those things
youre a queer mixture  in the castle after they had landed the subjective element decidedly prevailed
daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes and turned a singularly wellshaped ear to everything that winterbourne told her about the place
but he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of chillon made but a slight impression upon her
they had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian and winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurriedthat they should linger and pause wherever they chose
the custodian interpreted the bargain generouslywinterbourne on his side had been generousand ended by leaving them quite to themselves
miss millers observations were not remarkable for logical consistency for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext
she found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of chillon for asking winterbourne sudden questions about himselfhis family his previous history his tastes his habits his intentionsand for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality
of her own tastes habits and intentions miss miller was prepared to give the most definite and indeed the most favorable account
well i hope you know enough she said to her companion after he had told her the history of the unhappy bonivard
i never saw a man that knew so much the history of bonivard had evidently as they say gone into one ear and out of the other
but daisy went on to say that she wished winterbourne would travel with them and go round with them they might know something in that case
dont you want to come and teach randolph she asked
winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much but that he had unfortunately other occupations
other occupations
i dont believe it said miss daisy
what do you mean
you are not in business the young man admitted that he was not in business but he had engagements which even within a day or two would force him to go back to geneva
oh bother she said i dont believe it and she began to talk about something else
but a few moments later when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace she broke out irrelevantly you dont mean to say you are going back to geneva  it is a melancholy fact that i shall have to return to geneva tomorrow  well mr winterbourne said daisy i think youre horrid  oh dont say such dreadful things said winterbournejust at the last  the last cried the young girl i call it the first
i have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid
poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements
his companion after this ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of chillon or the beauties of the lake she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see
how did miss daisy miller know that there was a charmer in geneva
winterbourne who denied the existence of such a person was quite unable to discover and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage
she seemed to him in all this an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity
does she never allow you more than three days at a time asked daisy ironically
doesnt she give you a vacation in summer
theres no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season
i suppose if you stay another day shell come after you in the boat
do wait over till friday and i will go down to the landing to see her arrive  winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked
if he had missed the personal accent the personal accent was now making its appearance
it sounded very distinctly at last in her telling him she would stop teasing him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to rome in the winter
thats not a difficult promise to make said winterbourne
my aunt has taken an apartment in rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her  i dont want you to come for your aunt said daisy i want you to come for me and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman
he declared that at any rate he would certainly come
after this daisy stopped teasing
winterbourne took a carriage and they drove back to vevey in the dusk the young girl was very quiet
in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller
the americansof the courier asked this lady
ah happily said winterbourne the courier stayed at home  she went with you all alone  all alone  mrs costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle
and that she exclaimed is the young person whom you wanted me to know      part ii   winterbourne who had returned to geneva the day after his excursion to chillon went to rome toward the end of january
his aunt had been established there for several weeks and he had received a couple of letters from her
those people you were so devoted to last summer at vevey have turned up here courier and all she wrote
they seem to have made several acquaintances but the courier continues to be the most intime
the young lady however is also very intimate with some thirdrate italians with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk
bring me that pretty novel of cherbuliezspaule mereand dont come later than the rd  in the natural course of events winterbourne on arriving in rome would presently have ascertained mrs millers address at the american bankers and have gone to pay his compliments to miss daisy
after what happened at vevey i think i may certainly call upon them he said to mrs costello
if after what happensat vevey and everywhereyou desire to keep up the acquaintance you are very welcome
of course a man may know everyone
men are welcome to the privilege  pray what is it that happenshere for instance winterbourne demanded
the girl goes about alone with her foreigners
as to what happens further you must apply elsewhere for information
she has picked up half a dozen of the regular roman fortune hunters and she takes them about to peoples houses
when she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache  and where is the mother  i havent the least idea
they are very dreadful people  winterbourne meditated a moment
they are very ignorantvery innocent only
depend upon it they are not bad  they are hopelessly vulgar said mrs costello
whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians
they are bad enough to dislike at any rate and for this short life that is quite enough  the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbournes impulse to go straightway to see her
he had perhaps not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old roman window and asking herself urgently when mr winterbourne would arrive
if however he determined to wait a little before reminding miss miller of his claims to her consideration he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends
one of these friends was an american lady who had spent several winters at geneva where she had placed her children at school
she was a very accomplished woman and she lived in the via gregoriana
winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor the room was filled with southern sunshine
he had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in announcing madame mila this announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little randolph miller who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at winterbourne
an instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold and then after a considerable interval mrs miller slowly advanced
i know you said randolph
im sure you know a great many things exclaimed winterbourne taking him by the hand
how is your education coming on  daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess but when she heard winterbournes voice she quickly turned her head
well i declare she said
i told you i should come you know winterbourne rejoined smiling
well i didnt believe it said miss daisy
i am much obliged to you laughed the young man
you might have come to see me said daisy
i arrived only yesterday  i dont believe that the young girl declared
winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother but this lady evaded his glance and seating herself fixed her eyes upon her son
weve got a bigger place than this said randolph
its all gold on the walls  mrs miller turned uneasily in her chair
i told you if i were to bring you you would say something she murmured
i told you randolph exclaimed
i tell you sir he added jocosely giving winterbourne a thump on the knee
it is bigger too  daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother
i hope you have been well since we parted at vevey he said
mrs miller now certainly looked at himat his chin
not very well sir she answered
shes got the dyspepsia said randolph
ive got it too
fathers got it
ive got it most  this announcement instead of embarrassing mrs miller seemed to relieve her
i suffer from the liver she said
i think its this climate its less bracing than schenectady especially in the winter season
i dont know whether you know we reside at schenectady
i was saying to daisy that i certainly hadnt found any one like dr davis and i didnt believe i should
oh at schenectady he stands first they think everything of him
he has so much to do and yet there was nothing he wouldnt do for me
he said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia but he was bound to cure it
im sure there was nothing he wouldnt try
he was just going to try something new when we came off
mr miller wanted daisy to see europe for herself
but i wrote to mr miller that it seems as if i couldnt get on without dr davis
at schenectady he stands at the very top and theres a great deal of sickness there too
it affects my sleep  winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with dr daviss patient during which daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion
the young man asked mrs miller how she was pleased with rome
well i must say i am disappointed she answered
we had heard so much about it i suppose we had heard too much
but we couldnt help that
we had been led to expect something different  ah wait a little and you will become very fond of it said winterbourne
i hate it worse and worse every day cried randolph
you are like the infant hannibal said winterbourne
no i aint randolph declared at a venture
you are not much like an infant said his mother
but we have seen places she resumed that i should put a long way before rome and in reply to winterbournes interrogation theres zurich she concluded i think zurich is lovely and we hadnt heard half so much about it  the best place weve seen is the city of richmond said randolph
he means the ship his mother explained
we crossed in that ship
randolph had a good time on the city of richmond  its the best place ive seen the child repeated
only it was turned the wrong way  well weve got to turn the right way some time said mrs miller with a little laugh
winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in rome and she declared that daisy was quite carried away
its on account of the societythe societys splendid
she goes round everywhere she has made a great number of acquaintances
of course she goes round more than i do
i must say they have been very sociable they have taken her right in
and then she knows a great many gentlemen
oh she thinks theres nothing like rome
of course its a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen  by this time daisy had turned her attention again to winterbourne
ive been telling mrs walker how mean you were the young girl announced
and what is the evidence you have offered asked winterbourne rather annoyed at miss millers want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to rome had stopped neither at bologna nor at florence simply because of a certain sentimental impatience
he remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that american womenthe pretty ones and this gave a largeness to the axiomwere at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness
why you were awfully mean at vevey said daisy
you wouldnt do anything
you wouldnt stay there when i asked you  my dearest young lady cried winterbourne with eloquence have i come all the way to rome to encounter your reproaches  just hear him say that said daisy to her hostess giving a twist to a bow on this ladys dress
did you ever hear anything so quaint  so quaint my dear murmured mrs walker in the tone of a partisan of winterbourne
well i dont know said daisy fingering mrs walkers ribbons
mrs
walker i want to tell you something  motherr interposed randolph with his rough ends to his words i tell you youve got to go
eugenioll raisesomething  im not afraid of eugenio said daisy with a toss of her head
look here mrs walker she went on you know im coming to your party  i am delighted to hear it  ive got a lovely dress  i am very sure of that  but i want to ask a favorpermission to bring a friend  i shall be happy to see any of your friends said mrs walker turning with a smile to mrs miller
oh they are not my friends answered daisys mamma smiling shyly in her own fashion
i never spoke to them  its an intimate friend of minemr giovanelli said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face
mrs walker was silent a moment she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne
i shall be glad to see mr giovanelli she then said
hes an italian daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity
hes a great friend of mine hes the handsomest man in the worldexcept mr winterbourne
he knows plenty of italians but he wants to know some americans
he thinks ever so much of americans
hes tremendously clever
hes perfectly lovely  it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs walkers party and then mrs miller prepared to take her leave
i guess well go back to the hotel she said
you may go back to the hotel mother but im going to take a walk  said daisy
shes going to walk with mr giovanelli randolph proclaimed
i am going to the pincio said daisy smiling
alone my dearat this hour mrs walker asked
the afternoon was drawing to a closeit was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians
i dont think its safe my dear said mrs walker
neither do i subjoined mrs miller
youll get the fever as sure as you live
remember what dr davis told you  give her some medicine before she goes said randolph
the company had risen to its feet daisy still showing her pretty teeth bent over and kissed her hostess
mrs
walker you are too perfect she said
im not going alone i am going to meet a friend  your friend wont keep you from getting the fever mrs miller observed
is it mr giovanelli asked the hostess
winterbourne was watching the young girl at this question his attention quickened
she stood there smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons she glanced at winterbourne
then while she glanced and smiled she answered without a shade of hesitation mr
giovanellithe beautiful giovanelli  my dear young friend said mrs walker taking her hand pleadingly dont walk off to the pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful italian  well he speaks english said mrs miller
gracious me daisy exclaimed i dont to do anything improper
theres an easy way to settle it she continued to glance at winterbourne
the pincio is only a hundred yards distant and if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends he would offer to walk with me  winterbournes politeness hastened to affirm itself and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her
they passed downstairs before her mother and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs millers carriage drawn up with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at vevey seated within
goodbye eugenio cried daisy im going to take a walk the distance from the via gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the pincian hill is in fact rapidly traversed
as the day was splendid however and the concourse of vehicles walkers and loungers numerous the young americans found their progress much delayed
this fact was highly agreeable to winterbourne in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation
the slowmoving idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm and he wondered what on earth had been in daisys mind when she proposed to expose herself unattended to its appreciation
his own mission to her sense apparently was to consign her to the hands of mr giovanelli but winterbourne at once annoyed and gratified resolved that he would do no such thing
why havent you been to see me asked daisy
you cant get out of that  i have had the honor of telling you that i have only just stepped out of the train  you must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped cried the young girl with her little laugh
i suppose you were asleep
you have had time to go to see mrs walker  i knew mrs walker winterbourne began to explain
i know where you knew her
you knew her at geneva
she told me so
well you knew me at vevey
thats just as good
so you ought to have come she asked him no other question than this she began to prattle about her own affairs
weve got splendid rooms at the hotel eugenio says theyre the best rooms in rome
we are going to stay all winter if we dont die of the fever and i guess well stay then
its a great deal nicer than i thought i thought it would be fearfully quiet i was sure it would be awfully poky
i was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things
but we only had about a week of that and now im enjoying myself
i know ever so many people and they are all so charming
the societys extremely select
there are all kindsenglish and germans and italians
i think i like the english best
i like their style of conversation
but there are some lovely americans
i never saw anything so hospitable
theres something or other every day
theres not much dancing but i must say i never thought dancing was everything
i was always fond of conversation
i guess i shall have plenty at mrs walkers her rooms are so small when they had passed the gate of the pincian gardens miss miller began to wonder where mr giovanelli might be
we had better go straight to that place in front she said where you look at the view  i certainly shall not help you to find him winterbourne declared
then i shall find him without you cried miss daisy
you certainly wont leave me cried winterbourne
she burst into her little laugh
are you afraid youll get lostor run over
but theres giovanelli leaning against that tree
hes staring at the women in the carriages did you ever see anything so cool  winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane
he had a handsome face an artfully poised hat a glass in one eye and a nosegay in his buttonhole
winterbourne looked at him a moment and then said do you mean to speak to that man  do i mean to speak to him
why you dont suppose i mean to communicate by signs  pray understand then said winterbourne that i intend to remain with you  daisy stopped and looked at him without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples
well shes a cool one thought the young man
i dont like the way you say that said daisy
its too imperious  i beg your pardon if i say it wrong
the main point is to give you an idea of my meaning  the young girl looked at him more gravely but with eyes that were prettier than ever
i have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me or to interfere with anything i do  i think you have made a mistake said winterbourne
you should sometimes listen to a gentlemanthe right one  daisy began to laugh again
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen she exclaimed
tell me if mr giovanelli is the right one  the gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity
he bowed to winterbourne as well as to the latters companion he had a brilliant smile an intelligent eye winterbourne thought him not a badlooking fellow
but he nevertheless said to daisy no hes not the right one  daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other
she strolled alone with one of them on each side of her mr giovanelli who spoke english very cleverlywinterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many american heiressesaddressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense he was extremely urbane and the young american who said nothing reflected upon that profundity of italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed
giovanelli of course had counted upon something more intimate he had not bargained for a party of three
but he kept his temper in a manner which suggested farstretching intentions
winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure
he is not a gentleman said the young american he is only a clever imitation of one
he is a music master or a pennyaliner or a thirdrate artist
dn his good looks mr giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face but winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywomans not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one
giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable
it was true that if he was an imitation the imitation was brilliant
nevertheless winterbourne said to himself a nice girl ought to know and then he came back to the question whether this was in fact a nice girl
would a nice girl even allowing for her being a little american flirt make a rendezvous with a presumably lowlived foreigner
the rendezvous in this case indeed had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of rome but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism
singular though it may seem winterbourne was vexed that the young girl in joining her amoroso should not appear more impatient of his own company and he was vexed because of his inclination
it was impossible to regard her as a perfectly wellconducted young lady she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy
it would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers lawless passions that she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing
but daisy on this occasion continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence
she had been walking some quarter of an hour attended by her two cavaliers and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety as it seemed to winterbourne to the pretty speeches of mr giovanelli when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path
at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs walkerthe lady whose house he had lately leftwas seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him
leaving miss millers side he hastened to obey her summons
mrs walker was flushed she wore an excited air
it is really too dreadful she said
that girl must not do this sort of thing
she must not walk here with you two men
fifty people have noticed her  winterbourne raised his eyebrows
i think its a pity to make too much fuss about it  its a pity to let the girl ruin herself  she is very innocent said winterbourne
shes very crazy cried mrs walker
did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother
after you had all left me just now i could not sit still for thinking of it
it seemed too pitiful not even to attempt to save her
i ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet and came here as quickly as possible
thank heaven i have found you  what do you propose to do with us asked winterbourne smiling
to ask her to get in to drive her about here for half an hour so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild and then to take her safely home  i dont think its a very happy thought said winterbourne but you can try  mrs walker tried
the young man went in pursuit of miss miller who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion
daisy on learning that mrs walker wished to speak to her retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mr giovanelli at her side
she declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to mrs walker
she immediately achieved the introduction and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as mrs walkers carriage rug
i am glad you admire it said this lady smiling sweetly
will you get in and let me put it over you  oh no thank you said daisy
i shall admire it much more as i see you driving round with it  do get in and drive with me said mrs walker
that would be charming but its so enchanting just as i am and daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her
it may be enchanting dear child but it is not the custom here urged mrs walker leaning forward in her victoria with her hands devoutly clasped
well it ought to be then said daisy
if i didnt walk i should expire  you should walk with your mother dear cried the lady from geneva losing patience
with my mother dear exclaimed the young girl
winterbourne saw that she scented interference
my mother never walked ten steps in her life
and then you know she added with a laugh i am more than five years old  you are old enough to be more reasonable
you are old enough dear miss miller to be talked about  daisy looked at mrs walker smiling intensely
talked about
what do you mean  come into my carriage and i will tell you  daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other
mr giovanelli was bowing to and fro rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene
i dont think i want to know what you mean said daisy presently
i dont think i should like it  winterbourne wished that mrs walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away but this lady did not enjoy being defied as she afterward told him
should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl she demanded
gracious exclaimed daisy
she looked again at mr giovanelli then she turned to winterbourne
there was a little pink flush in her cheek she was tremendously pretty
does mr winterbourne think she asked slowly smiling throwing back her head and glancing at him from head to foot that to save my reputation i ought to get into the carriage  winterbourne colored for an instant he hesitated greatly
it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her reputation but he himself in fact must speak in accordance with gallantry
the finest gallantry here was simply to tell her the truth and the truth for winterbourne as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader was that daisy miller should take mrs walkers advice
he looked at her exquisite prettiness and then he said very gently i think you should get into the carriage  daisy gave a violent laugh
i never heard anything so stiff
if this is improper mrs walker she pursued then i am all improper and you must give me up
goodbye i hope youll have a lovely ride and with mr giovanelli who made a triumphantly obsequious salute she turned away
mrs walker sat looking after her and there were tears in mrs walkers eyes
get in here sir she said to winterbourne indicating the place beside her
the young man answered that he felt bound to accompany miss miller whereupon mrs walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again
she was evidently in earnest
winterbourne overtook daisy and her companion and offering the young girl his hand told her that mrs walker had made an imperious claim upon his society
he expected that in answer she would say something rather free something to commit herself still further to that recklessness from which mrs walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her
but she only shook his hand hardly looking at him while mr giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat
winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in mrs walkers victoria
that was not clever of you he said candidly while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages
in such a case his companion answered i dont wish to be clever i wish to be earnest  well your earnestness has only offended her and put her off  it has happened very well said mrs walker
if she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself the sooner one knows it the better one can act accordingly  i suspect she meant no harm winterbourne rejoined
so i thought a month ago
but she has been going too far  what has she been doing  everything that is not done here
flirting with any man she could pick up sitting in corners with mysterious italians dancing all the evening with the same partners receiving visits at eleven oclock at night
her mother goes away when visitors come  but her brother said winterbourne laughing sits up till midnight  he must be edified by what he sees
im told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for miss miller  the servants be hanged said winterbourne angrily
the poor girls only fault he presently added is that she is very uncultivated  she is naturally indelicate mrs walker declared
take that example this morning
how long had you known her at vevey  a couple of days  fancy then her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place  winterbourne was silent for some moments then he said i suspect mrs walker that you and i have lived too long at geneva and he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage
i wished to beg you to cease your relations with miss millernot to flirt with herto give her no further opportunity to expose herselfto let her alone in short  im afraid i cant do that said winterbourne
i like her extremely  all the more reason that you shouldnt help her to make a scandal  there shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her  there certainly will be in the way she takes them
but i have said what i had on my conscience mrs walker pursued
if you wish to rejoin the young lady i will put you down
here by the way you have a chance  the carriage was traversing that part of the pincian garden that overhangs the wall of rome and overlooks the beautiful villa borghese
it is bordered by a large parapet near which there are several seats
one of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady toward whom mrs walker gave a toss of her head
at the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet
winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop he now descended from the carriage
his companion looked at him a moment in silence then while he raised his hat she drove majestically away
winterbourne stood there he had turned his eyes toward daisy and her cavalier
they evidently saw no one they were too deeply occupied with each other
when they reached the low garden wall they stood a moment looking off at the great flattopped pine clusters of the villa borghese then giovanelli seated himself familiarly upon the broad ledge of the wall
the western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars whereupon daisys companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it
she came a little nearer and he held the parasol over her then still holding it he let it rest upon her shoulder so that both of their heads were hidden from winterbourne
this young man lingered a moment then he began to walk
but he walkednot toward the couple with the parasol toward the residence of his aunt mrs costello
he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he at least asked for mrs miller at her hotel
this lady and her daughter however were not at home and on the next day after repeating his visit winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them
mrs walkers party took place on the evening of the third day and in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess winterbourne was among the guests
mrs walker was one of those american ladies who while residing abroad make a point in their own phrase of studying european society and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve as it were as textbooks
when winterbourne arrived daisy miller was not there but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone very shyly and ruefully
mrs millers hair above her exposedlooking temples was more frizzled than ever
as she approached mrs walker winterbourne also drew near
you see ive come all alone said poor mrs miller
im so frightened i dont know what to do
its the first time ive ever been to a party alone especially in this country
i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio or someone but daisy just pushed me off by myself
i aint used to going round alone  and does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society  demanded mrs walker impressively
well daisys all dressed said mrs miller with that accent of the dispassionate if not of the philosophic historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughters career
she got dressed on purpose before dinner
but shes got a friend of hers there that gentlemanthe italianthat she wanted to bring
theyve got going at the piano it seems as if they couldnt leave off
mr giovanelli sings splendidly
but i guess theyll come before very long concluded mrs miller hopefully
im sorry she should come in that way said mrs walker
well i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours responded daisys mamma
i didnt see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr giovanelli  this is most horrible said mrs walker turning away and addressing herself to winterbourne
elle saffiche
its her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her
when she comes i shall not speak to her  daisy came after eleven oclock but she was not on such an occasion a young lady to wait to be spoken to
she rustled forward in radiant loveliness smiling and chattering carrying a large bouquet and attended by mr giovanelli
everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her
she came straight to mrs walker
im afraid you thought i never was coming so i sent mother off to tell you
i wanted to make mr giovanelli practice some things before he came you know he sings beautifully and i want you to ask him to sing
this is mr giovanelli you know i introduced him to you hes got the most lovely voice and he knows the most charming set of songs
i made him go over them this evening on purpose we had the greatest time at the hotel of all this daisy delivered herself with the sweetest brightest audibleness looking now at her hostess and now round the room while she gave a series of little pats round her shoulders to the edges of her dress
is there anyone i know she asked
i think every one knows you said mrs walker pregnantly and she gave a very cursory greeting to mr giovanelli
this gentleman bore himself gallantly
he smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome italian at an evening party
he sang very prettily half a dozen songs though mrs walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him
it was apparently not daisy who had given him his orders
daisy sat at a distance from the piano and though she had publicly as it were professed a high admiration for his singing talked not inaudibly while it was going on
its a pity these rooms are so small we cant dance she said to winterbourne as if she had seen him five minutes before
i am not sorry we cant dance winterbourne answered i dont dance  of course you dont dance youre too stiff said miss daisy
i hope you enjoyed your drive with mrs walker  no
i didnt enjoy it i preferred walking with you  we paired off that was much better said daisy
but did you ever hear anything so cool as mrs walkers wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor mr giovanelli and under the pretext that it was proper
people have different ideas
it would have been most unkind he had been talking about that walk for ten days  he should not have talked about it at all said winterbourne he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him  about the streets cried daisy with her pretty stare
where then would he have proposed to her to walk
the pincio is not the streets either and i thank goodness am not a young lady of this country
the young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it so far as i can learn i dont see why i should change my habits for them  i am afraid your habits are those of a flirt said winterbourne gravely
of course they are she cried giving him her little smiling stare again
im a fearful frightful flirt
did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not
but i suppose you will tell me now that i am not a nice girl  youre a very nice girl but i wish you would flirt with me and me only said winterbourne
ah
thank youthank you very much you are the last man i should think of flirting with
as i have had the pleasure of informing you you are too stiff  you say that too often said winterbourne
daisy gave a delighted laugh
if i could have the sweet hope of making you angry i should say it again  dont do that when i am angry im stiffer than ever
but if you wont flirt with me do cease at least to flirt with your friend at the piano they dont understand that sort of thing here  i thought they understood nothing else exclaimed daisy
not in young unmarried women  it seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones daisy declared
well said winterbourne when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place
flirting is a purely american custom it doesnt exist here
so when you show yourself in public with mr giovanelli and without your mother  gracious
poor mother interposed daisy
though you may be flirting mr giovanelli is not he means something else  he isnt preaching at any rate said daisy with vivacity
and if you want very much to know we are neither of us flirting we are too good friends for that we are very intimate friends  ah rejoined winterbourne if you are in love with each other it is another affair  she had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation but she immediately got up blushing visibly and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little american flirts were the queerest creatures in the world
mr
giovanelli at least she said giving her interlocutor a single glance never says such very disagreeable things to me  winterbourne was bewildered he stood staring
mr giovanelli had finished singing
he left the piano and came over to daisy
wont you come into the other room and have some tea he asked bending before her with his ornamental smile
daisy turned to winterbourne beginning to smile again
he was still more perplexed for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear though it seemed to prove indeed that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses
it has never occurred to mr winterbourne to offer me any tea she said with her little tormenting manner
i have offered you advice winterbourne rejoined
i prefer weak tea cried daisy and she went off with the brilliant giovanelli
she sat with him in the adjoining room in the embrasure of the window for the rest of the evening
there was an interesting performance at the piano but neither of these young people gave heed to it
when daisy came to take leave of mrs walker this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girls arrival
she turned her back straight upon miss miller and left her to depart with what grace she might
winterbourne was standing near the door he saw it all
daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother but mrs miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms
she appeared indeed to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them
good night mrs walker she said weve had a beautiful evening
you see if i let daisy come to parties without me i dont want her to go away without me daisy turned away looking with a pale grave face at the circle near the door winterbourne saw that for the first moment she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation
he on his side was greatly touched
that was very cruel he said to mrs walker
she never enters my drawing room again replied his hostess
since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs walkers drawing room he went as often as possible to mrs millers hotel
the ladies were rarely at home but when he found them the devoted giovanelli was always present
very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone mrs miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance
winterbourne noted at first with surprise that daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect
she showed no displeasure at her teteatete with giovanelli being interrupted she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one there was always in her conversation the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility
winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in giovanelli it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews and he liked her the more for her innocentlooking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor
he could hardly have said why but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous
at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readers part i may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him it very often seemed to winterbourne among the possibilities that given certain contingencies he should be afraidliterally afraidof these ladies he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller
it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy it was part of his conviction or rather of his apprehension that she would prove a very light young person
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli
she looked at him whenever he spoke she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that she was constantly chaffing and abusing him
she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs walkers little party
one sunday afternoon having gone to st peters with his aunt winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli
presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to mrs costello
this lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass and then she said  thats what makes you so pensive in these days eh  i had not the least idea i was pensive said the young man
you are very much preoccupied you are thinking of something  and what is it he asked that you accuse me of thinking of  of that young ladysmiss bakers miss chandlerswhats her namemiss millers intrigue with that little barbers block  do you call it an intrigue winterbourne askedan affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity  thats their folly said mrs costello its not their merit  no rejoined winterbourne with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded
i dont believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue  i have heard a dozen people speak of it they say she is quite carried away by him  they are certainly very intimate said winterbourne
mrs costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument
he is very handsome
one easily sees how it is
she thinks him the most elegant man in the world the finest gentleman
she has never seen anything like him he is better even than the courier
it was the courier probably who introduced him and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady the courier will come in for a magnificent commission  i dont believe she thinks of marrying him said winterbourne and i dont believe he hopes to marry her  you may be very sure she thinks of nothing
she goes on from day to day from hour to hour as they did in the golden age
i can imagine nothing more vulgar
and at the same time added mrs costello depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is engaged  i think that is more than giovanelli expects said winterbourne
who is giovanelli  the little italian
i have asked questions about him and learned something
he is apparently a perfectly respectable little man
i believe he is in a small way a cavaliere avvocato
but he doesnt move in what are called the first circles
i think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him
he is evidently immensely charmed with miss miller
if she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world he on his side has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor such opulence such expensiveness as this young ladys
and then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting
i rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her
that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck
he has nothing but his handsome face to offer and there is a substantial mr miller in that mysterious land of dollars
giovanelli knows that he hasnt a title to offer
if he were only a count or a marchese
he must wonder at his luck at the way they have taken him up  he accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies said mrs costello
it is very true winterbourne pursued that daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofwhat shall i call itof culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins
i believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception  ah
but the avvocato cant believe it said mrs costello
of the observation excited by daisys intrigue winterbourne gathered that day at st peters sufficient evidence
a dozen of the american colonists in rome came to talk with mrs costello who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters
the vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir and meanwhile between mrs costello and her friends there was a great deal said about poor little miss millers going really too far winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard but when coming out upon the great steps of the church he saw daisy who had emerged before him get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of rome he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed
he felt very sorry for hernot exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty and undefended and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder
he made an attempt after this to give a hint to mrs miller
he met one day in the corso a friend a tourist like himself who had just come out of the doria palace where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery
his friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of innocent x by velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace and then said and in the same cabinet by the way i had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kindthat pretty american girl whom you pointed out to me last week in answer to winterbournes inquiries his friend narrated that the pretty american girlprettier than everwas seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined
who was her companion asked winterbourne
a little italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole
the girl is delightfully pretty but i thought i understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde  so she is answered winterbourne and having assured himself that his informant had seen daisy and her companion but five minutes before he jumped into a cab and went to call on mrs miller
she was at home but she apologized to him for receiving him in daisys absence
shes gone out somewhere with mr giovanelli said mrs miller
shes always going round with mr giovanelli  i have noticed that they are very intimate winterbourne observed
oh it seems as if they couldnt live without each other said mrs miller
well hes a real gentleman anyhow
i keep telling daisy shes engaged  and what does daisy say  oh she says she isnt engaged
but she might as well be this impartial parent resumed she goes on as if she was
but ive made mr giovanelli promise to tell me if she doesnt
i should want to write to mr miller about itshouldnt you  winterbourne replied that he certainly should and the state of mind of daisys mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard
after this daisy was never at home and winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances because as he perceived these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far
they ceased to invite her and they intimated that they desired to express to observant europeans the great truth that though miss daisy miller was a young american lady her behavior was not representativewas regarded by her compatriots as abnormal
winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all
he said to himself that she was too light and childish too uncultivated and unreasoning too provincial to have reflected upon her ostracism or even to have perceived it
then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant passionate perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced
he asked himself whether daisys defiance came from the consciousness of innocence or from her being essentially a young person of the reckless class
it must be admitted that holding ones self to a belief in daisys innocence came to seem to winterbourne more and more a matter of finespun gallantry
as i have already had occasion to relate he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic national and how far they were personal
from either view of them he had somehow missed her and now it was too late
she was carried away by mr giovanelli
a few days after his brief interview with her mother he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the palace of the caesars
the early roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume and the rugged surface of the palatine was muffled with tender verdure
daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions
it seemed to him that rome had never been so lovely as just then
he stood looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city inhaling the softly humid odors and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion
it seemed to him also that daisy had never looked so pretty but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her
giovanelli was at her side and giovanelli too wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy
well said daisy i should think you would be lonesome  lonesome asked winterbourne
you are always going round by yourself
cant you get anyone to walk with you  i am not so fortunate said winterbourne as your companion  giovanelli from the first had treated winterbourne with distinguished politeness
he listened with a deferential air to his remarks he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that winterbourne was a superior young man
he carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer he had obviously a great deal of tact he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him
it even seemed to winterbourne at times that giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with himto say to him as an intelligent man that bless you he knew how extraordinary was this young lady and didnt flatter himself with delusiveor at least too delusivehopes of matrimony and dollars
on this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole
i know why you say that said daisy watching giovanelli
because you think i go round too much with him and she nodded at her attendant
every one thinks soif you care to know said winterbourne
of course i care to know daisy exclaimed seriously
but i dont believe it
they are only pretending to be shocked
they dont really care a straw what i do
besides i dont go round so much  i think you will find they do care
they will show it disagreeably  daisy looked at him a moment
how disagreeably  havent you noticed anything winterbourne asked
i have noticed you
but i noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time i saw you  you will find i am not so stiff as several others said winterbourne smiling
how shall i find it  by going to see the others  what will they do to me  they will give you the cold shoulder
do you know what that means  daisy was looking at him intently she began to color
do you mean as mrs walker did the other night  exactly said winterbourne
she looked away at giovanelli who was decorating himself with his almond blossom
then looking back at winterbourne i shouldnt think you would let people be so unkind she said
how can i help it he asked
i should think you would say something  i do say something and he paused a moment
i say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged  well she does said daisy very simply
winterbourne began to laugh
and does randolph believe it he asked
i guess randolph doesnt believe anything said daisy
randolphs skepticism excited winterbourne to further hilarity and he observed that giovanelli was coming back to them
daisy observing it too addressed herself again to her countryman
since you have mentioned it she said i am engaged    winterbourne looked at her he had stopped laughing
you dont believe she added
he was silent a moment and then yes i believe it he said
oh no you dont she answered
well theni am not  the young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure so that winterbourne who had but lately entered presently took leave of them
a week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the caelian hill and on arriving dismissed his hired vehicle
the evening was charming and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the arch of constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the forum
there was a waning moon in the sky and her radiance was not brilliant but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it
when on his return from the villa it was eleven oclock winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the colosseum it recurred to him as a lover of the picturesque that the interior in the pale moonshine would be well worth a glance
he turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches near which as he observed an open carriageone of the little roman streetcabswas stationed
then he passed in among the cavernous shadows of the great structure and emerged upon the clear and silent arena
the place had never seemed to him more impressive
onehalf of the gigantic circus was in deep shade the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk
as he stood there he began to murmur byrons famous lines out of manfred but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the colosseum are recommended by the poets they are deprecated by the doctors
the historic atmosphere was there certainly but the historic atmosphere scientifically considered was no better than a villainous miasma
winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena to take a more general glance intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat
the great cross in the center was covered with shadow it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly
then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base
one of these was a woman seated her companion was standing in front of her
presently the sound of the womans voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air
well he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the christian martyrs these were the words he heard in the familiar accent of miss daisy miller
let us hope he is not very hungry responded the ingenious giovanelli
he will have to take me first you will serve for dessert  winterbourne stopped with a sort of horror and it must be added with a sort of relief
it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisys behavior and the riddle had become easy to read
she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect
he stood there looking at herlooking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely he himself must have been more brightly visible
he felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding miss daisy miller
then as he was going to advance again he checked himself not from the fear that he was doing her injustice but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism
he turned away toward the entrance of the place but as he did so he heard daisy speak again
why it was mr winterbourne
he saw me and he cuts me  what a clever little reprobate she was and how smartly she played at injured innocence
but he wouldnt cut her
winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross
daisy had got up giovanelli lifted his hat
winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness from a sanitary point of view of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria
what if she were a clever little reprobate
that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa
how long have you been here he asked almost brutally
daisy lovely in the flattering moonlight looked at him a moment
thenall the evening she answered gently
   i never saw anything so pretty  i am afraid said winterbourne that you will not think roman fever very pretty
this is the way people catch it
i wonder he added turning to giovanelli that you a native roman should countenance such a terrible indiscretion  ah said the handsome native for myself i am not afraid  neither am ifor you
i am speaking for this young lady  giovanelli lifted his wellshaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth
but he took winterbournes rebuke with docility
i told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion but when was the signorina ever prudent  i never was sick and i dont mean to be the signorina declared
i dont look like much but im healthy
i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight i shouldnt have wanted to go home without that and we have had the most beautiful time havent we mr giovanelli
if there has been any danger eugenio can give me some pills
he has got some splendid pills  i should advise you said winterbourne to drive home as fast as possible and take one  what you say is very wise giovanelli rejoined
i will go and make sure the carriage is at hand and he went forward rapidly
daisy followed with winterbourne
he kept looking at her she seemed not in the least embarrassed
winterbourne said nothing daisy chattered about the beauty of the place
well i have seen the colosseum by moonlight she exclaimed
thats one good thing then noticing winterbournes silence she asked him why he didnt speak
he made no answer he only began to laugh
they passed under one of the dark archways giovanelli was in front with the carriage
here daisy stopped a moment looking at the young american
did you believe i was engaged the other day she asked
it doesnt matter what i believed the other day said winterbourne still laughing
well what do you believe now  i believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not  he felt the young girls pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway she was apparently going to answer
but giovanelli hurried her forward
quick
quick he said if we get in by midnight we are quite safe  daisy took her seat in the carriage and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her
dont forget eugenios pills said winterbourne as he lifted his hat
i dont care said daisy in a little strange tone whether i have roman fever or not upon this the cab driver cracked his whip and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement
winterbourne to do him justice as it were mentioned to no one that he had encountered miss miller at midnight in the colosseum with a gentleman but nevertheless a couple of days later the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little american circle and commented accordingly
winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel and that after daisys return there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver
but the young man was conscious at the same moment that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little american flirt should be talked about by lowminded menials
these people a day or two later had serious information to give the little american flirt was alarmingly ill winterbourne when the rumor came to him immediately went to the hotel for more news
he found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him and that they were being entertained in mrs millers salon by randolph
its going round at night said randolphthats what made her sick
shes always going round at night
i shouldnt think shed want to its so plaguy dark
you cant see anything here at night except when theres a moon
in america theres always a moon mrs miller was invisible she was now at least giving her daughter the advantage of her society
it was evident that daisy was dangerously ill  winterbourne went often to ask for news of her and once he saw mrs miller who though deeply alarmed was rather to his surprise perfectly composed and as it appeared a most efficient and judicious nurse
she talked a good deal about dr davis but winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not after all such a monstrous goose
daisy spoke of you the other day she said to him
half the time she doesnt know what shes saying but that time i think she did
she gave me a message she told me to tell you
she told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome italian
i am sure i am very glad mr giovanelli hasnt been near us since she was taken ill
i thought he was so much of a gentleman but i dont call that very polite
a lady told me that he was afraid i was angry with him for taking daisy round at night
well so i am but i suppose he knows im a lady
i would scorn to scold him
anyway she says shes not engaged
i dont know why she wanted you to know but she said to me three times mind you tell mr winterbourne and then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in switzerland
but i said i wouldnt give any such messages as that
only if she is not engaged im sure im glad to know it  but as winterbourne had said it mattered very little
a week after this the poor girl died it had been a terrible case of the fever
daisys grave was in the little protestant cemetery in an angle of the wall of imperial rome beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers
winterbourne stood there beside it with a number of other mourners a number larger than the scandal excited by the young ladys career would have led you to expect
near him stood giovanelli who came nearer still before winterbourne turned away
giovanelli was very pale on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole he seemed to wish to say something
at last he said she was the most beautiful young lady i ever saw and the most amiable and then he added in a moment and she was the most innocent  winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words and the most innocent  the most innocent  winterbourne felt sore and angry
why the devil he asked did you take her to that fatal place  mr giovanellis urbanity was apparently imperturbable
he looked on the ground a moment and then he said for myself i had no fear and she wanted to go  that was no reason winterbourne declared
the subtle roman again dropped his eyes
if she had lived i should have got nothing
she would never have married me i am sure  she would never have married you  for a moment i hoped so
but no
i am sure  winterbourne listened to him he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies
when he turned away again mr giovanelli with his light slow step had retired
winterbourne almost immediately left rome but the following summer he again met his aunt mrs costello at vevey
mrs costello was fond of vevey
in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners
one day he spoke of her to his auntsaid it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice
i am sure i dont know said mrs costello
how did your injustice affect her  she sent me a message before her death which i didnt understand at the time but i have understood it since
she would have appreciated ones esteem  is that a modest way asked mrs costello of saying that she would have reciprocated ones affection  winterbourne offered no answer to this question but he presently said you were right in that remark that you made last summer
i was booked to make a mistake
i have lived too long in foreign parts  nevertheless he went back to live at geneva whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn a report that he is studying hardan intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady
book first    i  strether's first question when he reached the hotel was about his friend yet on his learning that waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted
a telegram from him bespeaking a room only if not noisy reply paid was produced for the enquirer at the office so that the understanding they should meet at chester rather than at liverpool remained to that extent sound
the same secret principle however that had prompted strether not absolutely to desire waymarsh's presence at the dock that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment
they would dine together at the worst and with all respect to dear old waymarshif not even for that matter to himselfthere was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other
the principle i have just mentioned as operating had been with the most newly disembarked of the two men wholly instinctivethe fruit of a sharp sense that delightful as it would be to find himself looking after so much separation into his comrade's face his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first note of europe
mixed with everything was the apprehension already on strether's part that it would at best throughout prove the note of europe in quite a sufficient degree
that note had been meanwhilesince the previous afternoon thanks to this happier devicesuch a consciousness of personal freedom as he hadn't known for years such a deep taste of change and of having above all for the moment nobody and nothing to consider as promised already if headlong hope were not too foolish to colour his adventure with cool success
there were people on the ship with whom he had easily consortedso far as ease could up to now be imputed to himand who for the most part plunged straight into the current that set from the landingstage to london there were others who had invited him to a tryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a look round at the beauties of liverpool but he had stolen away from every one alike had kept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance had been indifferently aware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in being unlike himself met and had even independently unsociably alone without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion given his afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible
they formed a qualified draught of europe an afternoon and an evening on the banks of the mersey but such as it was he took his potion at least undiluted
he winced a little truly at the thought that waymarsh might be already at chester he reflected that should he have to describe himself there as having got in so early it would be difficult to make the interval look particularly eager but he was like a man who elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual handles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing himself to the business of spending
that he was prepared to be vague to waymarsh about the hour of the ship's touching and that he both wanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of delaythese things it is to be conceived were early signs in him that his relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest
he was burdened poor stretherit had better be confessed at the outsetwith the oddity of a double consciousness
there was detachment in his zeal and curiosity in his indifference
after the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her counter the palepink leaflet bearing his friend's name which she neatly pronounced he turned away to find himself in the hall facing a lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined and whose featuresnot freshly young not markedly fine but on happy terms with each othercame back to him as from a recent vision
for a moment they stood confronted then the moment placed her  he had noticed her the day before noticed her at his previous inn whereagain in the hallshe had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ship's company
nothing had actually passed between them and he would as little have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him on the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition
recognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as wellwhich would only have added to the mystery
all she now began by saying to him nevertheless was that having chanced to catch his enquiry she was moved to ask by his leave if it were possibly a question of mr waymarsh of milrose connecticutmr waymarsh the american lawyer
oh yes he replied my very wellknown friend
he's to meet me here coming up from malvern and i supposed he'd already have arrived
but he doesn't come till later and i'm relieved not to have kept him
do you know him
strether wound up
it wasn't till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much there had been in him of response when the tone of her own rejoinder as well as the play of something more in her facesomething more that is than its apparently usual restless lightseemed to notify him
i've met him at milrosewhere i used sometimes a good while ago to stay i had friends there who were friends of his and i've been at his house
i won't answer for it that he would know me strether's new acquaintance pursued but i should be delighted to see him
perhaps she added i shallfor i'm staying over
she paused while our friend took in these things and it was as if a good deal of talk had already passed
they even vaguely smiled at it and strether presently observed that mr waymarsh would no doubt be easily to be seen
this however appeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far
she appeared to have no reserves about anything
oh she said he won't care
and she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed strether knew the munsters the munsters being the people he had seen her with at liverpool
but he didn't it happened know the munsters well enough to give the case much of a lift so that they were left together as if over the mere laid table of conversation
her qualification of the mentioned connexion had rather removed than placed a dish and there seemed nothing else to serve
their attitude remained none the less that of not forsaking the board and the effect of this in turn was to give them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of preliminaries practically complete
they moved along the hall together and strether's companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of a garden
he was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence  he had shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of waymarsh only to find himself forsaken in this sudden case both of avoidance and of caution
he passed under this unsought protection and before he had so much as gone up to his room into the garden of the hotel and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again as soon as he should have made himself tidy the dispenser of such good assurances
he wanted to look at the town and they would forthwith look together
it was almost as if she had been in possession and received him as a guest
her acquaintance with the place presented her in a manner as a hostess and strether had a rueful glance for the lady in the glass cage
it was as if this personage had seen herself instantly superseded
when in a quarter of an hour he came down what his hostess saw what she might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted was the lean the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something more perhaps than the middle agea man of fiveandfifty whose most immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face a thick dark moustache of characteristically american cut growing strong and falling low a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked with grey and a nose of bold free prominence the even line the high finish as it might have been called of which had a certain effect of mitigation
a perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge and a line unusually deep and drawn the prolonged penstroke of time accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin did something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer would have seen catalogued on the spot in the vision of the other party to strether's appointment
she waited for him in the garden the other party drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which as he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery english sunshine he might with his rougher preparation have marked as the model for such an occasion
she had this lady a perfect plain propriety an expensive subdued suitability that her companion was not free to analyse but that struck him so that his consciousness of it was instantly acute as a quality quite new to him
before reaching her he stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for something possibly forgotten in the light overcoat he carried on his arm yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain time
nothing could have been odder than strether's sense of himself as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally beginning there and then
it had begun in fact already upstairs and before the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further so strangely the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom begun with a sharper survey of the elements of appearance than he had for a long time been moved to make
he had during those moments felt these elements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked and then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter as to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do
he was about to go up to london so that hat and necktie might wait
what had come as straight to him as a ball in a wellplayed gameand caught moreover not less neatlywas just the air in the person of his friend of having seen and chosen the air of achieved possession of those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the advantage snatched from lucky chances
without pomp or circumstance certainly as her original address to him equally with his own response had been he would have sketched to himself his impression of her as  well she's more thoroughly civilized
if more thoroughly than whom
would not have been for him a sequel to this remark that was just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his comparison
the amusement at all events of a civilisation intenser was whatfamiliar compatriot as she was with the full tone of the compatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear dyspeptic waymarshshe appeared distinctly to promise
his pause while he felt in his overcoat was positively the pause of confidence and it enabled his eyes to make out as much of a case for her in proportion as her own made out for himself
she affected him as almost insolently young but an easily carried fiveandthirty could still do that
she was however like himself marked and wan only it naturally couldn't have been known to him how much a spectator looking from one to the other might have discerned that they had in common
it wouldn't for such a spectator have been altogether insupposable that each so finely brown and so sharply spare each confessing so to dents of surface and aids to sight to a disproportionate nose and a head delicately or grossly grizzled they might have been brother and sister
on this ground indeed there would have been a residuum of difference such a sister having surely known in respect to such a brother the extremity of separation and such a brother now feeling in respect to such a sister the extremity of surprise
surprise it was true was not on the other hand what the eyes of strether's friend most showed him while she gave him stroking her gloves smoother the time he appreciated
they had taken hold of him straightway measuring him up and down as if they knew how as if he were human material they had already in some sort handled
their possessor was in truth it may be communicated the mistress of a hundred cases or categories receptacles of the mind subdivisions for convenience in which from a full experience she pigeonholed her fellow mortals with a hand as free as that of a compositor scattering type
she was as equipped in this particular as strether was the reverse and it made an opposition between them which he might well have shrunk from submitting to if he had fully suspected it
so far as he did suspect it he was on the contrary after a short shake of his consciousness as pleasantly passive as might be
he really had a sort of sense of what she knew
he had quite the sense that she knew things he didn't and though this was a concession that in general he found not easy to make to women he made it now as goodhumouredly as if it lifted a burden
his eyes were so quiet behind his eternal nippers that they might almost have been absent without changing his face which took its expression mainly and not least its stamp of sensibility from other sources surface and grain and form
he joined his guide in an instant and then felt she had profited still better than he by his having been for the moments just mentioned so at the disposal of her intelligence
she knew even intimate things about him that he hadn't yet told her and perhaps never would
he wasn't unaware that he had told her rather remarkably many for the time but these were not the real ones
some of the real ones however precisely were what she knew
they were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the street and it was here she presently checked him with a question
have you looked up my name
he could only stop with a laugh
have you looked up mine
oh dear yesas soon as you left me
i went to the office and asked
hadn't you better do the same
he wondered
find out who you areafter the uplifted young woman there has seen us thus scrape acquaintance
she laughed on her side now at the shade of alarm in his amusement
isn't it a reason the more
if what you're afraid of is the injury for memy being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who i ami assure you i don't in the least mind
here however she continued is my card and as i find there's something else again i have to say at the office you can just study it during the moment i leave you
she left him after he had taken from her the small pasteboard she had extracted from her pocketbook and he had extracted another from his own to exchange with it before she came back
he read thus the simple designation maria gostrey to which was attached in a corner of the card with a number the name of a street presumably in paris without other appreciable identity than its foreignness
he put the card into his waistcoat pocket keeping his own meanwhile in evidence and as he leaned against the doorpost he met with the smile of a straying thought what the expanse before the hotel offered to his view
it was positively droll to him that he should already have maria gostrey whoever she wasof which he hadn't really the least ideain a place of safe keeping
he had somehow an assurance that he should carefully preserve the little token he had just tucked in
he gazed with unseeing lingering eyes as he followed some of the implications of his act asking himself if he really felt admonished to qualify it as disloyal
it was prompt it was possibly even premature and there was little doubt of the expression of face the sight of it would have produced in a certain person
but if it was wrongwhy then he had better not have come out at all
at this poor man had he alreadyand even before meeting waymarsharrived
he had believed he had a limit but the limit had been transcended within thirtysix hours
by how long a space on the plane of manners or even of morals moreover he felt still more sharply after maria gostrey had come back to him and with a gay decisive so now
led him forth into the world
this counted it struck him as he walked beside her with his overcoat on an arm his umbrella under another and his personal pasteboard a little stiffly retained between forefinger and thumb this struck him as really in comparison his introduction to things
it hadn't been europe at liverpool nonot even in the dreadful delightful impressive streets the night beforeto the extent his present companion made it so
she hadn't yet done that so much as when after their walk had lasted a few minutes and he had had time to wonder if a couple of sidelong glances from her meant that he had best have put on gloves she almost pulled him up with an amused challenge
but whyfondly as it's so easy to imagine your clinging to itdon't you put it away
or if it's an inconvenience to you to carry it one's often glad to have one's card back
the fortune one spends in them
then he saw both that his way of marching with his own prepared tribute had affected her as a deviation in one of those directions he couldn't yet measure and that she supposed this emblem to be still the one he had received from her
he accordingly handed her the card as if in restitution but as soon as she had it she felt the difference and with her eyes on it stopped short for apology
i like she observed your name
oh he answered you won't have heard of it
yet he had his reasons for not being sure but that she perhaps might
ah it was but too visible
she read it over again as one who had never seen it
'mr
lewis lambert strether'she sounded it almost as freely as for any stranger
she repeated however that she liked itparticularly the lewis lambert
it's the name of a novel of balzac's
oh i know that
said strether
but the novel's an awfully bad one
i know that too strether smiled
to which he added with an irrelevance that was only superficial  i come from woollett massachusetts
it made her for some reasonthe irrelevance or whateverlaugh
balzac had described many cities but hadn't described woollett massachusetts
you say that she returned as if you wanted one immediately to know the worst
oh i think it's a thing he said that you must already have made out
i feel it so that i certainly must look it speak it and as people say there 'act' it
it sticks out of me and you knew surely for yourself as soon as you looked at me
the worst you mean
well the fact of where i come from
there at any rate it is so that you won't be able if anything happens to say i've not been straight with you
i seeand miss gostrey looked really interested in the point he had made
but what do you think of as happening
though he wasn't shywhich was rather anomalousstrether gazed about without meeting her eyes a motion that was frequent with him in talk yet of which his words often seemed not at all the effect
why that you should find me too hopeless
with which they walked on again together while she answered as they went that the most hopeless of her countryfolk were in general precisely those she liked best
all sorts of other pleasant small thingssmall things that were yet large for himflowered in the air of the occasion but the bearing of the occasion itself on matters still remote concerns us too closely to permit us to multiply our illustrations
two or three however in truth we should perhaps regret to lose
the tortuous wallgirdle long since snapped of the little swollen city half held in place by careful civic handswanders in narrow file between parapets smoothed by peaceful generations pausing here and there for a dismantled gate or a bridged gap with rises and drops steps up and steps down queer twists queer contacts peeps into homely streets and under the brows of gables views of cathedral tower and waterside fields of huddled english town and ordered english country
too deep almost for words was the delight of these things to strether yet as deeply mixed with it were certain images of his inward picture
he had trod this walks in the faroff time at twentyfive but that instead of spoiling it only enriched it for present feeling and marked his renewal as a thing substantial enough to share
it was with waymarsh he should have shared it and he was now accordingly taking from him something that was his due
he looked repeatedly at his watch and when he had done so for the fifth time miss gostrey took him up
you're doing something that you think not right
it so touched the place that he quite changed colour and his laugh grew almost awkward
am i enjoying it as much as that
you're not enjoying it i think so much as you ought
i seehe appeared thoughtfully to agree
great is my privilege
oh it's not your privilege
it has nothing to do with me
it has to do with yourself
your failure's general
ah there you are
he laughed
it's the failure of woollett
that's general
the failure to enjoy miss gostrey explained is what i mean
precisely
woollett isn't sure it ought to enjoy
if it were it would
but it hasn't poor thing strether continued any one to show it how
it's not like me
i have somebody
they had stopped in the afternoon sunshineconstantly pausing in their stroll for the sharper sense of what they sawand strether rested on one of the high sides of the old stony groove of the little rampart
he leaned back on this support with his face to the tower of the cathedral now admirably commanded by their station the high redbrown mass square and subordinately spired and crocketed retouched and restored but charming to his longsealed eyes and with the first swallows of the year weaving their flight all round it
miss gostrey lingered near him full of an air to which she more and more justified her right of understanding the effect of things
she quite concurred
you've indeed somebody
and she added  i wish you would let me show you how
oh i'm afraid of you
he cheerfully pleaded
she kept on him a moment through her glasses and through his own a certain pleasant pointedness
ah no you're not
you're not in the least thank goodness
if you had been we shouldn't so soon have found ourselves here together
i think she comfortably concluded you trust me
i think i dobut that's exactly what i'm afraid of
i shouldn't mind if i didn't
it's falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into your hands
i dare say strether continued it's a sort of thing you're thoroughly familiar with but nothing more extraordinary has ever happened to me
she watched him with all her kindness
that means simply that you've recognised mewhich is rather beautiful and rare
you see what i am
as on this however he protested with a goodhumoured headshake a resignation of any such claim she had a moment of explanation
if you'll only come on further as you have come you'll at any rate make out
my own fate has been too many for me and i've succumbed to it
i'm a general guideto 'europe' don't you know
i wait for peoplei put them through
i pick them upi set them down
i'm a sort of superior 'couriermaid'
i'm a companion at large
i take people as i've told you about
i never sought itit has come to me
it has been my fate and one's fate one accepts
it's a dreadful thing to have to say in so wicked a world but i verily believe that such as you see me there's nothing i don't know
i know all the shops and the pricesbut i know worse things still
i bear on my back the huge load of our national consciousness or in other wordsfor it comes to thatof our nation itself
of what is our nation composed but of the men and women individually on my shoulders
i don't do it you know for any particular advantage
i don't do it for instancesome people do you knowfor money
strether could only listen and wonder and weigh his chance
and yet affected as you are then to so many of your clients you can scarcely be said to do it for love
he waited a moment
how do we reward you
she had her own hesitation but you don't
she finally returned setting him again in motion
they went on but in a few minutes though while still thinking over what she had said he once more took out his watch mechanically unconsciously and as if made nervous by the mere exhilaration of what struck him as her strange and cynical wit
he looked at the hour without seeing it and then on something again said by his companion had another pause
you're really in terror of him
he smiled a smile that he almost felt to be sickly
now you can see why i'm afraid of you
because i've such illuminations
why they're all for your help
it's what i told you she added just now
you feel as if this were wrong
he fell back once more settling himself against the parapet as if to hear more about it
then get me out
her face fairly brightened for the joy of the appeal but as if it were a question of immediate action she visibly considered
out of waiting for himof seeing him at all
oh nonot that said poor strether looking grave
i've got to wait for himand i want very much to see him
but out of the terror
you did put your finger on it a few minutes ago
it's general but it avails itself of particular occasions
that's what it's doing for me now
i'm always considering something else something else i mean than the thing of the moment
the obsession of the other thing is the terror
i'm considering at present for instance something else than you
she listened with charming earnestness
oh you oughtn't to do that
it's what i admit
make it then impossible
she continued to think
is it really an 'order' from youthat i shall take the job
will you give yourself up
poor strether heaved his sigh
if i only could
but that's the deuce of itthat i never can
noi can't
she wasn't however discouraged
but you want to at least
oh unspeakably
ah then if you'll try
and she took over the job as she had called it on the spot
trust me
she exclaimed and the action of this as they retraced their steps was presently to make him pass his hand into her arm in the manner of a benign dependent paternal old person who wishes to be nice to a younger one
if he drew it out again indeed as they approached the inn this may have been because after more talk had passed between them the relation of age or at least of experiencewhich for that matter had already played to and fro with some freedomaffected him as incurring a readjustment
it was at all events perhaps lucky that they arrived in sufficiently separate fashion within range of the hoteldoor
the young lady they had left in the glass cage watched as if she had come to await them on the threshold
at her side stood a person equally interested by his attitude in their return and the effect of the sight of whom was instantly to determine for strether another of those responsive arrests that we have had so repeatedly to note
he left it to miss gostrey to name with the fine full bravado as it almost struck him of her mr
waymarsh
what was to have been whathe more than ever felt as his short stare of suspended welcome took things inwould have been but for herself his doom
it was already upon him even at that distancemr waymarsh was for his part joyless
ii  he had none the less to confess to this friend that evening that he knew almost nothing about her and it was a deficiency that waymarsh even with his memory refreshed by contact by her own prompt and lucid allusions and enquiries by their having publicly partaken of dinner in her company and by another stroll to which she was not a stranger out into the town to look at the cathedral by moonlightit was a blank that the resident of milrose though admitting acquaintance with the munsters professed himself unable to fill
he had no recollection of miss gostrey and two or three questions that she put to him about those members of his circle had to strether's observation the same effect he himself had already more directly feltthe effect of appearing to place all knowledge for the time on this original woman's side
it interested him indeed to mark the limits of any such relation for her with his friend as there could possibly be a question of and it particularly struck him that they were to be marked altogether in waymarsh's quarter
this added to his own sense of having gone far with hergave him an early illustration of a much shorter course
there was a certitude he immediately graspeda conviction that waymarsh would quite fail as it were and on whatever degree of acquaintances to profit by her
there had been after the first interchange among the three a talk of some five minutes in the hall and then the two men had adjourned to the garden miss gostrey for the time disappearing
strether in due course accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had before going out scrupulously visited where at the end of another halfhour he had no less discreetly left him
on leaving him he repaired straight to his own room but with the prompt effect of feeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition
there he enjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion
a place was too small for him after it that had seemed large enough before
he had awaited it with something he would have been sorry have been almost ashamed not to recognise as emotion yet with a tacit assumption at the same time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved
the actual oddity was that he was only more excited and his excitementto which indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a namebrought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes vaguely to wander
he went once more to the garden he looked into the public room found miss gostrey writing letters and backed out he roamed fidgeted and wasted time but he was to have his more intimate session with his friend before the evening closed
it was latenot till strether had spent an hour upstairs with himthat this subject consented to betake himself to doubtful rest
dinner and the subsequent stroll by moonlighta dream on strether's part of romantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing of thicker coatshad measurably intervened and this midnight conference was the result of waymarsh's having when they were free as he put it of their fashionable friend found the smokingroom not quite what he wanted and yet bed what he wanted less
his most frequent form of words was that he knew himself and they were applied on this occasion to his certainty of not sleeping
he knew himself well enough to know that he should have a night of prowling unless he should succeed as a preliminary in getting prodigiously tired
if the effort directed to this end involved till a late hour the presence of stretherconsisted that is in the detention of the latter for full discoursethere was yet an impression of minor discipline involved for our friend in the picture waymarsh made as he sat in trousers and shirt on the edge of his couch
with his long legs extended and his large back much bent he nursed alternately for an almost incredible time his elbows and his beard
he struck his visitor as extremely as almost wilfully uncomfortable yet what had this been for strether from that first glimpse of him disconcerted in the porch of the hotel but the predominant notes
the discomfort was in a manner contagious as well as also in a manner inconsequent and unfounded the visitor felt that unless he should get used to itor unless waymarsh himself shouldit would constitute a menace for his own prepared his own already confirmed consciousness of the agreeable
on their first going up together to the room strether had selected for him waymarsh had looked it over in silence and with a sigh that represented for his companion if not the habit of disapprobation at least the despair of felicity and this look had recurred to strether as the key of much he had since observed
europe he had begun to gather from these things had up to now rather failed of its message to him he hadn't got into tune with it and had at the end of three months almost renounced any such expectation
he really appeared at present to insist on that by just perching there with the gas in his eyes
this of itself somehow conveyed the futility of single rectifications in a multiform failure
he had a large handsome head and a large sallow seamed facea striking significant physiognomic total the upper range of which the great political brow the thick loose hair the dark fuliginous eyes recalled even to a generation whose standard had dreadfully deviated the impressive image familiar by engravings and busts of some great national worthy of the earlier part of the midcentury
he was of the personal typeand it was an element in the power and promise that in their early time strether had found in himof the american statesman the statesman trained in congressional halls of an elder day
the legend had been in later years that as the lower part of his face which was weak and slightly crooked spoiled the likeness this was the real reason for the growth of his beard which might have seemed to spoil it for those not in the secret
he shook his mane he fixed with his admirable eyes his auditor or his observer he wore no glasses and had a way partly formidable yet also partly encouraging as from a representative to a constituent of looking very hard at those who approached him
he met you as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter
strether who hadn't seen him for so long an interval apprehended him now with a freshness of taste and had perhaps never done him such ideal justice
the head was bigger the eyes finer than they need have been for the career but that only meant after all that the career was itself expressive
what it expressed at midnight in the gasglaring bedroom at chester was that the subject of it had at the end of years barely escaped by flight in time a general nervous collapse
but this very proof of the full life as the full life was understood at milrose would have made to strether's imagination an element in which waymarsh could have floated easily had he only consented to float
alas nothing so little resembled floating as the rigour with which on the edge of his bed he hugged his posture of prolonged impermanence
it suggested to his comrade something that always when kept up worried hima person established in a railwaycoach with a forward inclination
it represented the angle at which poor waymarsh was to sit through the ordeal of europe
thanks to the stress of occupation the strain of professions the absorption and embarrassment of each they had not at home during years before this sudden brief and almost bewildering reign of comparative ease found so much as a day for a meeting a fact that was in some degree an explanation of the sharpness with which most of his friend's features stood out to strether
those he had lost sight of since the early time came back to him others that it was never possible to forget struck him now as sitting clustered and expectant like a somewhat defiant familygroup on the doorstep of their residence
the room was narrow for its length and the occupant of the bed thrust so far a pair of slippered feet that the visitor had almost to step over them in his recurrent rebounds from his chair to fidget back and forth
there were marks the friends made on things to talk about and on things not to and one of the latter in particular fell like the tap of chalk on the blackboard
married at thirty waymarsh had not lived with his wife for fifteen years and it came up vividly between them in the glare of the gas that strether wasn't to ask about her
he knew they were still separate and that she lived at hotels travelled in europe painted her face and wrote her husband abusive letters of not one of which to a certainty that sufferer spared himself the perusal but he respected without difficulty the cold twilight that had settled on this side of his companion's life
it was a province in which mystery reigned and as to which waymarsh had never spoken the informing word
strether who wanted to do him the highest justice wherever he could do it singularly admired him for the dignity of this reserve and even counted it as one of the groundsgrounds all handled and numberedfor ranking him in the range of their acquaintance as a success
he was a success waymarsh in spite of overwork or prostration of sensible shrinkage of his wife's letters and of his not liking europe
strether would have reckoned his own career less futile had he been able to put into it anything so handsome as so much fine silence
one might one's self easily have left mrs waymarsh and one would assuredly have paid one's tribute to the ideal in covering with that attitude the derision of having been left by her
her husband had held his tongue and had made a large income and these were in especial the achievements as to which strether envied him
our friend had had indeed on his side too a subject for silence which he fully appreciated but it was a matter of a different sort and the figure of the income he had arrived at had never been high enough to look any one in the face
i don't know as i quite see what you require it for
you don't appear sick to speak of
it was of europe waymarsh thus finally spoke
well said strether who fell as much as possible into step i guess i don't feel sick now that i've started
but i had pretty well run down before i did start
waymarsh raised his melancholy look
ain't you about up to your usual average
it was not quite pointedly sceptical but it seemed somehow a plea for the purest veracity and it thereby affected our friend as the very voice of milrose
he had long since made a mental distinctionthough never in truth daring to betray itbetween the voice of milrose and the voice even of woollett
it was the former he felt that was most in the real tradition
there had been occasions in his past when the sound of it had reduced him to temporary confusion and the present for some reason suddenly became such another
it was nevertheless no light matter that the very effect of his confusion should be to make him again prevaricate
that description hardly does justice to a man to whom it has done such a lot of good to see you
waymarsh fixed on his washingstand the silent detached stare with which milrose in person as it were might have marked the unexpectedness of a compliment from woollett and strether for his part felt once more like woollett in person
i mean his friend presently continued that your appearance isn't as bad as i've seen it  it compares favourably with what it was when i last noticed it
on this appearance waymarsh's eyes yet failed to rest it was almost as if they obeyed an instinct of propriety and the effect was still stronger when always considering the basin and jug he added  you've filled out some since then
i'm afraid i have strether laughed  one does fill out some with all one takes in and i've taken in i dare say more than i've natural room for
i was dogtired when i sailed
it had the oddest sound of cheerfulness
i was dogtired his companion returned when i arrived and it's this wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me
the fact is stretherand it's a comfort to have you here at last to say it to though i don't know after all that i've really waited i've told it to people i've met in the carsthe fact is such a country as this ain't my kind of country anyway
there ain't a country i've seen over here that does seem my kind
oh i don't say but what there are plenty of pretty places and remarkable old things but the trouble is that i don't seem to feel anywhere in tune
that's one of the reasons why i suppose i've gained so little
i haven't had the first sign of that lift i was led to expect
with this he broke out more earnestly
look herei want to go back
his eyes were all attached to strether's now for he was one of the men who fully face you when they talk of themselves
this enabled his friend to look at him hard and immediately to appear to the highest advantage in his eyes by doing so
that's a genial thing to say to a fellow who has come out on purpose to meet you
nothing could have been finer on this than waymarsh's sombre glow
have you come out on purpose
wellvery largely
i thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it
strether hesitated
back of my desire to be with you
back of your prostration
strether with a smile made more dim by a certain consciousness shook his head
there are all the causes of it
and no particular cause that seemed most to drive you
our friend could at last conscientiously answer
yes
one
there is a matter that has had much to do with my coming out
waymarsh waited a little
too private to mention
no not too privatefor you
only rather complicated
well said waymarsh who had waited again i may lose my mind over here but i don't know as i've done so yet
oh you shall have the whole thing
but not tonight
waymarsh seemed to sit stiffer and to hold his elbows tighter
why notif i can't sleep
because my dear man i can
then where's your prostration
just in thatthat i can put in eight hours
and strether brought it out that if waymarsh didn't gain it was because he didn't go to bed the result of which was in its order that to do the latter justice he permitted his friend to insist on his really getting settled
strether with a kind coercive hand for it assisted him to this consummation and again found his own part in their relation auspiciously enlarged by the smaller touches of lowering the lamp and seeing to a sufficiency of blanket
it somehow ministered for him to indulgence to feel waymarsh who looked unnaturally big and black in bed as much tucked in as a patient in a hospital and with his covering up to his chin as much simplified by it he hovered in vague pity to be brief while his companion challenged him out of the bedclothes
is she really after you
is that what's behind
strether felt an uneasiness at the direction taken by his companion's insight but he played a little at uncertainty
behind my coming out
behind your prostration or whatever
it's generally felt you know that she follows you up pretty close
strether's candour was never very far off
oh it has occurred to you that i'm literally running away from mrs
newsome
well i haven't known but what you are
you're a very attractive man strether
you've seen for yourself said waymarsh what that lady downstairs makes of it
unless indeed he rambled on with an effect between the ironic and the anxious it's you who are after her
is mrs newsome over here
he spoke as with a droll dread of her
it made his friendthough rather dimlysmile
dear no she's safe thank goodnessas i think i more and more feelat home
she thought of coming but she gave it up
i've come in a manner instead of her and come to that extentfor you're right in your inferenceon her business
so you see there is plenty of connexion
waymarsh continued to see at least all there was
involving accordingly the particular one i've referred to
strether took another turn about the room giving a twitch to his companion's blanket and finally gaining the door
his feeling was that of a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything straight
involving more things than i can think of breaking ground on now
but don't be afraidyou shall have them from me  you'll probably find yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with
i shallif we keep togethervery much depend on your impression of some of them
waymarsh's acknowledgement of this tribute was characteristically indirect
you mean to say you don't believe we will keep together
i only glance at the danger strether paternally said because when i hear you wail to go back i seem to see you open up such possibilities of folly
waymarsh took itsilent a littlelike a large snubbed child what are you going to do with me
it was the very question strether himself had put to miss gostrey and he wondered if he had sounded like that
but he at least could be more definite
i'm going to take you right down to london
oh i've been down to london
waymarsh more softly moaned
i've no use strether for anything down there
well said strether goodhumouredly i guess you've some use for me
so i've got to go
oh you've got to go further yet
well waymarsh sighed do your damnedest
only you will tell me before you lead me on all the way
our friend had again so lost himself both for amusement and for contrition in the wonder of whether he had made in his own challenge that afternoon such another figure that he for an instant missed the thread
tell you
why what you've got on hand
strether hesitated
why it's such a matter as that even if i positively wanted i shouldn't be able to keep it from you
waymarsh gloomily gazed
what does that mean then but that your trip is just for her
for mrs newsome
oh it certainly is as i say
very much
then why do you also say it's for me
strether in impatience violently played with his latch
it's simple enough
it's for both of you
waymarsh at last turned over with a groan
well i won't marry you
neither when it comes to that
but the visitor had already laughed and escaped
iii  he had told miss gostrey he should probably take for departure with waymarsh some afternoon train and it thereupon in the morning appeared that this lady had made her own plan for an earlier one
she had breakfasted when strether came into the coffeeroom but waymarsh not having yet emerged he was in time to recall her to the terms of their understanding and to pronounce her discretion overdone
she was surely not to break away at the very moment she had created a want
he had met her as she rose from her little table in a window where with the morning papers beside her she reminded him as he let her know of major pendennis breakfasting at his cluba compliment of which she professed a deep appreciation and he detained her as pleadingly as if he had alreadyand notably under pressure of the visions of the nightlearned to be unable to do without her
she must teach him at all events before she went to order breakfast as breakfast was ordered in europe and she must especially sustain him in the problem of ordering for waymarsh
the latter had laid upon his friend by desperate sounds through the door of his room dreadful divined responsibilities in respect to beefsteak and orangesresponsibilities which miss gostrey took over with an alertness of action that matched her quick intelligence
she had before this weaned the expatriated from traditions compared with which the matutinal beefsteak was but the creature of an hour and it was not for her with some of her memories to falter in the path though she freely enough declared on reflexion that there was always in such cases a choice of opposed policies
there are times when to give them their head you know
they had gone to wait together in the garden for the dressing of the meal and strether found her more suggestive than ever well what
is to bring about for them such a complexity of relationsunless indeed we call it a simplicitythat the situation has to wind itself up
they want to go back
and you want them to go
strether gaily concluded
i always want them to go and i send them as fast as i can'
oh i knowyou take them to liverpool
any port will serve in a storm
i'mwith all my other functionsan agent for repatriation
i want to repeople our stricken country
what will become of it else
i want to discourage others
the ordered english garden in the freshness of the day  was delightful to strether who liked the sound under his feet of the tight fine gravel packed with the chronic damp and who had the idlest eye for the deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths
other people
other countries
other peopleyes
i want to encourage our own
strether wondered
not to come
why then do you 'meet'  themsince it doesn't appear to be to stop them
oh that they shouldn't come is as yet too much to ask
what i attend to is that they come quickly and return still more so
i meet them to help it to be over as soon as possible  and though i don't stop them i've my way of putting them through
that's my little system and if you want to know  said maria gostrey it's my real secret my innermost mission and use
i only seem you see to beguile and approve but i've thought it all out and i'm working all the while underground
i can't perhaps quite give you my formula but i think that practically i succeed
i send you back spent
so you stay back
passed through my hands  we don't turn up again
the further she went the further he always saw himself able to follow
i don't want your formulai feel quite enough as i hinted yesterday your abysses
spent
he echoed
if that's how you're arranging so subtly to send me i thank you for the warning
for a minute amid the pleasantnesspoetry in tariffed items but all the more for guests already convicted a challenge to consumptionthey smiled at each other in confirmed fellowship
do you call it subtly
it's a plain poor tale
besides you're a special case
oh special casesthat's weak
she was weak enough further still to defer her journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own might a separate carriage mark her independence though it was in spite of this to befall after luncheon that she went off alone and that with a tryst taken for a day of her company in london they lingered another night
she had during the morningspent in a way that he was to remember later on as the very climax of his foretaste as warm with presentiments with what he would have called collapseshad all sorts of things out with strether and among them the fact that though there was never a moment of her life when she wasn't due somewhere there was yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she wasn't capable for his sake
she explained moreover that wherever she happened to be she found a dropped thread to pick up a ragged edge to repair some familiar appetite in ambush jumping out as she approached yet appeasable with a temporary biscuit
it became on her taking the risk of the deviation imposed on him by her insidious arrangement of his morning meal a point of honour for her not to fail with waymarsh of the larger success too and her subsequent boast to strether was that she had made their friend fareand quite without his knowing what was the matteras major pendennis would have fared at the megatherium
she had made him breakfast like a gentleman and it was nothing she forcibly asserted to what she would yet make him do
she made him participate in the slow reiterated ramble with which for strether the new day amply filled itself and it was by her art that he somehow had the air on the ramparts and in the rows of carrying a point of his own
the three strolled and stared and gossiped or at least the two did the case really yielding for their comrade if analysed but the element of stricken silence
this element indeed affected strether as charged with audible rumblings but he was conscious of the care of taking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace
he wouldn't appeal too much for that provoked stiffness yet he wouldn't be too freely tacit for that suggested giving up
waymarsh himself adhered to an ambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a perception or the despair of one and at times and in placeswhere the lowbrowed galleries were darkest the opposite gables queerest the solicitations of every kind densestthe others caught him fixing hard some object of minor interest fixing even at moments nothing discernible as if he were indulging it with a truce
when he met strether's eye on such occasions he looked guilty and furtive fell the next minute into some attitude of retractation
our friend couldn't show him the right things for fear of provoking some total renouncement and was tempted even to show him the wrong in order to make him differ with triumph
there were moments when he himself felt shy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure and there were others when he found himself feeling as if his passages of interchange with the lady at his side might fall upon the third member of their party very much as mr burchell at dr primrose's fireside was influenced by the high flights of the visitors from london
the smallest things so arrested and amused him that he repeatedly almost apologisedbrought up afresh in explanation his plea of a previous grind
he was aware at the same time that his grind had been as nothing to waymarsh's and he repeatedly confessed that to cover his frivolity he was doing his best for his previous virtue
do what he might in any case his previous virtue was still there and it seemed fairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the shops of woollett fairly to make him want things that he shouldn't know what to do with
it was by the oddest the least admissible of laws demoralising him now and the way it boldly took was to make him want more wants
these first walks in europe were in fact a kind of finely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that process
had he come back after long years in something already so like the evening of life only to be exposed to it
it was at all events over the shopwindows that he made with waymarsh most free though it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly yielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades
he pierced with his sombre detachment the plateglass of ironmongers and saddlers while strether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letterpaper and in smart neckties
strether was in fact recurrently shameless in the presence of the tailors though it was just over the heads of the tailors that his countryman most loftily looked
this gave miss gostrey a grasped opportunity to back up waymarsh at his expense
the weary lawyerit was unmistakeablehad a conception of dress but that in view of some of the features of the effect produced was just what made the danger of insistence on it
strether wondered if he by this time thought miss gostrey less fashionable or lambert strether more so and it appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged between this latter pair about passers figures faces personal types exemplified in their degree the disposition to talk as society talked
was what was happening to himself then was what already had happened really that a woman of fashion was floating him into society and that an old friend deserted on the brink was watching the force of the current
when the woman of fashion permitted stretheras she permitted him at the mostthe purchase of a pair of gloves the terms she made about it the prohibition of neckties and other items till she should be able to guide him through the burlington arcade were such as to fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations
miss gostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of vulgar blinking an appointment for the burlington arcade
mere discriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate representalways for such sensitive ears as were in questionpossibilities of something that strether could make a mark against only as the peril of apparent wantonness
he had quite the consciousness of his new friend for their companion that he might have had of a jesuit in petticoats a representative of the recruiting interests of the catholic church
the catholic church for waymarshthat was to say the enemy the monster of bulging eyes and farreaching quivering groping tentacleswas exactly society exactly the multiplication of shibboleths exactly the discrimination of types and tones exactly the wicked old rows of chester rank with feudalism exactly in short europe
there was light for observation however in an incident that occurred just before they turned back to luncheon
waymarsh had been for a quarter of an hour exceptionally mute and distant and something or otherstrether was never to make out exactly whatproved as it were too much for him after his comrades had stood for three minutes taking in while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the row a particularly crooked and huddled streetview
he thinks us sophisticated he thinks us worldly he thinks us wicked he thinks us all sorts of queer things strether reflected for wondrous were the vague quantities our friend had within a couple of short days acquired the habit of conveniently and conclusively lumping together
there seemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a sudden grim dash taken by waymarsh to the opposite side
this movement was startlingly sudden and his companions at first supposed him to have espied to be pursuing the glimpse of an acquaintance
they next made out however that an open door had instantly received him and they then recognised him as engulfed in the establishment of a jeweller behind whose glittering front he was lost to view
the fact had somehow the note of a demonstration and it left each of the others to show a face almost of fear
but miss gostrey broke into a laugh
what's the matter with him
well said strether he can't stand it
but can't stand what
anything
europe
then how will that jeweller help him
strether seemed to make it out from their position between the interstices of arrayed watches of closehung dangling gewgaws
you'll see
ah that's just whatif he buys anythingi'm afraid of  that i shall see something rather dreadful
strether studied the finer appearances
he may buy everything
then don't you think we ought to follow him
not for worlds
besides we can't
we're paralysed
we exchange a long scared look we publicly tremble
the thing is you see we 'realise'
he has struck for freedom
she wondered but she laughed
ah what a price to pay
and i was preparing some for him so cheap
no no strether went on frankly amused now don't call it that the kind of freedom you deal in is dear
then as to justify himself am i not in my way trying it
it's this
being here you mean with me
yes and talking to you as i do
i've known you a few hours and i've known him all my life so that if the ease i thus take with you about him isn't magnificentand the thought of it held him a momentwhy it's rather base
it's magnificent
said miss gostrey to make an end of it
and you should hear she added the ease i takeand i above all intend to takewith mr
waymarsh
strether thought
about me
ah that's no equivalent
the equivalent would be waymarsh's himself serving me uphis remorseless analysis of me
and he'll never do thathe was sadly clear
he'll never remorselessly analyse me
he quite held her with the authority of this
he'll never say a word to you about me
she took it in she did it justice yet after an instant her reason her restless irony disposed of it
of course he won't
for what do you take people that they're able to say words about anything able remorselessly to analyse
there are not many like you and me
it will be only because he's too stupid
it stirred in her friend a sceptical echo which was at the same time the protest of the faith of years
waymarsh stupid
compared with you
strether had still his eyes on the jeweller's front and he waited a moment to answer
he's a success of a kind that i haven't approached
do you mean he has made money
he makes itto my belief
and i said strether though with a back quite as bent have never made anything
i'm a perfectly equipped failure
he feared an instant she'd ask him if he meant he was poor and he was glad she didn't for he really didn't know to what the truth on this unpleasant point mightn't have prompted her
she only however confirmed his assertion
thank goodness you're a failureit's why i so distinguish you
anything else today is too hideous
look about youlook at the successes
would you be one on your honour
look moreover she continued at me
for a little accordingly their eyes met
i see strether returned
you too are out of it
the superiority you discern in me she concurred announces my futility
if you knew she sighed the dreams of my youth
but our realities are what has brought us together
we're beaten brothers in arms
he smiled at her kindly enough but he shook his head
it doesn't alter the fact that you're expensive
you've cost me already
but he had hung fire
cost you what
well my pastin one great lump
but no matter he laughed i'll pay with my last penny
her attention had unfortunately now been engaged by their comrade's return for waymarsh met their view as he came out of his shop
i hope he hasn't paid she said with his last though i'm convinced he has been splendid and has been so for you
ah nonot that
then for me
quite as little
waymarsh was by this time near enough to show signs his friend could read though he seemed to look almost carefully at nothing in particular
then for himself
for nobody
for nothing
for freedom
but what has freedom to do with it
strether's answer was indirect
to be as good as you and me
but different
she had had time to take in their companion's face and with it as such things were easy for her she took in all
differentyes
but better
if waymarsh was sombre he was also indeed almost sublime
he told them nothing left his absence unexplained and though they were convinced he had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to learn its nature
he only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables
it's the sacred rage strether had had further time to say and this sacred rage was to become between them for convenient comprehension the description of one of his periodical necessities
it was strether who eventually contended that it did make him better than they
but by that time miss gostrey was convinced that she didn't want to be better than strether
book second     i   those occasions on which strether was in association with the exile from milrose to see the sacred rage glimmer through would doubtless have their due periodicity but our friend had meanwhile to find names for many other matters
on no evening of his life perhaps as he reflected had he had to supply so many as on the third of his short stay in london an evening spent by miss gostrey's side at one of the theatres to which he had found himself transported without his own hand raised on the mere expression of a conscientious wonder
she knew her theatre she knew her play as she had triumphantly known three days running everything else and the moment filled to the brim for her companion that apprehension of the interesting which whether or no the interesting happened to filter through his guide strained now to its limits his brief opportunity
waymarsh hadn't come with them he had seen plays enough he signified before strether had joined himan affirmation that had its full force when his friend ascertained by questions that he had seen two and a circus
questions as to what he had seen had on him indeed an effect only less favourable than questions as to what he hadn't
he liked the former to be discriminated but how could it be done strether asked of their constant counsellor without discriminating the latter
miss gostrey had dined with him at his hotel face to face over a small table on which the lighted candles had rosecoloured shades and the rosecoloured shades and the small table and the soft fragrance of the ladyhad anything to his mere sense ever been so softwere so many touches in he scarce knew what positive high picture
he had been to the theatre even to the opera in boston with mrs newsome more than once acting as her only escort but there had been no little confronted dinner no pink lights no whiff of vague sweetness as a preliminary one of the results of which was that at present mildly rueful though with a sharpish accent he actually asked himself why there hadn't
there was much the same difference in his impression of the noticed state of his companion whose dress was cut down as he believed the term to be in respect to shoulders and bosom in a manner quite other than mrs newsome's and who wore round her throat a broad red velvet band with an antique jewelhe was rather complacently sure it was antiqueattached to it in front
mrs newsome's dress was never in any degree cut down and she never wore round her throat a broad red velvet band  if she had moreover would it ever have served so to carry on and complicate as he now almost felt his vision
it would have been absurd of him to trace into ramifications the effect of the ribbon from which miss gostrey's trinket depended had he not for the hour at the best been so given over to uncontrolled perceptions
what was it but an uncontrolled perception that his friend's velvet band somehow added in her appearance to the value of every other itemto that of her smile and of the way she carried her head to that of her complexion of her lips her teeth her eyes her hair
what certainly had a man conscious of a man's work in the world to do with red velvet bands
he wouldn't for anything have so exposed himself as to tell miss gostrey how much he liked hers yet he had none the less not only caught himself in the actfrivolous no doubt idiotic and above all unexpectedof liking it  he had in addition taken it as a startingpoint for fresh backward fresh forward fresh lateral flights
the manner in which mrs newsome's throat was encircled suddenly represented for him in an alien order almost as many things as the manner in which miss gostrey's was
mrs newsome wore at operatic hours a black silk dressvery handsome he knew it was handsomeand an ornament that his memory was able further to identify as a ruche
he had his association indeed with the ruche but it was rather imperfectly romantic
he had once said to the wearerand it was as free a remark as he had ever made to herthat she looked with her ruff and other matters like queen elizabeth and it had after this in truth been his fancy that as a consequence of that tenderness and an acceptance of the idea the form of this special tribute to the frill had grown slightly more marked
the connexion as he sat there and let his imagination roam was to strike him as vaguely pathetic but there it all was and pathetic was doubtless in the conditions the best thing it could possibly be
it had assuredly existed at any rate for it seemed now to come over him that no gentleman of his age at woollett could ever to a lady of mrs newsome's which was not much less than his have embarked on such a simile
all sorts of things in fact now seemed to come over him comparatively few of which his chronicler can hope for space to mention
it came over him for instance that miss gostrey looked perhaps like mary stuart  lambert strether had a candour of fancy which could rest for an instant gratified in such an antithesis
it came over him that never beforeno literally neverhad a lady dined with him at a public place before going to the play
the publicity of the place was just in the matter for strether the rare strange thing it affected him almost as the achievement of privacy might have affected a man of a different experience
he had married in the faraway years so young as to have missed the time natural in boston for taking girls to the museum and it was absolutely true of hint thateven after the close of the period of conscious detachment occupying the centre of his life the grey middle desert of the two deaths that of his wife and that ten years later of his boyhe had never taken any one anywhere
it came over him in especialthough the monition had as happened already sounded fitfully gleamed in other formsthat the business he had come out on hadn't yet been so brought home to him as by the sight of the people about him
she gave him the impression his friend at first more straight than he got it for himselfgave it simply by saying with offhand illumination  oh yes they're types
but after he had taken it he made to the full his own use of it both while he kept silence for the four acts and while he talked in the intervals
it was an evening it was a world of types and this was a connexion above all in which the figures and faces in the stalls were interchangeable with those on the stage
he felt as if the play itself penetrated him with the naked elbow of his neighbour a great stripped handsome redhaired lady who conversed with a gentleman on her other side in stray dissyllables which had for his ear in the oddest way in the world so much sound that he wondered they hadn't more sense and he recognised by the same law beyond the footlights what he was pleased to take for the very flush of english life
he had distracted drops in which he couldn't have said if it were actors or auditors who were most true and the upshot of which each time was the consciousness of new contacts
however he viewed his job it was types he should have to tackle
those before him and around him were not as the types of woollett where for that matter it had begun to seem to him that there must only have been the male and the female
these made two exactly even with the individual varieties
here on the other hand apart from the personal and the sexual rangewhich might be greater or lessa series of strong stamps had been applied as it were from without stamps that his observation played with as before a glass case on a table it might have passed from medal to medal and from copper to gold
it befell that in the drama precisely there was a bad woman in a yellow frock who made a pleasant weak goodlooking young man in perpetual evening dress do the most dreadful things
strether felt himself on the whole not afraid of the yellow frock but he was vaguely anxious over a certain kindness into which he found himself drifting for its victim
he hadn't come out he reminded himself to be too kind or indeed to be kind at all to chadwick newsome
would chad also be in perpetual evening dress
he somehow rather hoped itit seemed so to add to this young man's general amenability though he wondered too if to fight him with his own weapons he himself a thought almost startling would have likewise to be
this young man furthermore would have been much more easy to handleat least for himthan appeared probable in respect to chad
it came up for him with miss gostrey that there were things of which she would really perhaps after all have heard and she admitted when a little pressed that she was never quite sure of what she heard as distinguished from things such as on occasions like the present she only extravagantly guessed
i seem with this freedom you see to have guessed mr chad
he's a young man on whose head high hopes are placed at woollett a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom his family over there have sent you out to rescue
you've accepted the mission of separating him from the wicked woman
are you quite sure she's very bad for him
something in his manner showed it as quite pulling him up
of course we are
wouldn't you be
oh i don't know
one never doesdoes onebeforehand
one can only judge on the facts
yours are quite new to me i'm really not in the least as you see in possession of them  so it will be awfully interesting to have them from you
if you're satisfied that's all that's required
i mean if you're sure you are sure sure it won't do
that he should lead such a life
rather
oh but i don't know you see about his life you've not told me about his life
she may be charminghis life
charming
strether stared before him
she's base venalout of the streets
i see
and he
chad wretched boy
of what type and temper is he
she went on as strether had lapsed
wellthe obstinate
it was as if for a moment he had been going to say more and had then controlled himself
that was scarce what she wished
do you like him
this time he was prompt
no
how can i
do you mean because of your being so saddled with him
i'm thinking of his mother said strether after a moment
he has darkened her admirable life
he spoke with austerity
he has worried her half to death
oh that's of course odious
she had a pause as if for renewed emphasis of this truth but it ended on another note
is her life very admirable
extraordinarily
there was so much in the tone that miss gostrey had to devote another pause to the appreciation of it
and has he only her
i don't mean the bad woman in paris she quickly addedfor i assure you i shouldn't even at the best be disposed to allow him more than one
but has he only his mother
he has also a sister older than himself and married and they're both remarkably fine women
very handsome you mean
this promptitudealmost as he might have thought this precipitation gave him a brief drop but he came up again
mrs newsome i think is handsome though she's not of course with a son of twentyeight and a daughter of thirty in her very first youth
she married however extremely young
and is wonderful miss gostrey asked for her age
strether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it
i don't say she's wonderful
or rather he went on the next moment i do say it
it's exactly what she iswonderful
but i wasn't thinking of her appearance he explainedstriking as that doubtless is
i was thinkingwell of many other things
he seemed to look at these as if to mention some of them then took pulling himself up another turn
about mrs pocock people may differ
is that the daughter's name'pocock'
that's the daughter's name strether sturdily confessed
and people may differ you mean about her beauty
about everything
but you admire her
he gave his friend a glance as to show how he could bear this i'm perhaps a little afraid of her
oh said miss gostrey i see her from here
you may say then i see very fast and very far but i've already shown you i do
the young man and the two ladies she went on are at any rate all the family
quite all
his father has been dead ten years and there's no brother nor any other sister
they'd do said strether anything in the world for him
and you'd do anything in the world for them
he shifted again she had made it perhaps just a shade too affirmative for his nerves
oh i don't know
you'd do at any rate this and the 'anything' they'd do is represented by their making you do it
ah they couldn't have comeeither of them
they're very busy people and mrs newsome in particular has a large full life
she's moreover highly nervousand not at all strong
you mean she's an american invalid
he carefully distinguished
there's nothing she likes less than to be called one but she would consent to be one of those things i think he laughed if it were the only way to be the other
consent to be an american in order to be an invalid
no said strether the other way round
she's at any rate delicate sensitive highstrung
she puts so much of herself into everything  ah maria knew these things
that she has nothing left for anything else
of course she hasn't
to whom do you say it
highstrung
don't i spend my life for them jamming down the pedal
i see moreover how it has told on you
strether took this more lightly
oh i jam down the pedal too
well she lucidly returned we must from this moment bear on it together with all our might
and she forged ahead
have they money
but it was as if while her energetic image still held him her enquiry fell short
mrs newsome he wished further to explain hasn't moreover your courage on the question of contact
if she had come it would have been to see the person herself
the woman
ah but that's courage
noit's exaltation which is a very different thing
courage he however accommodatingly threw out is what you have
she shook her head
you say that only to patch me upto cover the nudity of my want of exaltation
i've neither the one nor the other
i've mere battered indifference
i see that what you mean miss gostrey pursued is that if your friend had come she would take great views and the great views to put it simply would be too much for her
strether looked amused at her notion of the simple but he adopted her formula
everything's too much for her
ah then such a service as this of yours  is more for her than anything else
yesfar more
but so long as it isn't too much for me
her condition doesn't matter
surely not we leave her condition out we take it that is for granted
i see it her condition as behind and beneath you yet at the same time i see it as bearing you up
oh it does bear me up
strether laughed
well then as yours bears me nothing more's needed
with which she put again her question
has mrs newsome money
this time he heeded
oh plenty
that's the root of the evil
there's money to very large amounts in the concern
chad has had the free use of a great deal
but if he'll pull himself together and come home all the same he'll find his account in it
she had listened with all her interest
and i hope to goodness you'll find yours
he'll take up his definite material reward said strether without acknowledgement of this
he's at the parting of the ways
he can come into the business nowhe can't come later
is there a business
lord yesa big brave bouncing business
a roaring trade
a great shop
yesa workshop a great production a great industry
the concern's a manufactureand a manufacture that if it's only properly looked after may well be on the way to become a monopoly
it's a little thing they makemake better it appears than other people can or than other people at any rate do
mr newsome being a man of ideas at least in that particular line strether explained put them on it with great effect and gave the place altogether in his time an immense lift
it's a place in itself
well quite a number of buildings almost a little industrial colony
but above all it's a thing
the article produced
and what is the article produced
strether looked about him as in slight reluctance to say then the curtain which he saw about to rise came to his aid
i'll tell you next time
but when the next time came he only said he'd tell her later onafter they should have left the theatre for she had immediately reverted to their topic and even for himself the picture of the stage was now overlaid with another image
his postponements however made her wonderwonder if the article referred to were anything bad
and she explained that she meant improper or ridiculous or wrong
but strether so far as that went could satisfy her
unmentionable
oh no we constantly talk of it we are quite familiar and brazen about it
only as a small trivial rather ridiculous object of the commonest domestic use it's just wanting inwhat shall i say
well dignity or the least approach to distinction
right here therefore with everything about us so grand
in short he shrank
it's a false note
sadly
it's vulgar
but surely not vulgarer than this
then on his wondering as she herself had done  than everything about us
she seemed a trifle irritated
what do you take this for
why forcomparativelydivine
this dreadful london theatre
it's impossible if you really want to know
oh then laughed strether i don't really want to know
it made between them a pause which she however still fascinated by the mystery of the production at woollett presently broke
'rather ridiculous'
clothespins
saleratus
shoepolish
it brought him round
noyou don't even 'burn'
i don't think you know you'll guess it
how then can i judge how vulgar it is
you'll judge when i do tell youand he persuaded her to patience
but it may even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never was to tell her
he actually never did so and it moreover oddly occurred that by the law within her of the incalculable her desire for the information dropped and her attitude to the question converted itself into a positive cultivation of ignorance
in ignorance she could humour her fancy and that proved a useful freedom
she could treat the little nameless object as indeed unnameableshe could make their abstention enormously definite
there might indeed have been for strether the portent of this in what she next said
is it perhaps then because it's so badbecause your industry as you call it is so vulgarthat mr chad won't come back
does he feel the taint
is he staying away not to be mixed up in it
oh strether laughed it wouldn't appearwould itthat he feels 'taints'
he's glad enough of the money from it and the money's his whole basis
there's appreciation in thati mean as to the allowance his mother has hitherto made him
she has of course the resource of cutting this allowance off but even then he has unfortunately and on no small scale his independent supplymoney left him by his grandfather her own father
wouldn't the fact you mention then miss gostrey asked make it just more easy for him to be particular
isn't he conceivable as fastidious about the sourcethe apparent and public sourceof his income
strether was able quite goodhumouredly to entertain the proposition
the source of his grandfather's wealthand thereby of his own share in itwas not particularly noble
and what source was it
strether cast about
wellpractices
in business
infamies
he was an old swindler
oh he said with more emphasis than spirit i shan't describe him nor narrate his exploits
lord what abysses
and the late mr newsome then
well what about him
was he like the grandfather
nohe was on the other side of the house
and he was different
miss gostrey kept it up
better
her friend for a moment hung fire
no
her comment on his hesitation was scarce the less marked for being mute
thank you
now don't you see she went on why the boy doesn't come home
he's drowning his shame
his shame
what shame
what shame
comment donc
the shame
but where and when strether asked is 'the shame'where is any shametoday
the men i speak ofthey did as every one does and besides being ancient history it was all a matter of appreciation
she showed how she understood
mrs newsome has appreciated
ah i can't speak for her
in the midst of such doingsand as i understand you profiting by them she at least has remained exquisite
oh i can't talk of her
strether said
i thought she was just what you could talk of
you don't trust me miss gostrey after a moment declared
it had its effect
well her money is spent her life conceived and carried on with a large beneficence  that's a kind of expiation of wrongs
gracious she added before he could speak how intensely you make me see her
if you see her strether dropped it's all that's necessary
she really seemed to have her
i feel that
she is in spite of everything handsome
this at least enlivened him
what do you mean by everything
well i mean you
with which she had one of her swift changes of ground
you say the concern needs looking after  but doesn't mrs newsome look after it
so far as possible
she's wonderfully able but it's not her affair and her life's a good deal overcharged
she has many many things
and you also
oh yesi've many too if you will
i see
but what i mean is miss gostrey amended do you also look after the business
oh no i don't touch the business
only everything else
well yessome things
as for instance
strether obligingly thought
well the review
the reviewyou have a review
certainly
woollett has a reviewwhich mrs newsome for the most part magnificently pays for and which i not at all magnificently edit
my name's on the cover strether pursued and i'm really rather disappointed and hurt that you seem never to have heard of it
she neglected for a moment this grievance
and what kind of a review is it
his serenity was now completely restored
well it's green
do you mean in political colour as they say herein thought
no i mean the cover's greenof the most lovely shade
and with mrs newsome's name on it too
he waited a little
oh as for that you must judge if she peeps out
she's behind the whole thing but she's of a delicacy and a discretion
miss gostrey took it all
i'm sure
she would be
i don't underrate her
she must be rather a swell
oh yes she's rather a swell
a woollett swellbon
i like the idea of a woollett swell
and you must be rather one too to be so mixed up with her
ah no said strether that's not the way it works
but she had already taken him up
the way it worksyou needn't tell meis of course that you efface yourself
with my name on the cover
he lucidly objected
ah but you don't put it on for yourself
i beg your pardonthat's exactly what i do put it on for
it's exactly the thing that i'm reduced to doing for myself
it seems to rescue a little you see from the wreck of hopes and ambitions the refuseheap of disappointments and failures  my one presentable little scrap of an identity
on this she looked at him as to say many things but what she at last simply said was  she likes to see it there
you're the bigger swell of the two she immediately continued  because you think you're not one
she thinks she is one
however miss gostrey added she thinks you're one too
you're at all events the biggest she can get hold of
she embroidered she abounded
i don't say it to interfere between you but on the day she gets hold of a bigger one
strether had thrown back his head as in silent mirth over something that struck him in her audacity or felicity and her flight meanwhile was already higher
therefore close with her
close with her
he asked as she seemed to hang poised
before you lose your chance
their eyes met over it
what do you mean by closing
and what do i mean by your chance
i'll tell you when you tell me all the things you don't
is it her greatest fad
she briskly pursued
the review
he seemed to wonder how he could best describe it
this resulted however but in a sketch
it's her tribute to the ideal
i see
you go in for tremendous things
we go in for the unpopular sidethat is so far as we dare
and how far do you dare
well she very far
i much less
i don't begin to have her faith
she provides said strether three fourths of that
and she provides as i've confided to you all the money
it evoked somehow a vision of gold that held for a little miss gostrey's eyes and she looked as if she heard the bright dollars shovelled in
i hope then you make a good thing  i never made a good thing
he at once returned
she just waited
don't you call it a good thing to be loved
oh we're not loved
we're not even hated
we're only just sweetly ignored
she had another pause
you don't trust me
she once more repeated
don't i when i lift the last veiltell you the very secret of the prisonhouse
again she met his eyes but to the result that after an instant her own turned away with impatience
you don't sell
oh i'm glad of that
after which however and before he could protest she was off again
she's just a moral swell
he accepted gaily enough the definition
yesi really think that describes her
but it had for his friend the oddest connexion
how does she do her hair
he laughed out
beautifully
ah that doesn't tell me
however it doesn't matteri know
it's tremendously neata real reproach quite remarkably thick and without as yet a single strand of white
there
he blushed for her realism but gaped at her truth
you're the very deuce
what else should i be
it was as the very deuce i pounced on you
but don't let it trouble you for everything but the very deuceat our ageis a bore and a delusion and even he himself after all but half a joy
with which on a single sweep of her wing she resumed
you assist her to expiatewhich is rather hard when you've yourself not sinned
it's she who hasn't sinned strether replied
i've sinned the most
ah miss gostrey cynically laughed what a picture of her
have you robbed the widow and the orphan
i've sinned enough said strether
enough for whom
enough for what
well to be where i am
thank you
they were disturbed at this moment by the passage between their knees and the back of the seats before them of a gentleman who had been absent during a part of the performance and who now returned for the close but the interruption left miss gostrey time before the subsequent hush to express as a sharp finality her sense of the moral of all their talk
i knew you had something up your sleeve
this finality however left them in its turn at the end of the play as disposed to hang back as if they had still much to say so that they easily agreed to let every one go before themthey found an interest in waiting
they made out from the lobby that the night had turned to rain yet miss gostrey let her friend know that he wasn't to see her home
he was simply to put her by herself into a fourwheeler she liked so in london of wet nights after wild pleasures thinking things over on the return in lonely fourwheelers
this was her great time she intimated for pulling herself together
the delays caused by the weather the struggle for vehicles at the door gave them occasion to subside on a divan at the back of the vestibule and just beyond the reach of the fresh damp gusts from the street
here strether's comrade resumed that free handling of the subject to which his own imagination of it already owed so much
does your young friend in paris like you
it had almost after the interval startled him
oh i hope not
why should he
why shouldn't he
miss gostrey asked
that you're coming down on him need have nothing to do with it
you see more in it he presently returned than i
of course i see you in it
well then you see more in 'me'
than you see in yourself
very likely
that's always one's right
what i was thinking of she explained is the possible particular effect on him of his milieu
oh his milieu
strether really felt he could imagine it better now than three hours before
do you mean it can only have been so lowering
why that's my very startingpoint
yes but you start so far back
what do his letters say
nothing
he practically ignores usor spares us
he doesn't write
i see
but there are all the same she went on two quite distinct things thatgiven the wonderful place he's inmay have happened to him
one is that he may have got brutalised
the other is that he may have got refined
strether staredthis was a novelty
refined
oh she said quietly there are refinements
the way of it made him after looking at her break into a laugh
you have them
as one of the signs she continued in the same tone they constitute perhaps the worst
he thought it over and his gravity returned
is it a refinement not to answer his mother's letters
she appeared to have a scruple but she brought it out
oh i should say the greatest of all
well said strether i'm quite content to let it as one of the signs pass for the worst that i know he believes he can do what he likes with me
this appeared to strike her
how do you know it
oh i'm sure of it
i feel it in my bones
feel he can do it
feel that he believes he can
it may come to the same thing
strether laughed
she wouldn't however have this
nothing for you will ever come to the same thing as anything else
and she understood what she meant it seemed sufficiently to go straight on
you say that if he does break he'll come in for things at home
quite positively
he'll come in for a particular chancea chance that any properly constituted young man would jump at
the business has so developed that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago but which his father's will took account of as in certain conditions possible and which under that will attaches to chad's availing himself of it a large contingent advantagethis opening the conditions having come about now simply awaits him
his mother has kept it for him holding out against strong pressure till the last possible moment
it requires naturally as it carries with it a handsome 'part' a large share in profits his being on the spot and making a big effort for a big result
that's what i mean by his chance
if he misses it he comes in as you say for nothing
and to see that he doesn't miss it is in a word what i've come out for
she let it all sink in
what you've come out for then is simply to render him an immense service
well poor strether was willing to take it so
ah if you like
he stands as they say if you succeed with him to gain  oh a lot of advantages
strether had them clearly at his fingers' ends
by which you mean of course a lot of money
well not only
i'm acting with a sense for him of other things too
consideration and comfort and securitythe general safety of being anchored by a strong chain
he wants as i see him to be protected
protected i mean from life
ah voila
her thought fitted with a click
from life
what you really want to get him home for is to marry him
well that's about the size of it
of course she said it's rudimentary
but to any one in particular
he smiled at this looking a little more conscious
you get everything out
for a moment again their eyes met
you put everything in
he acknowledged the tribute by telling her
to mamie pocock
she wondered then gravely even exquisitely as if to make the oddity also fit  his own niece
oh you must yourself find a name for the relation
his brotherinlaw's sister
mrs jim's sisterinlaw
it seemed to have on miss gostrey a certain hardening effect
and who in the world's mrs
jim
chad's sisterwho was sarah newsome
she's marrieddidn't i mention itto jim pocock
ah yes she tacitly replied but he had mentioned things
then however with all the sound it could have who in the world's jim pocock
she asked
why sally's husband
that's the only way we distinguish people at woollett he goodhumoredly explained
and is it a great distinctionbeing sally's husband
he considered
i think there can be scarcely a greaterunless it may become one in the future to be chad's wife
then how do they distinguish you
they don'texcept as i've told you by the green cover
once more their eyes met on it and she held him an instant
the green cover won'tnor will any coveravail you with me
you're of a depth of duplicity
still she could in her own large grasp of the real condone it
is mamie a great parti
oh the greatest we haveour prettiest brightest girl
miss gostrey seemed to fix the poor child
i know what they can be
and with money
not perhaps with a great deal of thatbut with so much of everything else that we don't miss it
we don't miss money much you know strether added in general in america in pretty girls
no she conceded but i know also what you do sometimes miss
and do you she asked yourself admire her
it was a question he indicated that there might be several ways of taking but he decided after an instant for the humorous
haven't i sufficiently showed you how i admire any pretty girl
her interest in his problem was by this time such that it scarce left her freedom and she kept close to the facts
i supposed that at woollett you wanted themwhat shall i call itblameless
i mean your young men for your pretty girls
so did i
strether confessed
but you strike there a curious factthe fact that woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness of manners
everything changes and i hold that our situation precisely marks a date
we should prefer them blameless but we have to make the best of them as we find them
since the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so much more to paris  you've to take them back as they come
when they do come
bon
once more she embraced it all but she had a moment of thought
poor chad
ah said strether cheerfully mamie will save him
she was looking away still in her vision and she spoke with impatience and almost as if he hadn't understood her
you'll save him
that's who'll save him
oh but with mamie's aid
unless indeed you mean he added that i shall effect so much more with yours
it made her at last again look at him
you'll do moreas you're so much betterthan all of us put together
i think i'm only better since i've known you
strether bravely returned
the depletion of the place the shrinkage of the crowd and now comparatively quiet withdrawal of its last elements had already brought them nearer the door and put them in relation with a messenger of whom he bespoke miss gostrey's cab
but this left them a few minutes more which she was clearly in no mood not to use
you've spoken to me of whatby your successmr chad stands to gain
but you've not spoken to me of what you do
oh i've nothing more to gain said strether very simply
she took it as even quite too simple
you mean you've got it all 'down'
you've been paid in advance
ah don't talk about payment
he groaned
something in the tone of it pulled her up but as their messenger still delayed she had another chance and she put it in another way
whatby failuredo you stand to lose
he still however wouldn't have it
nothing
he exclaimed and on the messenger's at this instant reappearing he was able to sink the subject in their responsive advance
when a few steps up the street under a lamp he had put her into her fourwheeler and she had asked him if the man had called for him no second conveyance he replied before the door was closed
you won't take me with you
not for the world
then i shall walk
in the rain
i like the rain said strether
goodnight
she kept him a moment while his hand was on the door by not answering after which she answered by repeating her question
what do you stand to lose
why the question now affected him as other he couldn't have said he could only this time meet it otherwise
everything
so i thought
then you shall succeed
and to that end i'm yours  ah dear lady
he kindly breathed
till death
said maria gostrey
goodnight
ii   strether called his second morning in paris on the bankers of the rue scribe to whom his letter of credit was addressed and he made this visit attended by waymarsh in whose company he had crossed from london two days before
they had hastened to the rue scribe on the morrow of their arrival but strether had not then found the letters the hope of which prompted this errand
he had had as yet none at all hadn't expected them in london but had counted on several in paris and disconcerted now had presently strolled back to the boulevard with a sense of injury that he felt himself taking for as good a start as any other
it would serve this spur to his spirit he reflected as pausing at the top of the street he looked up and down the great foreign avenue it would serve to begin business with
his idea was to begin business immediately and it did much for him the rest of his day that the beginning of business awaited him
he did little else till night but ask himself what he should do if he hadn't fortunately had so much to do but he put himself the question in many different situations and connexions
what carried him hither and yon was an admirable theory that nothing he could do wouldn't be in some manner related to what he fundamentally had on hand or would beshould he happen to have a scruplewasted for it
he did happen to have a scruplea scruple about taking no definite step till he should get letters but this reasoning carried it off
a single day to feel his feethe had felt them as yet only at chester and in londonwas he could consider none too much and having as he had often privately expressed it paris to reckon with he threw these hours of freshness consciously into the reckoning
they made it continually greater but that was what it had best be if it was to be anything at all and he gave himself up till far into the evening at the theatre and on the return after the theatre along the bright congested boulevard to feeling it grow
waymarsh had accompanied him this time to the play and the two men had walked together as a first stage from the gymnase to the cafe riche into the crowded terrace of which establishmentthe night or rather the morning for midnight had struck being bland and populousthey had wedged themselves for refreshment
waymarsh as a result of some discussion with his friend had made a marked virtue of his having now let himself go and there had been elements of impression in their halfhour over their watered beerglasses that gave him his occasion for conveying that he held this compromise with his stiffer self to have become extreme
he conveyed itfor it was still after all his stiffer self who gloomed out of the glare of the terracein solemn silence and there was indeed a great deal of critical silence every way between the companions even till they gained the place de l'opera as to the character of their nocturnal progress
this morning there were lettersletters which had reached london apparently all together the day of strether's journey and had taken their time to follow him so that after a controlled impulse to go into them in the receptionroom of the bank which reminding him of the postoffice at woollett affected him as the abutment of some transatlantic bridge he slipped them into the pocket of his loose grey overcoat with a sense of the felicity of carrying them off
waymarsh who had had letters yesterday had had them again today and waymarsh suggested in this particular no controlled impulses
the last one he was at all events likely to be observed to struggle with was clearly that of bringing to a premature close any visit to the rue scribe
strether had left him there yesterday he wanted to see the papers and he had spent by what his friend could make out a succession of hours with the papers
he spoke of the establishment with emphasis as a post of superior observation just as he spoke generally of his actual damnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on
europe was best described to his mind as an elaborate engine for dissociating the confined american from that indispensable knowledge and was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations of relief traps for the arrest of wandering western airs
strether on his side set himself to walk againhe had his relief in his pocket and indeed much as he had desired his budget the growth of restlessness might have been marked in him from the moment he had assured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it contained
this restlessness became therefore his temporary law he knew he should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for settling down with his chief correspondent
he had for the next hour an accidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops he came down the rue de la paix in the sun and passing across the tuileries and the river indulged more than onceas if on finding himself determinedin a sudden pause before the bookstalls of the opposite quay
in the garden of the tuileries he had lingered on two or three spots to look it was as if the wonderful paris spring had stayed him as he roamed
the prompt paris morning struck its cheerful notesin a soft breeze and a sprinkled smell in the light flit over the gardenfloor of bareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong boxes in the type of ancient thrifty persons basking betimes where terracewalls were warm in the bluefrocked brasslabelled officialism of humble rakers and scrapers in the deep references of a straightpacing priest or the sharp ones of a whitegaitered redlegged soldier
he watched little brisk figures figures whose movement was as the tick of the great paris clock take their smooth diagonal from point to point the air had a taste as of something mixed with art something that presented nature as a whitecapped masterchef
the palace was gone strether remembered the palace and when he gazed into the irremediable void of its site the historic sense in him might have been freely at playthe play under which in paris indeed it so often winces like a touched nerve
he filled out spaces with dim symbols of scenes he caught the gleam of white statues at the base of which with his letters out he could tilt back a strawbottomed chair
but his drift was for reasons to the other side and it floated him unspent up the rue de seine and as far as the luxembourg
in the luxembourg gardens he pulled up here at last he found his nook and here on a penny chair from which terraces alleys vistas fountains little trees in green tubs little women in white caps and shrill little girls at play all sunnily composed together he passed an hour in which the cup of his impressions seemed truly to overflow
but a week had elapsed since he quitted the ship and there were more things in his mind than so few days could account for
more than once during the time he had regarded himself as admonished but the admonition this morning was formidably sharp
it took as it hadn't done yet the form of a questionthe question of what he was doing with such an extraordinary sense of escape
this sense was sharpest after he had read his letters but that was also precisely why the question pressed
four of the letters were from mrs newsome and none of them short she had lost no time had followed on his heels while he moved so expressing herself that he now could measure the probable frequency with which he should hear
they would arrive it would seem her communications at the rate of several a week he should be able to count it might even prove on more than one by each mail
if he had begun yesterday with a small grievance he had therefore an opportunity to begin today with its opposite
he read the letters successively and slowly putting others back into his pocket but keeping these for a long time afterwards gathered in his lap
he held them there lost in thought as if to prolong the presence of what they gave him or as if at the least to assure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity
his friend wrote admirably and her tone was even more in her style than in her voicehe might almost for the hour have had to come this distance to get its full carrying quality yet the plentitude of his consciousness of difference consorted perfectly with the deepened intensity of the connexion
it was the difference the difference of being just where he was and as he was that formed the escapethis difference was so much greater than he had dreamed it would be and what he finally sat there turning over was the strange logic of his finding himself so free
he felt it in a manner his duty to think out his state to approve the process and when he came in fact to trace the steps and add up the items they sufficiently accounted for the sum
he had never expectedthat was the truth of itagain to find himself young and all the years and other things it had taken to make him so were exactly his present arithmetic
he had to make sure of them to put his scruple to rest
it all sprang at bottom from the beauty of mrs newsome's desire that he should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his task by insisting that he should thoroughly intermit and break she had so provided for his freedom that she would as it were have only herself to thank
strether could not at this point indeed have completed his thought by the image of what she might have to thank herself for  the image at best of his own likenesspoor lambert strether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day poor lambert strether thankful for breathingtime and stiffening himself while he gasped
there he was and with nothing in his aspect or his posture to scandalise it was only true that if he had seen mrs newsome coming he would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a little
he would have come round and back to her bravely but he would have had first to pull himself together
she abounded in news of the situation at home proved to him how perfectly she was arranging for his absence told him who would take up this and who take up that exactly where he had left it gave him in fact chapter and verse for the moral that nothing would suffer
it filled for him this tone of hers all the air yet it struck him at the same time as the hum of vain things
this latter effect was what he tried to justifyand with the success that grave though the appearance he at last lighted on a form that was happy
he arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of his having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men
if ever a man had come off tired lambert strether was that man and hadn't it been distinctly on the ground of his fatigue that his wonderful friend at home had so felt for him and so contrived
it seemed to him somehow at these instants that could he only maintain with sufficient firmness his grasp of that truth it might become in a manner his compass and his helm
what he wanted most was some idea that would simplify and nothing would do this so much as the fact that he was done for and finished
if it had been in such a light that he had just detected in his cup the dregs of youth that was a mere flaw of the surface of his scheme
he was so distinctly faggedout that it must serve precisely as his convenience and if he could but consistently be good for little enough he might do everything he wanted
everything he wanted was comprised moreover in a single boonthe common unattainable art of taking things as they came
he appeared to himself to have given his best years to an active appreciation of the way they didn't come but perhapsas they would seemingly here be things quite otherthis long ache might at last drop to rest
he could easily see that from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed collapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories
oh if he should do the sum no slate would hold the figures
the fact that he had failed as he considered in everything in each relation and in half a dozen trades as he liked luxuriously to put it might have made might still make for an empty present but it stood solidly for a crowded past
it had not been so much achievement missed a light yoke nor a short load
it was at present as if the backward picture had hung there the long crooked course grey in the shadow of his solitude
it had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude a solitude of life or choice of community but though there had been people enough all round it there had been but three or four persons in it
waymarsh was one of these and the fact struck him just now as marking the record
mrs newsome was another and miss gostrey had of a sudden shown signs of becoming a third
beyond behind them was the pale figure of his real youth which held against its breast the two presences paler than itselfthe young wife he had early lost and the young son he had stupidly sacrificed
he had again and again made out for himself that he might have kept his little boy his little dull boy who had died at school of rapid diphtheria if he had not in those years so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother
it was the soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not really been dullhad been dull as he had been banished and neglected mainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish
this was doubtless but the secret habit of sorrow which had slowly given way to time yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit at the sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up wince with the thought of an opportunity lost
had ever a man he had finally fallen into the way of asking himself lost so much and even done so much for so little
there had been particular reasons why all yesterday beyond other days he should have had in one ear this cold enquiry
his name on the green cover where he had put it for mrs newsome expressed him doubtless just enough to make the worldthe world as distinguished both for more and for less from woollettask who he was
he had incurred the ridicule of having to have his explanation explained
he was lambert strether because he was on the cover whereas it should have been for anything like glory that he was on the cover because he was lambert strether
he would have done anything for mrs newsome have been still more ridiculousas he might for that matter have occasion to be yet which came to saying that this acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fiftyfive
he judged the quantity as small because it was small and all the more egregiously since it couldn't as he saw the case so much as thinkably have been larger
he hadn't had the gift of making the most of what he tried and if he had tried and tried againno one but himself knew how oftenit appeared to have been that he might demonstrate what else in default of that could be made
old ghosts of experiments came back to him old drudgeries and delusions and disgusts old recoveries with their relapses old fevers with their chills broken moments of good faith others of still better doubt adventures for the most part of the sort qualified as lessons
the special spring that had constantly played for him the day before was the recognitionfrequent enough to surprise himof the promises to himself that he had after his other visit never kept
the reminiscence today most quickened for him was that of the vow taken in the course of the pilgrimage that newlymarried with the war just over and helplessly young in spite of it he had recklessly made with the creature who was so much younger still
it had been a bold dash for which they had taken money set apart for necessities but kept sacred at the moment in a hundred ways and in none more so than by this private pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed with the higher culture and see that as they said at woollett it should bear a good harvest
he had believed sailing home again that he had gained something great and his theorywith an elaborate innocent plan of reading digesting coming back even every few yearshad then been to preserve cherish and extend it
as such plans as these had come to nothing however in respect to acquisitions still more precious it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he should have lost account of that handful of seed
buried for long years in dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under fortyeight hours of paris
the process of yesterday had really been the process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long since individually dropped
strether had become acquainted even on this ground with short gusts of speculationsudden flights of fancy in louvre galleries hungry gazes through clear plates behind which lemoncoloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree
there were instants at which he could ask whether since there had been fundamentally so little question of his keeping anything the fate after all decreed for him hadn't been only to be kept
kept for something in that event that he didn't pretend didn't possibly dare as yet to divine something that made him hover and wonder and laugh and sigh made him advance and retreat feeling half ashamed of his impulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his impulse to wait
he remembered for instance how he had gone back in the sixties with lemoncoloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a dozenselected for his wife tooin his trunk and nothing had at the moment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste
they were still somewhere at home the dozenstale and soiled and never sent to the binder but what had become of the sharp initiation they represented
they represented now the mere sallow paint on the door of the temple of taste that he had dreamed of raising upa structure he had practically never carried further
strether's present highest flights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse figured to him as a symbol a symbol of his long grind and his want of odd moments his want moreover of money of opportunity of positive dignity
that the memory of the vow of his youth should in order to throb again have had to wait for this last as he felt it of all his accidentsthat was surely proof enough of how his conscience had been encumbered
if any further proof were needed it would have been to be found in the fact that as he perfectly now saw he had ceased even to measure his meagreness a meagreness that sprawled in this retrospect vague and comprehensive stretching back like some unmapped hinterland from a rough coastsettlement
his conscience had been amusing itself for the fortyeight hours by forbidding him the purchase of a book he held off from that held off from everything from the moment he didn't yet call on chad he wouldn't for the world have taken any other step
on this evidence however of the way they actually affected him he glared at the lemoncoloured covers in confession of the subconsciousness that all the same in the great desert of the years he must have had of them
the green covers at home comprised by the law of their purpose no tribute to letters it was of a mere rich kernel of economics politics ethics that glazed and as mrs newsome maintained rather against his view preeminently pleasant to touch they formed the specious shell
without therefore any needed instinctive knowledge of what was coming out in paris on the bright highway he struck himself at present as having more than once flushed with a suspicion  he couldn't otherwise at present be feeling so many fears confirmed
there were movements he was too late for weren't they with the fun of them already spent
there were sequences he had missed and great gaps in the procession  he might have been watching it all recede in a golden cloud of dust
if the playhouse wasn't closed his seat had at least fallen to somebody else
he had had an uneasy feeling the night before that if he was at the theatre at allthough he indeed justified the theatre in the specific sense and with a grotesqueness to which his imagination did all honour as something he owed poor waymarshhe should have been there with and as might have been said for chad
this suggested the question of whether he could properly have taken him to such a play and what effectit was a point that suddenly rosehis peculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his choice of entertainment
it had literally been present to him at the gymnasewhere one was held moreover comparatively safethat having his young friend at his side would have been an odd feature of the work of redemption and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture presented might well confronted with chad's own private stage have seemed the pattern of propriety
he clearly hadn't come out in the name of propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances yet still less had he done so to undermine his authority by sharing them with the graceless youth
was he to renounce all amusement for the sweet sake of that authority
and would such renouncement give him for chad a moral glamour
the little problem bristled the more by reason of poor strether's fairly open sense of the irony of things
were there then sides on which his predicament threatened to look rather droll to him
should he have to pretend to believeeither to himself or the wretched boythat there was anything that could make the latter worse
wasn't some such pretence on the other hand involved in the assumption of possible processes that would make him better
his greatest uneasiness seemed to peep at him out of the imminent impression that almost any acceptance of paris might give one's authority away
it hung before him this morning the vast bright babylon like some huge iridescent object a jewel brilliant and hard in which parts were not to be discriminated nor differences comfortably marked
it twinkled and trembled and melted together and what seemed all surface one moment seemed all depth the next
it was a place of which unmistakeably chad was fond wherefore if he strether should like it too much what on earth with such a bond would become of either of them
it all depended of coursewhich was a gleam of lighton how the too much was measured though indeed our friend fairly felt while he prolonged the meditation i describe that for himself even already a certain measure had been reached
it will have been sufficiently seen that he was not a man to neglect any good chance for reflexion
was it at all possible for instance to like paris enough without liking it too much
he luckily however hadn't promised mrs newsome not to like it at all
he was ready to recognise at this stage that such an engagement would have tied his hands
the luxembourg gardens were incontestably just so adorable at this hour by reasonin addition to their intrinsic charmof his not having taken it
the only engagement he had taken when he looked the thing in the face was to do what he reasonably could
it upset him a little none the less and after a while to find himself at last remembering on what current of association he had been floated so far
old imaginations of the latin quarter had played their part for him and he had duly recalled its having been with this scene of rather ominous legend that like so many young men in fiction as well as in fact chad had begun
he was now quite out of it with his home as strether figured the place in the boulevard malesherbes which was perhaps why repairing not to fail of justice either to the elder neighbourhood our friend had felt he could allow for the element of the usual the immemorial without courting perturbation
he was not at least in danger of seeing the youth and the particular person flaunt by together and yet he was in the very air of whichjust to feel what the early natural note must have beenhe wished most to take counsel
it became at once vivid to him that he had originally had for a few days an almost envious vision of the boy's romantic privilege
melancholy murger with francine and musette and rodolphe at home in the company of the tattered oneif he not in his single self two or threeof the unbound the papercovered dozen on the shelf and when chad had written five years ago after a sojourn then already prolonged to six months that he had decided to go in for economy and the real thing strether's fancy had quite fondly accompanied him in this migration which was to convey him as they somewhat confusedly learned at woollett across the bridges and up the montagne saintegenevieve
this was the regionchad had been quite distinct about itin which the best french and many other things were to be learned at least cost and in which all sorts of clever fellows compatriots there for a purpose formed an awfully pleasant set
the clever fellows the friendly countrymen were mainly young painters sculptors architects medical students but they were chad sagely opined a much more profitable lot to be witheven on the footing of not being quite one of themthan the terrible toughs strether remembered the edifying discrimination of the american bars and banks roundabout the opera
chad had thrown out in the communications following this onefor at that time he did once in a while communicatethat several members of a band of earnest workers under one of the great artists had taken him right in making him dine every night almost for nothing at their place and even pressing him not to neglect the hypothesis of there being as much in him as in any of them
there had been literally a moment at which it appeared there might be something in him there had been at any rate a moment at which he had written that he didn't know but what a month or two more might see him enrolled in some atelier
the season had been one at which mrs newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies it had broken on them all as a blessing that their absentee had perhaps a consciencethat he was sated in fine with idleness was ambitious of variety
the exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant but strether himself even by that time much enlisted and immersed had determined on the part of the two ladies a temperate approval and in fact as he now recollected a certain austere enthusiasm
but the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the curtain
the son and brother had not browsed long on the montagne saintegenevievehis effective little use of the name of which like his allusion to the best french appeared to have been but one of the notes of his rough cunning
the light refreshment of these vain appearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far
on the other hand it had gained chad time it had given him a chance unchecked to strike his roots had paved the way for initiations more direct and more deep
it was strether's belief that he had been comparatively innocent before this first migration and even that the first effects of the migration would not have been without some particular bad accident to have been deplored
there had been three monthshe had sufficiently figured it outin which chad had wanted to try
he had tried though not very hardhe had had his little hour of good faith
the weakness of this principle in him was that almost any accident attestedly bad enough was stronger
such had at any rate markedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of impressions
they had proved successively these impressionsall of musette and francine but musette and francine vulgarised by the larger evolution of the typeirresistibly sharp  he had taken up by what was at the time to be shrinkingly gathered as it was scantly mentioned with one ferociously interested little person after another
strether had read somewhere of a latin motto a description of the hours observed on a clock by a traveller in spain and he had been led to apply it in thought to chad's number one number two number three
omnes vulnerant ultima necatthey had all morally wounded the last had morally killed
the last had been longest in possessionin possession that is of whatever was left of the poor boy's finer mortality
and it hadn't been she it had been one of her early predecessors who had determined the second migration the expensive return and relapse the exchange again as was fairly to be presumed of the vaunted best french for some special variety of the worst
he pulled himself then at last together for his own progress back not with the feeling that he had taken his walk in vain
he prolonged it a little in the immediate neighbourhood after he had quitted his chair and the upshot of the whole morning for him was that his campaign had begun
he had wanted to put himself in relation and he would be hanged if he were not in relation
he was that at no moment so much as while under the old arches of the odeon he lingered before the charming openair array of literature classic and casual
he found the effect of tone and tint in the long charged tables and shelves delicate and appetising the impressionsubstituting one kind of lowpriced consommation for anothermight have been that of one of the pleasant cafes that overlapped under an awning to the pavement but he edged along grazing the tables with his hands firmly behind him
he wasn't there to dip to consumehe was there to reconstruct
he wasn't there for his own profitnot that is the direct he was there on some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of youth
he felt it in fact he had it beside him the old arcade indeed as his inner sense listened gave out the faint sound as from far off of the wild waving of wings
they were folded now over the breasts of buried generations but a flutter or two lived again in the turned page of shockheaded slouchhatted loiterers whose young intensity of type in the direction of pale acuteness deepened his vision and even his appreciation of racial differences and whose manipulation of the uncut volume was too often however but a listening at closed doors
he reconstructed a possible groping chad of three or four years before a chad who had after all simplyfor that was the only way to see itbeen too vulgar for his privilege
surely it was a privilege to have been young and happy just there
well the best thing strether knew of him was that he had had such a dream
but his own actual business half an hour later was with a third floor on the boulevard malesherbesso much as that was definite and the fact of the enjoyment by the thirdfloor windows of a continuous balcony to which he was helped by this knowledge had perhaps something to do with his lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street
there were points as to which he had quite made up his mind and one of these bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events had finally committed him a policy that he was pleased to find not at all shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered
he had announced himselfsix months before had written out at least that chad wasn't to be surprised should he see him some day turn up
chad had thereupon in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer offered him a general welcome and strether ruefully reflecting that he might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality a bid for an invitation had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most to his own taste
he had asked mrs newsome moreover not to announce him again he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job should he attack it at all in his own way
not the least of this lady's high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her word
she was the only woman he had known even at woollett as to whom his conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art
sarah pocock for instance her own daughter though with social ideals as they said in some respects differentsarah who was in her way aesthetic had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of rigour there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it
since accordingly at all events he had had it from mrs newsome that she had at whatever cost to her more strenuous view conformed in the matter of preparing chad wholly to his restrictions he now looked up at the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had been bungled the mistake was at least his property
was there perhaps just a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the boulevard and well in the pleasant light
many things came over him here and one of them was that he should doubtless presently know whether he had been shallow or sharp
another was that the balcony in question didn't somehow show as a convenience easy to surrender
poor strether had at this very moment to recognise the truth that wherever one paused in paris the imagination reacted before one could stop it
this perpetual reaction put a price if one would on pauses but it piled up consequences till there was scarce room to pick one's steps among them
what call had he at such a juncture for example to like chad's very house
high broad clearhe was expert enough to make out in a moment that it was admirably builtit fairly embarrassed our friend by the quality that as he would have said it sprang on him
he had struck off the fancy that it might as a preliminary be of service to him to be seen by a happy accident from the thirdstory windows which took all the march sun but of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment that the quality sprung the quality produced by measure and balance the fine relation of part to part and space to space was probablyaided by the presence of ornament as positive as it was discreet and by the complexion of the stone a cold fair grey warmed and polished a little by lifeneither more nor less than a case of distinction such a case as he could only feel unexpectedly as a sort of delivered challenge
meanwhile however the chance he had allowed forthe chance of being seen in time from the balconyhad become a fact
two or three of the windows stood open to the violet air and before strether had cut the knot by crossing a young man had come out and looked about him had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match over and then resting on the rail had given himself up to watching the life below while he smoked
his arrival contributed in its order to keeping strether in position the result of which in turn was that strether soon felt himself noticed
the young man began to look at him as in acknowledgement of his being himself in observation
this was interesting so far as it went but the interest was affected by the young man's not being chad
strether wondered at first if he were perhaps chad altered and then saw that this was asking too much of alteration
the young man was light bright and alertwith an air too pleasant to have been arrived at by patching
strether had conceived chad as patched but not beyond recognition
he was in presence he felt of amendments enough as they stood it was a sufficient amendment that the gentleman up there should be chad's friend
he was young too then the gentleman up therehe was very young young enough apparently to be amused at an elderly watcher to be curious even to see what the elderly watcher would do on finding himself watched
there was youth in that there was youth in the surrender to the balcony there was youth for strether at this moment in everything but his own business and chad's thus pronounced association with youth had given the next instant an extraordinary quick lift to the issue
the balcony the distinguished front testified suddenly for strether's fancy to something that was up and up they placed the whole case materially and as by an admirable image on a level that he found himself at the end of another moment rejoicing to think he might reach
the young man looked at him still he looked at the young man and the issue by a rapid process was that this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to him the last of luxuries
to him too the perched privacy was open and he saw it now but in one lightthat of the only domicile the only fireside in the great ironic city on which he had the shadow of a claim
miss gostrey had a fireside she had told him of it and it was something that doubtless awaited him but miss gostrey hadn't yet arrivedshe mightn't arrive for days and the sole attenuation of his excluded state was his vision of the small the admittedly secondary hotel in the byestreet from the rue de la paix in which her solicitude for his purse had placed him which affected him somehow as all indoor chill glassroofed court and slippery staircase and which by the same token expressed the presence of waymarsh even at times when waymarsh might have been certain to be round at the bank
it came to pass before he moved that waymarsh and waymarsh alone waymarsh not only undiluted but positively strengthened struck him as the present alternative to the young man in the balcony
when he did move it was fairly to escape that alternative
taking his way over the street at last and passing through the portecochere of the house was like consciously leaving waymarsh out
however he would tell him all about it
book third     i   strether told waymarsh all about it that very evening on their dining together at the hotel which needn't have happened he was all the while aware hadn't he chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer opportunity
the mention to his companion of the sacrifice was moreover exactly what introduced his recitalor as he would have called it with more confidence in his interlocutor his confession
his confession was that he had been captured and that one of the features of the affair had just failed to be his engaging himself on the spot to dinner
as by such a freedom waymarsh would have lost him he had obeyed his scruple and he had likewise obeyed another scruplewhich bore on the question of his himself bringing a guest
waymarsh looked gravely ardent over the finished soup at this array of scruples strether hadn't yet got quite used to being so unprepared for the consequences of the impression he produced
it was comparatively easy to explain however that he hadn't felt sure his guest would please
the person was a young man whose acquaintance he had made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry for another personan enquiry his new friend had just prevented in fact from being vain
oh said strether i've all sorts of things to tell you
and he put it in a way that was a virtual hint to waymarsh to help him to enjoy the telling
he waited for his fish he drank of his wine he wiped his long moustache he leaned back in his chair he took in the two english ladies who had just creaked past them and whom he would even have articulately greeted if they hadn't rather chilled the impulse so that all he could do wasby way of doing somethingto say merci francois
out quite loud when his fish was brought
everything was there that he wanted everything that could make the moment an occasion that would do beautifullyeverything but what waymarsh might give
the little waxed salleamanger was sallow and sociable francois dancing over it all smiles was a man and a brother the highshouldered patronne with her highheld muchrubbed hands seemed always assenting exuberantly to something unsaid the paris evening in short was for strether in the very taste of the soup in the goodness as he was innocently pleased to think it of the wine in the pleasant coarse texture of the napkin and the crunch of the thickcrusted bread
these all were things congruous with his confession and his confession was that he hadit would come out properly just there if waymarsh would only take it properlyagreed to breakfast out at twelve literally the next day
he didn't quite know where the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of his new friend's we'll see i'll take you somewhere
for it had required little more than that after all to let him right in
he was affected after a minute face to face with his actual comrade by the impulse to overcolour
there had already been things in respect to which he knew himself tempted by this perversity
if waymarsh thought them bad he should at least have his reason for his discomfort so strether showed them as worse
still he was now in his way sincerely perplexed
chad had been absent from the boulevard malesherbeswas absent from paris altogether he had learned that from the concierge but had nevertheless gone up and gone upthere were no two ways about itfrom an uncontrollable a really if one would depraved curiosity
the concierge had mentioned to him that a friend of the tenant of the troisieme was for the time in possession and this had been strether's pretext for a further enquiry an experiment carried on under chad's roof without his knowledge
i found his friend in fact there keeping the place warm as he called it for him chad himself being as appears in the south
he went a month ago to cannes and though his return begins to be looked for it can't be for some days
i might you see perfectly have waited a week might have beaten a retreat as soon as i got this essential knowledge
but i beat no retreat i did the opposite i stayed i dawdled i trifled above all i looked round
i saw in fine andi don't know what to call iti sniffed
it's a detail but it's as if there were somethingsomething very goodto sniff
waymarsh's face had shown his friend an attention apparently so remote that the latter was slightly surprised to find it at this point abreast with him
do you mean a smell
what of
a charming scent
but i don't know
waymarsh gave an inferential grunt
does he live there with a woman
i don't know
waymarsh waited an instant for more then resumed
has he taken her off with him
and will he bring her back
strether fell into the enquiry
but he wound it up as before
i don't know
the way he wound it up accompanied as this was with another drop back another degustation of the leoville another wipe of his moustache and another good word for francois seemed to produce in his companion a slight irritation
then what the devil do you know
well said strether almost gaily i guess i don't know anything
his gaiety might have been a tribute to the fact that the state he had been reduced to did for him again what had been done by his talk of the matter with miss gostrey at the london theatre
it was somehow enlarging and the air of that amplitude was now doubtless more or lessand all for waymarsh to feelin his further response
that's what i found out from the young man
but i thought you said you found out nothing
nothing but thatthat i don't know anything
and what good does that do you
it's just said strether what i've come to you to help me to discover
i mean anything about anything over here
i felt that up there
it regularly rose before me in its might
the young man moreoverchad's friendas good as told me so
as good as told you you know nothing about anything
waymarsh appeared to look at some one who might have as good as told him
how old is he
well i guess not thirty
yet you had to take that from him
oh i took a good deal moresince as i tell you i took an invitation to dejeuner
and are you going to that unholy meal
if you'll come with me
he wants you too you know
i told him about you
he gave me his card strether pursued and his name's rather funny
it's john little bilham and he says his two surnames are on account of his being small inevitably used together
well waymarsh asked with due detachment from these details what's he doing up there
his account of himself is that he's 'only a little artistman'
that seemed to me perfectly to describe him
but he's yet in the phase of study this you know is the great artschoolto pass a certain number of years in which he came over
and he's a great friend of chad's and occupying chad's rooms just now because they're so pleasant
he's very pleasant and curious too strether addedthough he's not from boston
waymarsh looked already rather sick of him
where is he from
strether thought
i don't know that either
but he's 'notoriously' as he put it himself not from boston
well waymarsh moralised from dry depths every one can't notoriously be from boston
why he continued is he curious
perhaps just for thatfor one thing
but really strether added for everything
when you meet him you'll see
oh i don't want to meet him waymarsh impatiently growled
why don't he go home
strether hesitated
well because he likes it over here
this appeared in particular more than waymarsh could bear
he ought then to be ashamed of himself and as you admit that you think so too why drag him in
strether's reply again took time
perhaps i do think so myselfthough i don't quite yet admit it
i'm not a bit sureit's again one of the things i want to find out
i liked him and can you like people
but no matter
he pulled himself up
there's no doubt i want you to come down on me and squash me
waymarsh helped himself to the next course which however proving not the dish he had just noted as supplied to the english ladies had the effect of causing his imagination temporarily to wander
but it presently broke out at a softer spot
have they got a handsome place up there
oh a charming place full of beautiful and valuable things
i never saw such a placeand strether's thought went back to it
for a little artistman
he could in fact scarce express it
but his companion who appeared now to have a view insisted
well
well life can hold nothing better
besides they're things of which he's in charge
so that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair
can life waymarsh enquired hold nothing better than that
then as strether silent seemed even yet to wonder doesn't he know what she is
he went on
i don't know
i didn't ask him
i couldn't
it was impossible
you wouldn't either
besides i didn't want to
no more would you
strether in short explained it at a stroke
you can't make out over here what people do know
then what did you come over for
well i suppose exactly to see for myselfwithout their aid
then what do you want mine for
oh strether laughed you're not one of them
i do know what you know
as however this last assertion caused waymarsh again to look at him hardsuch being the latter's doubt of its implicationshe felt his justification lame
which was still more the case when waymarsh presently said  look here strether
quit this
our friend smiled with a doubt of his own
do you mean my tone
nodamn your tone
i mean your nosing round
quit the whole job
let them stew in their juice
you're being used for a thing you ain't fit for
people don't take a finetooth comb to groom a horse
am i a finetooth comb
strether laughed
it's something i never called myself
it's what you are all the same
you ain't so young as you were but you've kept your teeth
he acknowledged his friend's humour
take care i don't get them into you
you'd like them my friends at home waymarsh he declared you'd really particularly like them
and i knowit was slightly irrelevant but he gave it sudden and singular forcei know they'd like you
oh don't work them off on me
waymarsh groaned
yet strether still lingered with his hands in his pockets
it's really quite as indispensable as i say that chad should be got back
indispensable to whom
to you
yes strether presently said
because if you get him you also get mrs
newsome
strether faced it
yes
and if you don't get him you don't get her
it might be merciless but he continued not to flinch
i think it might have some effect on our personal understanding
chad's of real importanceor can easily become so if he willto the business
and the business is of real importance to his mother's husband
well i naturally want what my future wife wants
and the thing will be much better if we have our own man in it
if you have your own man in it in other words waymarsh said you'll marryyou personallymore money
she's already rich as i understand you but she'll be richer still if the business can be made to boom on certain lines that you've laid down
i haven't laid them down strether promptly returned
mr newsomewho knew extraordinarily well what he was aboutlaid them down ten years ago
oh well waymarsh seemed to indicate with a shake of his mane that didn't matter
you're fierce for the boom anyway
his friend weighed a moment in silence the justice of the charge
i can scarcely be called fierce i think when i so freely take my chance of the possibility the danger of being influenced in a sense counter to mrs newsome's own feelings
waymarsh gave this proposition a long hard look
i see
you're afraid yourself of being squared
but you're a humbug he added all the same
oh
strether quickly protested
yes you ask me for protectionwhich makes you very interesting and then you won't take it
you say you want to be squashed  ah but not so easily
don't you see strether demanded where my interest as already shown you lies
it lies in my not being squared
if i'm squared where's my marriage
if i miss my errand i miss that and if i miss that i miss everythingi'm nowhere
waymarshbut all relentlesslytook this in
what do i care where you are if you're spoiled
their eyes met on it an instant
thank you awfully strether at last said
but don't you think her judgement of that
ought to content me
no
it kept them again face to face and the end of this was that strether again laughed
you do her injustice
you really must know her
goodnight
he breakfasted with mr bilham on the morrow and as inconsequently befell with waymarsh massively of the party
the latter announced at the eleventh hour and much to his friend's surprise that damn it he would as soon join him as do anything else on which they proceeded together strolling in a state of detachment practically luxurious for them to the boulevard malesherbes a couple engaged that day with the sharp spell of paris as confessedly it might have been seen as any couple among the daily thousands so compromised
they walked wandered wondered and a little lost themselves strether hadn't had for years so rich a consciousness of timea bag of gold into which he constantly dipped for a handful
it was present to him that when the little business with mr bilham should be over he would still have shining hours to use absolutely as he liked
there was no great pulse of haste yet in this process of saving chad nor was that effect a bit more marked as he sat half an hour later with his legs under chad's mahogany with mr bilham on one side with a friend of mr bilham's on the other with waymarsh stupendously opposite and with the great hum of paris coming up in softness vaguenessfor strether himself indeed already positive sweetnessthrough the sunny windows toward which the day before his curiosity had raised its wings from below
the feeling strongest with him at that moment had borne fruit almost faster than he could taste it and strether literally felt at the present hour that there was a precipitation in his fate
he had known nothing and nobody as he stood in the street but hadn't his view now taken a bound in the direction of every one and of every thing
what's he up to what's he up to
something like that was at the back of his head all the while in respect to little bilham but meanwhile till he should make out every one and every thing were as good as represented for him by the combination of his host and the lady on his left
the lady on his left the lady thus promptly and ingeniously invited to meet mr strether and mr waymarshit was the way she herself expressed her casewas a very marked person a person who had much to do with our friend's asking himself if the occasion weren't in its essence the most baited the most gilded of traps
baited it could properly be called when the repast was of so wise a savour and gilded surrounding objects seemed inevitably to need to be when miss barracewhich was the lady's namelooked at them with convex parisian eyes and through a glass with a remarkably long tortoiseshell handle
why miss barrace mature meagre erect and eminently gay highly adorned perfectly familiar freely contradictions and reminding him of some lastcentury portrait of a clever head without powderwhy miss barrace should have been in particular the note of a trap strether couldn't on the spot have explained he blinked in the light of a conviction that he should know later on and know wellas it came over him for that matter with force that he should need to
he wondered what he was to think exactly of either of his new friends since the young man chad's intimate and deputy had in thus constituting the scene practised so much more subtly than he had been prepared for and since in especial miss barrace surrounded clearly by every consideration hadn't scrupled to figure as a familiar object
it was interesting to him to feel that he was in the presence of new measures other standards a different scale of relations and that evidently here were a happy pair who didn't think of things at all as he and waymarsh thought
nothing was less to have been calculated in the business than that it should now be for him as if he and waymarsh were comparatively quite at one
the latter was magnificentthis at least was an assurance privately given him by miss barrace
oh your friend's a type the grand old americanwhat shall one call it
the hebrew prophet ezekiel jeremiah who used when i was a little girl in the rue montaigne to come to see my father and who was usually the american minister to the tuileries or some other court
i haven't seen one these ever so many years the sight of it warms my poor old chilled heart this specimen is wonderful in the right quarter you know he'll have a succes fou
strether hadn't failed to ask what the right quarter might be much as he required his presence of mind to meet such a change in their scheme
oh the artistquarter and that kind of thing here already for instance as you see
he had been on the point of echoing 'here'is this the artistquarter
but she had already disposed of the question with a wave of all her tortoiseshell and an easy bring him to me
he knew on the spot how little he should be able to bring him for the very air was by this time to his sense thick and hot with poor waymarsh's judgement of it
he was in the trap still more than his companion and unlike his companion not making the best of it which was precisely what doubtless gave him his admirable sombre glow
little did miss barrace know that what was behind it was his grave estimate of her own laxity
the general assumption with which our two friends had arrived had been that of finding mr bilham ready to conduct them to one or other of those resorts of the earnest the aesthetic fraternity which were shown among the sights of paris
in this character it would have justified them in a proper insistence on discharging their score
waymarsh's only proviso at the last had been that nobody should pay for him but he found himself as the occasion developed paid for on a scale as to which strether privately made out that he already nursed retribution
strether was conscious across the table of what worked in him conscious when they passed back to the small salon to which the previous evening he himself had made so rich a reference conscious most of all as they stepped out to the balcony in which one would have had to be an ogre not to recognise the perfect place for easy aftertastes
these things were enhanced for miss barrace by a succession of excellent cigarettesacknowledged acclaimed as a part of the wonderful supply left behind him by chadin an almost equal absorption of which strether found himself blindly almost wildly pushing forward
he might perish by the sword as well as by famine and he knew that his having abetted the lady by an excess that was rare with him would count for little in the sumas waymarsh might so easily add it upof her licence
waymarsh had smoked of old smoked hugely but waymarsh did nothing now and that gave him his advantage over people who took things up lightly just when others had laid them heavily down
strether had never smoked and he felt as if he flaunted at his friend that this had been only because of a reason
the reason it now began to appear even to himself was that he had never had a lady to smoke with
it was this lady's being there at all however that was the strange free thing perhaps since she was there her smoking was the least of her freedoms
if strether had been sure at each juncture of whatwith bilham in especialshe talked about he might have traced others and winced at them and felt waymarsh wince but he was in fact so often at sea that his sense of the range of reference was merely general and that he on several different occasions guessed and interpreted only to doubt
he wondered what they meant but there were things he scarce thought they could be supposed to mean and oh nonot that
was at the end of most of his ventures
this was the very beginning with him of a condition as to which later on it will be seen he found cause to pull himself up and he was to remember the moment duly as the first step in a process
the central fact of the place was neither more nor less when analysedand a pressure superficial sufficedthan the fundamental impropriety of chad's situation round about which they thus seemed cynically clustered
accordingly since they took it for granted they took for granted all that was in connexion with it taken for granted at woollettmatters as to which verily he had been reduced with mrs newsome to the last intensity of silence
that was the consequence of their being too bad to be talked about and was the accompaniment by the same token of a deep conception of their badness
it befell therefore that when poor strether put it to himself that their badness was ultimately or perhaps even insolently what such a scene as the one before him was so to speak built upon he could scarce shirk the dilemma of reading a roundabout echo of them into almost anything that came up
this he was well aware was a dreadful necessity but such was the stern logic he could only gather of a relation to the irregular life
it was the way the irregular life sat upon bilham and miss barrace that was the insidious the delicate marvel
he was eager to concede that their relation to it was all indirect for anything else in him would have shown the grossness of bad manners but the indirectness was none the less consonantthat was strikingwith a grateful enjoyment of everything that was chad's
they spoke of him repeatedly invoking his good name and good nature and the worst confusion of mind for strether was that all their mention of him was of a kind to do him honour
they commended his munificence and approved his taste and in doing so sat down as it seemed to strether in the very soil out of which these things flowered
our friend's final predicament was that he himself was sitting down for the time with them and there was a supreme moment at which compared with his collapse waymarsh's erectness affected him as really high
one thing was certainhe saw he must make up his mind
he must approach chad must wait for him deal with him master him but he mustn't dispossess himself of the faculty of seeing things as they were
he must bring him to himnot go himself as it were so much of the way
he must at any rate be clearer as to whatshould he continue to do that for conveniencehe was still condoning
it was on the detail of this quantityand what could the fact be but mystifyingthat bilham and miss barrace threw so little light
so there they were
ii   when miss gostrey arrived at the end of a week she made him a sign he went immediately to see her and it wasn't till then that he could again close his grasp on the idea of a corrective
this idea however was luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the threshold of the little entresol of the quartier marboeuf into which she had gathered as she said picking them up in a thousand flights and funny little passionate pounces the makings of a final nest
he recognised in an instant that there really there only he should find the boon with the vision of which he had first mounted chad's stairs
he might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more in this place he should know himself in hadn't his friend been on the spot to measure the amount to his appetite
her compact and crowded little chambers almost dusky as they at first struck him with accumulations represented a supreme general adjustment to opportunities and conditions
wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or an old brocade and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a misappliance
the life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more charged with possession even than chad's or than miss barrace's wide as his glimpse had lately become of the empire of things what was before him still enlarged it the lust of the eyes and the pride of life had indeed thus their temple
it was the innermost nook of the shrineas brown as a pirate's cave
in the brownness were glints of gold patches of purple were in the gloom objects all that caught through the muslin with their high rarity the light of the low windows
nothing was clear about them but that they were precious and they brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower in a liberty taken with him might have been whisked under his nose
but after a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most concerned him
the circle in which they stood together was warm with life and every question between them would live there as nowhere else
a question came up as soon as they had spoken for his answer with a laugh was quickly  well they've got hold of me
much of their talk on this first occasion was his development of that truth
he was extraordinarily glad to see her expressing to her frankly what she most showed him that one might live for years without a blessing unsuspected but that to know it at last for no more than three days was to need it or miss it for ever
she was the blessing that had now become his need and what could prove it better than that without her he had lost himself
what do you mean
she asked with an absence of alarm that correcting him as if he had mistaken the period of one of her pieces gave him afresh a sense of her easy movement through the maze he had but begun to tread
what in the name of all the pococks have you managed to do
why exactly the wrong thing
i've made a frantic friend of little bilham
ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been allowed for from the first
and it was only after this that quite as a minor matter she asked who in the world little bilham might be
when she learned that he was a friend of chad's and living for the time in chad's rooms in chad's absence quite as if acting in chad's spirit and serving chad's cause she showed however more interest
should you mind my seeing him
only once you know she added
oh the oftener the better  he's amusinghe's original
he doesn't shock you
miss gostrey threw out
never in the world
we escape that with a perfection
i feel it to be largely no doubt because i don't halfunderstand him but our modus vivendi isn't spoiled even by that
you must dine with me to meet him strether went on
then you'll see'
are you giving dinners
yesthere i am
that's what i mean
all her kindness wondered
that you're spending too much money
dear nothey seem to cost so little
but that i do it to them
i ought to hold off
she thought againshe laughed
the money you must be spending to think it cheap
but i must be out of itto the naked eye
he looked for a moment as if she were really failing him
then you won't meet them
it was almost as if she had developed an unexpected personal prudence
she hesitated
who are theyfirst
why little bilham to begin with
he kept back for the moment miss barrace
and chadwhen he comesyou must absolutely see
when then does he come
when bilham has had time to write him and hear from him about me
bilham however he pursued will report favourablyfavourably for chad
that will make him not afraid to come
i want you the more therefore you see for my bluff
oh you'll do yourself for your bluff
she was perfectly easy
at the rate you've gone i'm quiet
ah but i haven't said strether made one protest
she turned it over
haven't you been seeing what there's to protest about
he let her with this however ruefully have the whole truth
i haven't yet found a single thing
isn't there any one with him then
of the sort i came out about
strether took a moment
how do i know
and what do i care
oh oh
and her laughter spread
he was struck in fact by the effect on her of his joke
he saw now how he meant it as a joke
she saw however still other things though in an instant she had hidden them
you've got at no facts at all
he tried to muster them
well he has a lovely home
ah that in paris she quickly returned proves nothing
that is rather it disproves nothing
they may very well you see the people your mission is concerned with have done it for him
exactly
and it was on the scene of their doings then that waymarsh and i sat guzzling
oh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings she replied you might easily die of starvation
with which she smiled at him
you've worse before you
ah i've everything before me
but on our hypothesis you know they must be wonderful
they are
said miss gostrey
you're not therefore you see she added wholly without facts
they've been in effect wonderful
to have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a little to helpa wave by which moreover the next moment recollection was washed
my young man does admit furthermore that they're our friend's great interest
is that the expression he uses
strether more exactly recalled
nonot quite
something more vivid
less
he had bent with neared glasses over a group of articles on a small stand and at this he came up
it was a mere allusion but on the lookout as i was it struck me
'awful you know as chad is'those were bilham's words
'awful you know'
oh
and miss gostrey turned them over
she seemed however satisfied
well what more do you want
he glanced once more at a bibelot or two and everything sent him back
but it is all the same as if they wished to let me have it between the eyes
she wondered
quoi donc
why what i speak of
the amenity
they can stun you with that as well as with anything else
oh she answered you'll come round
i must see them each she went on for myself
i mean mr bilham and mr newsomemr bilham naturally first
once onlyonce for each that will do
but face to facefor half an hour
what's mr chad she immediately pursued doing at cannes
decent men don't go to cannes with thewell with the kind of ladies you mean
don't they
strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused her
no elsewhere but not to cannes
cannes is different
cannes is better
cannes is best
i mean it's all people you knowwhen you do know them
and if he does why that's different too
he must have gone alone
she can't be with him
i haven't strether confessed in his weakness the least idea
there seemed much in what she said but he was able after a little to help her to a nearer impression
the meeting with little bilham took place by easy arrangement in the great gallery of the louvre and when standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid titiansthe overwhelming portrait of the young man with the strangelyshaped glove and the bluegrey eyeshe turned to see the third member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and gilded vista he had a sense of having at last taken hold
he had agreed with miss gostreyit dated even from chesterfor a morning at the louvre and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown out by little bilham whom he had already accompanied to the museum of the luxembourg
the fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty and it was to strike him again that in little bilham's company contrarieties in general dropped
oh he's all righthe's one of us
miss gostrey after the first exchange soon found a chance to murmur to her companion and strether as they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the two appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarksstrether knew that he knew almost immediately what she meant and took it as still another sign that he had got his job in hand
this was the more grateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him as an acquisition positively new
he wouldn't have known even the day before what she meantthat is if she meant what he assumed that they were intense americans together
he had just worked roundand with a sharper turn of the screw than any yetto the conception of an american intense as little bilham was intense
the young man was his first specimen the specimen had profoundly perplexed him at present however there was light
it was by little bilham's amazing serenity that he had at first been affected but he had inevitably in his circumspection felt it as the trail of the serpent the corruption as he might conveniently have said of europe whereas the promptness with which it came up for miss gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well
he wanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience and this fully permitted it
what had muddled him was precisely the small artistman's wayit was so completeof being more american than anybody
but it now for the time put strether vastly at his ease to have this view of a new way
the amiable youth then looked out as it had first struck strether at a world in respect to which he hadn't a prejudice
the one our friend most instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation accepted
little bilham had an occupation but it was only an occupation declined and it was by his general exemption from alarm anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity was made
he had come out to paris to paintto fathom that is at large that mystery but study had been fatal to him so far as anything could be fatal and his productive power faltered in proportion as his knowledge grew
strether had gathered from him that at the moment of his finding him in chad's rooms he hadn't saved from his shipwreck a scrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed habit of paris
he referred to these things with an equal fond familiarity and it was sufficiently clear that as an outfit they still served him
they were charming to strether through the hour spent at the louvre where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part of the charged iridescent air the glamour of the name the splendour of the space the colour of the masters
yet they were present too wherever the young man led and the day after the visit to the louvre they hung in a different walk about the steps of our party
he had invited his companions to cross the river with him offering to show them his own poor place and his own poor place which was very poor gave to his idiosyncrasies for stretherthe small sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as freshan odd and engaging dignity
he lived at the end of an alley that went out of an old short cobbled street a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenuestreet and avenue and alley having however in common a sort of social shabbiness and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence
the comrade was another ingenuous compatriot to whom he had wired that tea was to await them regardless and this reckless repast and the second ingenuous compatriot and the faraway makeshift life with its jokes and its gaps its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all elsethese things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered
he liked the ingenuous compatriotsfor two or three others soon gathered he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminationsinvolving references indeed involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him as they said sit up he liked above all the legend of goodhumoured poverty of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic that he soon read into the scene
the ingenuous compatriots showed a candour he thought surpassing even the candour of woollett they were redhaired and longlegged they were quaint and queer and dear and droll they made the place resound with the vernacular which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the chosen language he must suppose of contemporary art
they twanged with a vengeance the aesthetic lyrethey drew from it wonderful airs
this aspect of their life had an admirable innocence and he looked on occasion at maria gostrey to see to what extent that element reached her
she gave him however for the hour as she had given him the previous day no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys meeting them with the air of old parisian practice that she had for every one for everything in turn
wonderful about the delicate daubs masterful about the way to make tea trustful about the legs of chairs and familiarly reminiscent of those in the other time the named the numbered or the caricatured who had flourished or failed disappeared or arrived she had accepted with the best grace her second course of little bilham and had said to strether the previous afternoon on his leaving them that since her impression was to be renewed she would reserve judgement till after the new evidence
the new evidence was to come as it proved in a day or two
he soon had from maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the francais had been lent her for the following night it seeming on such occasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such approaches
the sense of how she was always paying for something in advance was equalled on strether's part only by the sense of how she was always being paid all of which made for his consciousness in the larger air of a lively bustling traffic the exchange of such values as were not for him to handle
she hated he knew at the french play anything but a boxjust as she hated at the english anything but a stall and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself to press upon her
but she had for that matter her community with little bilham  she too always on the great issues showed as having known in time
it made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him mainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement their account would stand
he endeavoured even now to keep it a little straight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should dine with him first but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight o'clock on the morrow he awaited her with waymarsh under the pillared portico
she hadn't dined with him and it was characteristic of their relation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least understanding it
she ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as her tenderest touches
it was on that principle for instance that giving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little bilham she had suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box
strether had dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the boulevard malesherbes but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he had received no response to his message
he held however even after they had been for some time conveniently seated that their friend who knew his way about would come in at his own right moment
his temporary absence moreover seemed as never yet to make the right moment for miss gostrey
strether had been waiting till tonight to get back from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions
she had elected as they said to see little bilham once but now she had seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word
waymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between and miss gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her little charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature
the glory was happily unobjectionable and the little charges were candid for herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their innocence
but she referred in due time to their absent friend whom it was clear they should have to give up
he either won't have got your note she said or you won't have got his  he has had some kind of hindrance and of course for that matter you know a man never writes about coming to a box
she spoke as if with her look it might have been waymarsh who had written to the youth and the latter's face showed a mixture of austerity and anguish
she went on however as if to meet this
he's far and away you know the best of them
the best of whom ma'am
why of all the long processionthe boys the girls or the old men and old women as they sometimes really are the hope as one may say of our country
they've all passed year after year but there has been no one in particular i've ever wanted to stop
i feeldon't youthat i want to stop little bilham he's so exactly right as he is
she continued to talk to waymarsh
he's too delightful
if he'll only not spoil it
but they always will they always do they always have
i don't think waymarsh knows strether said after a moment quite what it's open to bilham to spoil
it can't be a good american waymarsh lucidly enough replied for it didn't strike me the young man had developed much in that shape
ah miss gostrey sighed the name of the good american is as easily given as taken away
what is it to begin with to be one and what's the extraordinary hurry
surely nothing that's so pressing was ever so little defined
it's such an order really that before we cook you the dish we must at least have your receipt
besides the poor chicks have time
what i've seen so often spoiled she pursued is the happy attitude itself the state of faith andwhat shall i call itthe sense of beauty
you're right about himshe now took in strether little bilham has them to a charm we must keep little bilham along
then she was all again for waymarsh
the others have all wanted so dreadfully to do something and they've gone and done it in too many cases indeed
it leaves them never the same afterwards the charm's always somehow broken
now he i think you know really won't
he won't do the least dreadful little thing
we shall continue to enjoy him just as he is
nohe's quite beautiful
he sees everything
he isn't a bit ashamed
he has every scrap of the courage of it that one could ask
only think what he might do
one wants reallyfor fear of some accidentto keep him in view
at this very moment perhaps what mayn't he be up to
i've had my disappointmentsthe poor things are never really safe or only at least when you have them under your eye
one can never completely trust them
one's uneasy and i think that's why i most miss him now
she had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her ideaan enjoyment that her face communicated to strether who almost wished none the less at this moment that she would let poor waymarsh alone
he knew more or less what she meant but the fact wasn't a reason for her not pretending to waymarsh that he didn't
it was craven of him perhaps but he would for the high amenity of the occasion have liked waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit
her recognition of it gave him away and before she had done with him or with that article would give him worse
what was he all the same to do
he looked across the box at his friend their eyes met something queer and stiff something that bore on the situation but that it was better not to touch passed in silence between them
well the effect of it for strether was an abrupt reaction a final impatience of his own tendency to temporise
where was that taking him anyway
it was one of the quiet instants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to the historic muse
the only qualification of the quietness was the synthetic oh hang it
into which strether's share of the silence soundlessly flowered
it represented this mute ejaculation a final impulse to burn his ships
these ships to the historic muse may seem of course mere cockles but when he presently spoke to miss gostrey it was with the sense at least of applying the torch
is it then a conspiracy
between the two young men
well i don't pretend to be a seer or a prophetess she presently replied but if i'm simply a woman of sense he's working for you tonight
i don't quite know howbut it's in my bones
and she looked at him at last as if little material as she yet gave him he'd really understand
for an opinion that's my opinion
he makes you out too well not to
not to work for me tonight
strether wondered
then i hope he isn't doing anything very bad
they've got you she portentously answered
do you mean he is
they've got you she merely repeated
though she disclaimed the prophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had ever met to the priestess of the oracle
the light was in her eyes
you must face it now
he faced it on the spot
they had arranged
every move in the game
and they've been arranging ever since
he has had every day his little telegram from cannes
it made strether open his eyes
do you know that
i do better
i see it
this was before i met him what i wondered whether i was to see
but as soon as i met him i ceased to wonder and our second meeting made me sure
i took him all in
he was actinghe is stillon his daily instructions
so that chad has done the whole thing
oh nonot the whole
we've done some of it
you and i and 'europe'
europeyes strether mused
dear old paris she seemed to explain
but there was more and with one of her turns she risked it
and dear old waymarsh
you she declared have been a good bit of it
he sat massive
a good bit of what ma'am
why of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here
you've helped too in your way to float him to where he is
and where the devil is he
she passed it on with a laugh
where the devil strether are you
he spoke as if he had just been thinking it out
well quite already in chad's hands it would seem
and he had had with this another thought
will that bejust all through bilhamthe way he's going to work it
it would be for him you know an idea
and chad with an idea
well
she asked while the image held him
well is chadwhat shall i saymonstrous
oh as much as you like
but the idea you speak of she said won't have been his best
he'll have a better
it won't be all through little bilham that he'll work it
this already sounded almost like a hope destroyed
through whom else then
that's what we shall see
but quite as she spoke she turned and strether turned for the door of the box had opened with the click of the ouvreuse  from the lobby and a gentleman a stranger to them had come in with a quick step
the door closed behind him and though their faces showed him his mistake his air which was striking was all good confidence
the curtain had just again arisen and in the hush of the general attention strether's challenge was tacit as was also the greeting with a quickly deprecating hand and smile of the unannounced visitor
he discreetly signed that he would wait would stand and these things and his face one look from which she had caught had suddenly worked for miss gostrey
she fitted to them all an answer for strether's last question
the solid stranger was simply the answeras she now turning to her friend indicated
she brought it straight out for himit presented the intruder
why through this gentleman
the gentleman indeed at the same time though sounding for strether a very short name did practically as much to explain
strether gasped the name backthen only had he seen miss gostrey had said more than she knew
they were in presence of chad himself
our friend was to go over it afterwards again and againhe was going over it much of the time that they were together and they were together constantly for three or four days  the note had been so strongly struck during that first halfhour that everything happening since was comparatively a minor development
the fact was that his perception of the young man's identityso absolutely checked for a minutehad been quite one of the sensations that count in life he certainly had never known one that had acted as he might have said with more of a crowded rush
and the rush though both vague and multitudinous had lasted a long time protected as it were yet at the same time aggravated by the circumstance of its coinciding with a stretch of decorous silence
they couldn't talk without disturbing the spectators in the part of the balcony just below them and it for that matter came to stretherbeing a thing of the sort that did come to himthat these were the accidents of a high civilisation the imposed tribute to propriety the frequent exposure to conditions usually brilliant in which relief has to await its time
relief was never quite near at hand for kings queens comedians and other such people and though you might be yourself not exactly one of those you could yet in leading the life of high pressure guess a little how they sometimes felt
it was truly the life of high pressure that strether had seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there close to chad during the long tension of the act
he was in presence of a fact that occupied his whole mind that occupied for the halfhour his senses themselves all together but he couldn't without inconvenience show anythingwhich moreover might count really as luck
what he might have shown had he shown at all was exactly the kind of emotionthe emotion of bewildermentthat he had proposed to himself from the first whatever should occur to show least
the phenomenon that had suddenly sat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his imagination which had worked so beforehand felt itself in the connexion without margin or allowance
it had faced every contingency but that chad should not be chad and this was what it now had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush
he asked himself if by any chance before he should have in some way to commit himself he might feel his mind settled to the new vision might habituate it so to speak to the remarkable truth
but oh it was too remarkable the truth for what could be more remarkable than this sharp rupture of an identity
you could deal with a man as himselfyou couldn't deal with him as somebody else
it was a small source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an event what a sum he was setting you
he couldn't absolutely not know for you couldn't absolutely not let him
it was a case then simply a strong case as people nowadays called such things' a case of transformation unsurpassed and the hope was but in the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without
perhaps he strether himself was the only person after all aware of it
even miss gostrey with all her science wouldn't be would sheand he had never seen any one less aware of anything than waymarsh as he glowered at chad
the social sightlessness of his old friend's survey marked for him afresh and almost in an humiliating way the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source
he was not certain however of not drawing a shade of compensation from the privilege as yet untasted of knowing more about something in particular than miss gostrey did
his situation too was a case for that matter and he was now so interested quite so privately agog about it that he had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards
he derived during his halfhour no assistance from her and just this fact of her not meeting his eyes played a little it must be confessed into his predicament
he had introduced chad in the first minutes under his breath and there was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted but she had none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage where she occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she invited waymarsh to share
the latter's faculty of participation had never had all round such an assault to meet the pressure on him being the sharper for this chosen attitude in her as strether judged it of isolating for their natural intercourse chad and himself
this intercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the young man something markedly like a smile but falling far short of a grin and to the vivacity of strether's private speculation as to whether he carried himself like a fool
he didn't quite see how he could so feel as one without somehow showing as one
the worst of that question moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which annoyed him
if i'm going to be odiously conscious of how i may strike the fellow he reflected it was so little what i came out for that i may as well stop before i begin
this sage consideration too distinctly seemed to leave untouched the fact that he was going to be conscious
he was conscious of everything but of what would have served him
he was to know afterwards in the watches of the night that nothing would have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose to chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby
he hadn't only not proposed it but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as possible
he had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a minute of the show though for that portion of the show then presented he hadn't had an instant's real attention
he couldn't when the curtain fell have given the slightest account of what had happened
he had therefore further not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added by this acceptance of his awkwardness to chad's general patience
hadn't he none the less known at the very timeknown it stupidly and without reactionthat the boy was accepting something
he was modestly benevolent the boythat was at least what he had been capable of the superiority of making out his chance to be and one had one's self literally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him
if we should go into all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should have to mend our pen but an instance or two may mark for us the vividness with which he could remember
he remembered the two absurdities that if his presence of mind had failed were the things that had had most to do with it
he had never in his life seen a young man come into a box at ten o'clock at night and would if challenged on the question in advance have scarce been ready to pronounce as to different ways of doing so
but it was in spite of this definite to him that chad had had a way that was wonderful  a fact carrying with it an implication that as one might imagine it he knew he had learned how
here already then were abounding results he had on the spot and without the least trouble of intention taught strether that even in so small a thing as that there were different ways
he had done in the same line still more than this had by a mere shake or two of the head made his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more than anything else for the eye a matter of the marked streaks of grey extraordinary at his age in his thick black hair as well as that this new feature was curiously becoming to him did something for him as characterisation also evenof all things in the worldas refinement that had been a good deal wanted
strether felt however he would have had to confess that it wouldn't have been easy just now on this and other counts in the presence of what had been supplied to be quite clear as to what had been missed
a reflexion a candid critic might have made of old for instance was that it would have been happier for the son to look more like the mother but this was a reflexion that at present would never occur
the ground had quite fallen away from it yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had supervened
it would have been hard for a young man's face and air to disconnect themselves more completely than chad's at this juncture from any discerned from any imaginable aspect of a new england female parent
that of course was no more than had been on the cards but it produced in strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of mental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset
again and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence of communicating quickly with woollettcommunicating with a quickness with which telegraphy alone would rhyme the fruit really of a fine fancy in him for keeping things straight for the happy forestalment of error
no one could explain better when needful nor put more conscience into an account or a report which burden of conscience is perhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of explanation gathered
his highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of life clear of them
whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid he held that nothing ever was in factfor any one elseexplained
one went through the vain motions but it was mostly a waste of life
a personal relation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly understood or better still didn't care if they didn't
from the moment they cared if they didn't it was living by the sweat of one's brow and the sweat of one's brow was just what one might buy one's self off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion
it easily grew too fast and the atlantic cable now alone could race with it
that agency would each day have testified for him to something that was not what woollett had argued
he was not at this moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrow'sor rather of the night'sappreciation of the crisis wouldn't be to determine some brief missive
have at last seen him but oh dear
some temporary relief of that sort seemed to hover before him
it hovered somehow as preparing them allyet preparing them for what
if he might do so more luminously and cheaply he would tick out in four words  awfully oldgrey hair
to this particular item in chad's appearance he constantly during their mute halfhour reverted as if so very much more than he could have said had been involved in it
the most he could have said would have been  if he's going to make me feel young
which indeed however carried with it quite enough
if strether was to feel young that is it would be because chad was to feel old and an aged and hoary sinner had been no part of the scheme
the question of chadwick's true time of life was doubtless what came up quickest after the adjournment of the two when the play was over to a cafe in the avenue de l'opera
miss gostrey had in due course been perfect for such a step she had known exactly what they wantedto go straight somewhere and talk and strether had even felt she had known what he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin
she hadn't pretended this as she had pretended on the other hand to have divined waymarsh's wish to extend to her an independent protection homeward but strether nevertheless found how after he had chad opposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his companion straightway selected sharply and easily discriminated from others it was quite to his mind as if she heard him speak as if sitting up a mile away in the little apartment he knew she would listen hard enough to catch
he found too that he liked that idea and he wished that by the same token mrs newsome might have caught as well
for what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour nor a fraction of one was to advance to overwhelm with a rush
this was how he would anticipateby a nightattack as might beany forced maturity that a crammed consciousness of paris was likely to take upon itself to assert on behalf of the boy
he knew to the full on what he had just extracted from miss gostrey chad's marks of alertness but they were a reason the more for not dawdling
if he was himself moreover to be treated as young he wouldn't at all events be so treated before he should have struck out at least once
his arms might be pinioned afterwards but it would have been left on record that he was fifty
the importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the theatre it had become a wild unrest urging him to seize his chance
he could scarcely wait for it as they went he was on the verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street he fairly caught himself going onso he afterwards invidiously named itas if there would be for him no second chance should the present be lost
not till on the purple divan before the perfunctory bock he had brought out the words themselves was he sure for that matter that the present would be saved
book fourth     i   i've come you know to make you break with everything neither more nor less and take you straight home so you'll be so good as immediately and favourably to consider it
strether face to face with chad after the play had sounded these words almost breathlessly and with an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone
for chad's receptive attitude was that of a person who had been gracefully quiet while the messenger at last reaching him has run a mile through the dust
during some seconds after he had spoken strether felt as if he had made some such exertion he was not even certain that the perspiration wasn't on his brow
it was the kind of consciousness for which he had to thank the look that while the strain lasted the young man's eyes gave him
they reflectedand the deuce of the thing was that they reflected really with a sort of shyness of kindnesshis momentarily disordered state which fact brought on in its turn for our friend the dawn of a fear that chad might simply take it outtake everything outin being sorry for him
such a fear any fear was unpleasant
but everything was unpleasant it was odd how everything had suddenly turned so
this however was no reason for letting the least thing go
strether had the next minute proceeded as roundly as if with an advantage to follow up
of course i'm a busybody if you want to fight the case to the death but after all mainly in the sense of having known you and having given you such attention as you kindly permitted when you were in jackets and knickerbockers
yesit was knickerbockers i'm busybody enough to remember that and that you had for your agei speak of the first faraway timetremendously stout legs
well we want you to break
your mother's heart's passionately set upon it but she has above and beyond that excellent arguments and reasons
i've not put them into her headi needn't remind you how little she's a person who needs that
but they existyou must take it from me as a friend both of hers and yoursfor myself as well
i didn't invent them i didn't originally work them out but i understand them i think i can explain themby which i mean make you actively do them justice and that's why you see me here
you had better know the worst at once
it's a question of an immediate rupture and an immediate return
i've been conceited enough to dream i can sugar that pill
i take at any rate the greatest interest in the question
i took it already before i left home and i don't mind telling you that altered as you are i take it still more now that i've seen you
you're older andi don't know what to call itmore of a handful but you're by so much the more i seem to make out to our purpose
do i strike you as improved
strether was to recall that chad had at this point enquired
he was likewise to recalland it had to count for some time as his greatest comfortthat it had been given him as they said at woollett to reply with some presence of mind  i haven't the least idea
he was really for a while to like thinking he had been positively hard
on the point of conceding that chad had improved in appearance but that to the question of appearance the remark must be confined he checked even that compromise and left his reservation bare
not only his moral but also as it were his aesthetic sense had a little to pay for this chad being unmistakeablyand wasn't it a matter of the confounded grey hair againhandsomer than he had ever promised
that however fell in perfectly with what strether had said
they had no desire to keep down his proper expansion and he wouldn't be less to their purpose for not looking as he had too often done of old only bold and wild
there was indeed a signal particular in which he would distinctly be more so
strether didn't as he talked absolutely follow himself he only knew he was clutching his thread and that he held it from moment to moment a little tighter his mere uninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that
he had frequently for a month turned over what he should say on this very occasion and he seemed at last to have said nothing he had thought ofeverything was so totally different
but in spite of all he had put the flag at the window
this was what he had done and there was a minute during which he affected himself as having shaken it hard flapped it with a mighty flutter straight in front of his companion's nose
it gave him really almost the sense of having already acted his part
the momentary reliefas if from the knowledge that nothing of that at least could be undonesprang from a particular cause the cause that had flashed into operation in miss gostrey's box with direct apprehension with amazed recognition and that had been concerned since then in every throb of his consciousness
what it came to was that with an absolutely new quantity to deal with one simply couldn't know
the new quantity was represented by the fact that chad had been made over
that was all whatever it was it was everything
strether had never seen the thing so done beforeit was perhaps a speciality of paris
if one had been present at the process one might little by little have mastered the result but he was face to face as matters stood with the finished business
it had freely been noted for him that he might be received as a dog among skittles but that was on the basis of the old quantity
he had originally thought of lines and tones as things to be taken but these possibilities had now quite melted away
there was no computing at all what the young man before him would think or feel or say on any subject whatever
this intelligence strether had afterwards to account for his nervousness reconstituted as he might just as he had also reconstituted the promptness with which chad had corrected his uncertainty
an extraordinarily short time had been required for the correction and there had ceased to be anything negative in his companion's face and air as soon as it was made
your engagement to my mother has become then what they call here a fait accompli
it had consisted the determinant touch in nothing more than that
well that was enough strether had felt while his answer hung fire
he had felt at the same time however that nothing could less become him than that it should hang fire too long
yes he said brightly it was on the happy settlement of the question that i started
you see therefore to what tune i'm in your family
moreover he added i've been supposing you'd suppose it
oh i've been supposing it for a long time and what you tell me helps me to understand that you should want to do something
to do something i mean said chad to commemorate an event sowhat do they call itso auspicious
i see you make out and not unnaturally he continued that bringing me home in triumph as a sort of weddingpresent to mother would commemorate it better than anything else
you want to make a bonfire in fact he laughed and you pitch me on
thank you thank you
he laughed again
he was altogether easy about it and this made strether now see how at bottom and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him nothing he had from the first moment been easy about everything
the shade of shyness was mere good taste
people with manners formed could apparently have as one of their best cards the shade of shyness too
he had leaned a little forward to speak his elbows were on the table and the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was brought by the movement nearer to his critics there was a fascination for that critic in its not being this ripe physiognomy the face that under observation at least he had originally carried away from woollett
strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining it as that of a man of the worlda formula that indeed seemed to come now in some degree to his relief that of a man to whom things had happened and were variously known
in gleams in glances the past did perhaps peep out of it but such lights were faint and instantly merged
chad was brown and thick and strong and of old chad had been rough
was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth
possibly for that he was smooth was as marked as in the taste of a sauce or in the rub of a hand
the effect of it was generalit had retouched his features drawn them with a cleaner line
it had cleared his eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeththe main ornament of his face and at the same time that it had given him a form and a surface almost a design it had toned his voice established his accent encouraged his smile to more play and his other motions to less
he had formerly with a great deal of action expressed very little and he now expressed whatever was necessary with almost none at all
it was as if in short he had really copious perhaps but shapeless been put into a firm mould and turned successfully out
the phenomenonstrether kept eyeing it as a phenomenon an eminent casewas marked enough to be touched by the finger
he finally put his hand across the table and laid it on chad's arm
if you'll promise mehere on the spot and giving me your word of honourto break straight off you'll make the future the real right thing for all of us alike
you'll ease off the strain of this decent but none the less acute suspense in which i've for so many days been waiting for you and let me turn in to rest
i shall leave you with my blessing and go to bed in peace
chad again fell back at this and his hands pocketed settled himself a little in which posture he looked though he rather anxiously smiled only the more earnest
then strether seemed to see that he was really nervous and he took that as what he would have called a wholesome sign
the only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking off and putting on his widebrimmed crush hat
he had at this moment made the motion again to remove it then had only pushed it back so that it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop
it was a touch that gave the note of the familiarthe intimate and the belatedto their quiet colloquy and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that strether became aware at the same moment of something else
the observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too fine to distinguish from so many others but it was none the less sharply determined
chad looked unmistakeably during these instantswell as strether put it to himself all he was worth
our friend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides be
he saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women and for a concentrated minute the dignity the comparative austerity as he funnily fancied it of this character affected him almost with awe
there was an experience on his interlocutor's part that looked out at him from under the displaced hat and that looked out moreover by a force of its own the deep fact of its quantity and quality and not through chad's intending bravado or swagger
that was then the way men marked out by women wereand also the men by whom the women were doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished
it affected strether for thirty seconds as a relevant truth a truth which however the next minute had fallen into its relation
can't you imagine there being some questions chad asked that a fellowhowever much impressed by your charming way of stating thingswould like to put to you first
oh yeseasily
i'm here to answer everything
i think i can even tell you things of the greatest interest to you that you won't know enough to ask me
we'll take as many days to it as you like
but i want strether wound up to go to bed now
really
chad had spoken in such surprise that he was amused
can't you believe itwith what you put me through
the young man seemed to consider
oh i haven't put you through muchyet
do you mean there's so much more to come
strether laughed
all the more reason then that i should gird myself
and as if to mark what he felt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet
chad still seated stayed him with a hand against him as he passed between their table and the next
oh we shall get on
the tone was as who should say everything strether could have desired and quite as good the expression of face with which the speaker had looked up at him and kindly held him
all these things lacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience
yes experience was what chad did play on him if he didn't play any grossness of defiance
of course experience was in a manner defiance but it wasn't at any raterather indeed quite the contrarygrossness which was so much gained
he fairly grew older strether thought while he himself so reasoned
then with his mature pat of his visitor's arm he also got up and there had been enough of it all by this time to make the visitor feel that something was settled
wasn't it settled that he had at least the testimony of chad's own belief in a settlement
strether found himself treating chad's profession that they would get on as a sufficient basis for going to bed
he hadn't nevertheless after this gone to bed directly for when they had again passed out together into the mild bright night a check had virtually sprung from nothing more than a small circumstance which might have acted only as confirming quiescence
there were people expressive sound projected light still abroad and after they had taken in for a moment through everything the great clear architectural street they turned off in tacit union to the quarter of strether's hotel
of course chad here abruptly began of course mother's making things out with you about me has been naturaland of course also you've had a good deal to go upon
still you must have filled out
he had stopped leaving his friend to wonder a little what point he wished to make and this it was that enabled strether meanwhile to make one
oh we've never pretended to go into detail
we weren't in the least bound to that
it was 'filling out' enough to miss you as we did
but chad rather oddly insisted though under the high lamp at their corner where they paused he had at first looked as if touched by strether's allusion to the long sense at home of his absence
what i mean is you must have imagined
imagined what
wellhorrors
it affected strether  horrors were so littlesuperficially at leastin this robust and reasoning image
but he was none the less there to be veracious
yes i dare say we have imagined horrors
but where's the harm if we haven't been wrong
chad raised his face to the lamp and it was one of the moments at which he had in his extraordinary way most his air of designedly showing himself
it was as if at these instants he just presented himself his identity so rounded off his palpable presence and his massive young manhood as such a link in the chain as might practically amount to a kind of demonstration
it was as ifand how but anomalouslyhe couldn't after all help thinking sufficiently well of these things to let them go for what they were worth
what could there be in this for strether but the hint of some selfrespect some sense of power oddly perverted something latent and beyond access ominous and perhaps enviable
the intimation had the next thing in a flash taken on a namea name on which our friend seized as he asked himself if he weren't perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young pagan
this descriptionhe quite jumped at ithad a sound that gratified his mental ear so that of a sudden he had already adopted it
paganyes that was wasn't it
what chad would logically be
it was what he must be
it was what he was
the idea was a clue and instead of darkening the prospect projected a certain clearness
strether made out in this quick ray that a pagan was perhaps at the pass they had come to the thing most wanted at woollett
they'd be able to do with onea good one he'd find an openingyes and strether's imagination even now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the rousing personage
he had only the slight discomfort of feeling as the young man turned away from the lamp that his thought had in the momentary silence possibly been guessed
well i've no doubt said chad you've come near enough
the details as you say don't matter
it has been generally the case that i've let myself go
but i'm coming roundi'm not so bad now
with which they walked on again to strether's hotel
do you mean the latter asked as they approached the door that there isn't any woman with you now
but pray what has that to do with it
why it's the whole question
of my going home
chad was clearly surprised
oh not much
do you think that when i want to go any one will have any power  to keep youstrether took him straight upfrom carrying out your wish
well our idea has been that somebody has hithertoor a good many persons perhapskept you pretty well from 'wanting'
that's whatif you're in anybody's handsmay again happen
you don't answer my questionhe kept it up but if you aren't in anybody's hands so much the better
there's nothing then but what makes for your going
chad turned this over
i don't answer your question
he spoke quite without resenting it
well such questions have always a rather exaggerated side
one doesn't know quite what you mean by being in women's 'hands'
it's all so vague
one is when one isn't
one isn't when one is
and then one can't quite give people away
he seemed kindly to explain
i've never got stuckso very hard and as against anything at any time really better i don't think i've ever been afraid
there was something in it that held strether to wonder and this gave him time to go on
he broke out as with a more helpful thought
don't you know how i like paris itself
the upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel
oh if that's all that's the matter with you
it was he who almost showed resentment
chad's smile of a truth more than met it
but isn't that enough
strether hesitated but it came out
not enough for your mother
spoken however it sounded a trifle oddthe effect of which was that chad broke into a laugh
strether at this succumbed as well though with extreme brevity
permit us to have still our theory
but if you are so free and so strong you're inexcusable
i'll write in the morning he added with decision
i'll say i've got you
this appeared to open for chad a new interest
how often do you write
oh perpetually
and at great length
strether had become a little impatient
i hope it's not found too great
oh i'm sure not
and you hear as often
again strether paused
as often as i deserve
mother writes said chad a lovely letter
strether before the closed portecochere fixed him a moment
it's more my boy than you do
but our suppositions don't matter he added if you're actually not entangled
chad's pride seemed none the less a little touched
i never was thatlet me insist
i always had my own way
with which he pursued and i have it at present
then what are you here for
what has kept you strether asked if you have been able to leave
it made chad after a stare throw himself back
do you think one's kept only by women
his surprise and his verbal emphasis rang out so clear in the still street that strether winced till he remembered the safety of their english speech
is that the young man demanded what they think at woollett
at the good faith in the question strether had changed colour feeling that as he would have said he had put his foot in it
he had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what they thought at woollett but before he had time to rectify chad again was upon him
i must say then you show a low mind
it so fell in unhappily for strether with that reflexion of his own prompted in him by the pleasant air of the boulevard malesherbes that its disconcerting force was rather unfairly great
it was a dig that administered by himselfand administered even to poor mrs newsomewas no more than salutary but administered by chadand quite logicallyit came nearer drawing blood
they hadn't a low mindnor any approach to one yet incontestably they had worked and with a certain smugness on a basis that might be turned against them
chad had at any rate pulled his visitor up he had even pulled up his admirable mother he had absolutely by a turn of the wrist and a jerk of the farflung noose pulled up in a bunch woollett browsing in its pride
there was no doubt woollett had insisted on his coarseness and what he at present stood there for in the sleeping street was by his manner of striking the other note to make of such insistence a preoccupation compromising to the insisters
it was exactly as if they had imputed to him a vulgarity that he had by a mere gesture caused to fall from him
the devil of the case was that strether felt it by the same stroke as falling straight upon himself
he had been wondering a minute ago if the boy weren't a pagan and he found himself wondering now if he weren't by chance a gentleman
it didn't in the least on the spot spring up helpfully for him that a person couldn't at the same time be both
there was nothing at this moment in the air to challenge the combination there was everything to give it on the contrary something of a flourish
it struck strether into the bargain as doing something to meet the most difficult of the questions though perhaps indeed only by substituting another
wouldn't it be precisely by having learned to be a gentleman that he had mastered the consequent trick of looking so well that one could scarce speak to him straight
but what in the world was the clue to such a prime producing cause
there were too many clues then that strether still lacked and these clues to clues were among them
what it accordingly amounted to for him was that he had to take full in the face a fresh attribution of ignorance
he had grown used by this time to reminders especially from his own lips of what he didn't know but he had borne them because in the first place they were private and because in the second they practically conveyed a tribute
he didn't know what was bad andas others didn't know how little he knew ithe could put up with his state
but if he didn't know in so important a particular what was good chad at least was now aware he didn't and that for some reason affected our friend as curiously public
it was in fact an exposed condition that the young man left him in long enough for him to feel its chilltill he saw fit in a word generously again to cover him
this last was in truth what chad quite gracefully did
but he did it as with a simple thought that met the whole of the case
oh i'm all right
it was what strether had rather bewilderedly to go to bed on
ii   it really looked true moreover from the way chad was to behave after this
he was full of attentions to his mother's ambassador in spite of which all the while the latter's other relations rather remarkably contrived to assert themselves
strether's sittings pen in hand with mrs newsome up in his own room were broken yet they were richer and they were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he reported himself in a different fashion but with scarce less earnestness and fulness to maria gostrey
now that as he would have expressed it he had really something to talk about he found himself in respect to any oddity that might reside for him in the double connexion at once more aware and more indifferent
he had been fine to mrs newsome about his useful friend but it had begun to haunt his imagination that chad taking up again for her benefit a pen too long disused might possibly be finer
it wouldn't at all do he saw that anything should come up for him at chad's hand but what specifically was to have come the greatest divergence from which would be precisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by levity it was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he frankly put before the young man the several facts just as they had occurred of his funny alliance
he spoke of these facts pleasantly and obligingly as the whole story and felt that he might qualify the alliance as funny if he remained sufficiently grave about it
he flattered himself that he even exaggerated the wild freedom of his original encounter with the wonderful lady he was scrupulously definite about the absurd conditions in which they had made acquaintancetheir having picked each other up almost in the street and he had finest inspiration of all
a conception of carrying the war into the enemy's country by showing surprise at the enemy's ignorance
he had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of fighting the greater therefore the reason for it as he couldn't remember that he had ever before fought in the grand style
every one according to this knew miss gostrey  how came it chad didn't know her
the difficulty the impossibility was really to escape it strether put on him by what he took for granted the burden of proof of the contrary
this tone was so far successful as that chad quite appeared to recognise her as a person whose fame had reached him but against his acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked
he made the point at the same time that his social relations such as they could be called were perhaps not to the extent strether supposed with the rising flood of their compatriots
he hinted at his having more and more given way to a different principle of selection the moral of which seemed to be that he went about little in the colony
for the moment certainly he had quite another interest
it was deep what he understood and strether for himself could only so observe it
he couldn't see as yet how deep
might he not all too soon
for there was really too much of their question that chad had already committed himself to liking
he liked to begin with his prospective stepfather which was distinctly what had not been on the cards
his hating him was the untowardness for which strether had been best prepared he hadn't expected the boy's actual form to give him more to do than his imputed
it gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to himself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable
that had really been present to him as his only way to be sure he was sufficiently thorough
the point was that if chad's tolerance of his thoroughness were insincere were but the best of devices for gaining time it none the less did treat everything as tacitly concluded
that seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant the recurrent talk through which strether poured into him all it concerned him to know put him in full possession of facts and figures
never cutting these colloquies short by a minute chad behaved looked and spoke as if he were rather heavily perhaps even a trifle gloomily but none the less fundamentally and comfortably free
he made no crude profession of eagerness to yield but he asked the most intelligent questions probed at moments abruptly even deeper than his friend's layer of information justified by these touches the native estimate of his latent stuff and had in every way the air of trying to live reflectively into the square bright picture
he walked up and down in front of this production sociably took strether's arm at the points at which he stopped surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left inclined a critical head to either quarter and while he puffed a still more critical cigarette animadverted to his companion on this passage and that
strether sought reliefthere were hours when he required itin repeating himself it was in truth not to be blinked that chad had a way
the main question as yet was of what it was a way to
it made vulgar questions no more easy but that was unimportant when all questions save those of his own asking had dropped
that he was free was answer enough and it wasn't quite ridiculous that this freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move
his changed state his lovely home his beautiful things his easy talk his very appetite for strether insatiable and when all was said flatteringwhat were such marked matters all but the notes of his freedom
he had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these handsome forms to his visitor which was mainly the reason the visitor was privately for the time a little out of countenance
strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel somehow his plan
he fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances shy looks of pursuit toward the embodied influence the definite adversary who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond theory of whose palpable presence he had under mrs newsome's inspiration altogether proceeded
he had once or twice in secret literally expressed the irritated wish that she would come out and find her
he couldn't quite yet force it upon woollett that such a career such a perverted young life showed after all a certain plausible side did in the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the social man but he could at least treat himself to the statement that would prepare him for the sharpest echo
this echoas distinct over there in the dry thin air as some shrill heading above a column of printseemed to reach him even as he wrote
he says there's no woman he could hear mrs newsome report in capitals almost of newspaper size to mrs pocock and he could focus in mrs pocock the response of the reader of the journal
he could see in the younger lady's face the earnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but slightly delayed what is there then
just so he could again as little miss the mother's clear decision  there's plenty of disposition no doubt to pretend there isn't
strether had after posting his letter the whole scene out and it was a scene during which coming and going as befell he kept his eye not least upon the daughter
he had his fine sense of the conviction mrs pocock would take occasion to reaffirma conviction bearing as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear on mr strether's essential inaptitude
she had looked him in his conscious eyes even before he sailed and that she didn't believe he would find the woman had been written in her book
hadn't she at the best but a scant faith in his ability to find women
it wasn't even as if he had found her motherso much more to her discrimination had her mother performed the finding
her mother had in a case her private judgement of which remained educative of mrs pocock's critical sense found the man
the man owed his unchallenged state in general to the fact that mrs newsome's discoveries were accepted at woollett but he knew in his bones our friend did how almost irresistibly mrs pocock would now be moved to show what she thought of his own
give her a free hand would be the moral and the woman would soon be found
his impression of miss gostrey after her introduction to chad was meanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her guard
he struck himself as at first unable to extract from her what he wished though indeed of what he wished at this special juncture he would doubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement
it sifted and settled nothing to put to her tout betement as she often said do you like him eh
thanks to his feeling it actually the least of his needs to heap up the evidence in the young man's favour
he repeatedly knocked at her door to let her have it afresh that chad's casewhatever else of minor interest it might yieldwas first and foremost a miracle almost monstrous
it was the alteration of the entire man and was so signal an instance that nothing else for the intelligent observer couldcould itsignify
it's a plot he declaredthere's more in it than meets the eye
he gave the rein to his fancy
it's a plant
his fancy seemed to please her
whose then
well the party responsible is i suppose the fate that waits for one the dark doom that rides
what i mean is that with such elements one can't count
i've but my poor individual my modest human means
it isn't playing the game to turn on the uncanny
all one's energy goes to facing it to tracking it
one wants confound it don't you see
he confessed with a queer faceone wants to enjoy anything so rare
call it then lifehe puzzled it outcall it poor dear old life simply that springs the surprise
nothing alters the fact that the surprise is paralysing or at any rate engrossingall practically hang it that one sees that one can see
her silences were never barren nor even dull
is that what you've written home
he tossed it off
oh dear yes
she had another pause while across her carpets he had another walk
if you don't look out you'll have them straight over
oh but i've said he'll go back
and will he
miss gostrey asked
the special tone of it made him pulling up look at her long
what's that but just the question i've spent treasures of patience and ingenuity in giving you by the sight of himafter everything had led upevery facility to answer
what is it but just the thing i came here today to get out of you
will he
nohe won't she said at last
he's not free
the air of it held him
then you've all the while known
i've known nothing but what i've seen and i wonder she declared with some impatience that you didn't see as much
it was enough to be with him there  in the box
yes he rather blankly urged
wellto feel sure
sure of what
she got up from her chair at this with a nearer approach than she had ever yet shown to dismay at his dimness
she even fairly pausing for it spoke with a shade of pity
guess
it was a shade fairly that brought a flush into his face so that for a moment as they waited together their difference was between them
you mean that just your hour with him told you so much of his story
very good i'm not such a fool on my side as that i don't understand you or as that i didn't in some degree understand him
that he has done what he liked most isn't among any of us a matter the least in dispute
there's equally little question at this time of day of what it is he does like most
but i'm not talking he reasonably explained of any mere wretch he may still pick up
i'm talking of some person who in his present situation may have held her own may really have counted
that's exactly what i am
said miss gostrey
but she as quickly made her point
i thought you thoughtor that they think at woollettthat that's what mere wretches necessarily do
mere wretches necessarily don't
she declared with spirit
there must behind every appearance to the contrary still be somebodysomebody who's not a mere wretch since we accept the miracle
what else but such a somebody can such a miracle be
he took it in
because the fact itself is the woman
a woman
some woman or other
it's one of the things that have to be
but you mean then at least a good one
a good woman
she threw up her arms with a laugh
i should call her excellent
then why does he deny her
miss gostrey thought a moment
because she's too good to admit
don't you see she went on how she accounts for him
strether clearly more and more did see yet it made him also see other things
but isn't what we want that he shall account for her
well he does
what you have before you is his way
you must forgive him if it isn't quite outspoken
in paris such debts are tacit
strether could imagine but still
even when the woman's good
again she laughed out
yes and even when the man is
there's always a caution in such cases she more seriously explainedfor what it may seem to show
there's nothing that's taken as showing so much here as sudden unnatural goodness
ah then you're speaking now strether said of people who are not nice
i delight she replied in your classifications
but do you want me she asked to give you in the matter on this ground the wisest advice i'm capable of
don't consider her don't judge her at all in herself
consider her and judge her only in chad
he had the courage at least of his companion's logic
because then i shall like her
he almost looked with his quick imagination as if he already did though seeing at once also the full extent of how little it would suit his book
but is that what i came out for
she had to confess indeed that it wasn't
but there was something else
don't make up your mind
there are all sorts of things
you haven't seen him all
this on his side strether recognised but his acuteness none the less showed him the danger
yes but if the more i see the better he seems
well she found something
that may bebut his disavowal of her isn't all the same pure consideration
there's a hitch
she made it out
it's the effort to sink her
strether winced at the image
to 'sink'
well i mean there's a struggle and a part of it is just what he hides
take timethat's the only way not to make some mistake that you'll regret
then you'll see
he does really want to shake her off
our friend had by this time so got into the vision that he almost gasped
after all she has done for him
miss gostrey gave him a look which broke the next moment into a wonderful smile
he's not so good as you think
they remained with him these words promising him in their character of warning considerable help but the support he tried to draw from them found itself on each renewal of contact with chad defeated by something else
what could it be this disconcerting force he asked himself but the sense constantly renewed that chad wasquite in fact insisted on beingas good as he thought
it seemed somehow as if he couldn't but be as good from the moment he wasn't as bad
there was a succession of days at all events when contact with himand in its immediate effect as if it could produce no otherelbowed out of strether's consciousness everything but itself
little bilham once more pervaded the scene but little bilham became even in a higher degree than he had originally been one of the numerous forms of the inclusive relation a consequence promoted to our friend's sense by two or three incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance
waymarsh himself for the occasion was drawn into the eddy it absolutely though but temporarily swallowed him down and there were days when strether seemed to bump against him as a sinking swimmer might brush a submarine object
the fathomless medium held themchad's manner was the fathomless medium and our friend felt as if they passed each other in their deep immersion with the round impersonal eye of silent fish
it was practically produced between them that waymarsh was giving him then his chance and the shade of discomfort that strether drew from the allowance resembled not a little the embarrassment he had known at school as a boy when members of his family had been present at exhibitions
he could perform before strangers but relatives were fatal and it was now as if comparatively waymarsh were a relative
he seemed to hear him say strike up then
and to enjoy a foretaste of conscientious domestic criticism
he had struck up so far as he actually could chad knew by this time in profusion what he wanted and what vulgar violence did his fellow pilgrim expect of him when he had really emptied his mind
it went somehow to and fro that what poor waymarsh meant was i told you sothat you'd lose your immortal soul
but it was also fairly explicit that strether had his own challenge and that since they must go to the bottom of things he wasted no more virtue in watching chad than chad wasted in watching him
his dip for duty's sakewhere was it worse than waymarsh's own
for he needn't have stopped resisting and refusing needn't have parleyed at that rate with the foe
the strolls over paris to see something or call somewhere were accordingly inevitable and natural and the late sessions in the wondrous troisieme the lovely home when men dropped in and the picture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco of music more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot were on a principle not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the afternoons
nothing strether had to recognise as he leaned back and smoked could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the liveliest of these occasions
they were occasions of discussion none the less and strether had never in his life heard so many opinions on so many subjects
there were opinions at woollett but only on three or four
the differences were there to match if they were doubtless deep though few they were quietthey were as might be said almost as shy as if people had been ashamed of them
people showed little diffidence about such things on the other hand in the boulevard malesherbes and were so far from being ashamed of themor indeed of anything elsethat they often seemed to have invented them to avert those agreements that destroy the taste of talk
no one had ever done that at woollett though strether could remember times when he himself had been tempted to it without quite knowing why
he saw why at presenthe had but wanted to promote intercourse
these however were but parenthetic memories and the turn taken by his affair on the whole was positively that if his nerves were on the stretch it was because he missed violence
when he asked himself if none would then in connexion with it ever come at all he might almost have passed as wondering how to provoke it
it would be too absurd if such a vision as that should have to be invoked for relief it was already marked enough as absurd that he should actually have begun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted meal
what sort of a brute had he expected chad to be anywaystrether had occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to make it in private
he could himself comparatively recent as it wasit was truly but the fact of a few days sincefocus his primal crudity but he would on the approach of an observer as if handling an illicit possession have slipped the reminiscence out of sight
there were echoes of it still in mrs newsome's letters and there were moments when these echoes made him exclaim on her want of tact
he blushed of course at once still more for the explanation than for the ground of it  it came to him in time to save his manners that she couldn't at the best become tactful as quickly as he
her tact had to reckon with the atlantic ocean the general postoffice and the extravagant curve of the globe
chad had one day offered tea at the boulevard malesherbes to a chosen few a group again including the unobscured miss barrace and strether had on coming out walked away with the acquaintance whom in his letters to mrs newsome he always spoke of as the little artistman
he had had full occasion to mention him as the other party so oddly to the only close personal alliance observation had as yet detected in chad's existence
little bilham's way this afternoon was not strether's but he had none the less kindly come with him and it was somehow a part of his kindness that as it had sadly begun to rain they suddenly found themselves seated for conversation at a cafe in which they had taken refuge
he had passed no more crowded hour in chad's society than the one just ended he had talked with miss barrace who had reproached him with not having come to see her and he had above all hit on a happy thought for causing waymarsh's tension to relax
something might possibly be extracted for the latter from the idea of his success with that lady whose quick apprehension of what might amuse her had given strether a free hand
what had she meant if not to ask whether she couldn't help him with his splendid encumbrance and mightn't the sacred rage at any rate be kept a little in abeyance by thus creating for his comrade's mind even in a world of irrelevance the possibility of a relation
what was it but a relation to be regarded as so decorative and in especial on the strength of it to be whirled away amid flounces and feathers in a coupe lined by what strether could make out with dark blue brocade
he himself had never been whirled awaynever at least in a coupe and behind a footman he had driven with miss gostrey in cabs with mrs pocock a few times in an open buggy with mrs newsome in a fourseated cart and occasionally up at the mountains on a buckboard but his friend's actual adventure transcended his personal experience
he now showed his companion soon enough indeed how inadequate as a general monitor this last queer quantity could once more feel itself
what game under the sun is he playing
he signified the next moment that his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on whom his eyes had begun by resting but to their host of the previous hour as to whom there on the velvet bench with a final collapse of all consistency he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion
where do you see him come out
little bilham in meditation looked at him with a kindness almost paternal
don't you like it over here
strether laughed outfor the tone was indeed droll he let himself go
what has that to do with it
the only thing i've any business to like is to feel that i'm moving him
that's why i ask you whether you believe i am
is the creatureand he did his best to show that he simply wished to ascertainhonest
his companion looked responsible but looked it through a small dim smile
what creature do you mean
it was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange
is it untrue that he's free
how then strether asked wondering does he arrange his life
is the creature you mean chad himself
little bilham said
strether here with a rising hope just thought we must take one of them at a time
but his coherence lapsed
is there some woman
of whom he's really afraid of course i meanor who does with him what she likes
it's awfully charming of you bilham presently remarked not to have asked me that before
oh i'm not fit for my job
the exclamation had escaped our friend but it made little bilham more deliberate
chad's a rare case
he luminously observed
he's awfully changed he added
then you see it too
the way he has improved
oh yesi think every one must see it
but i'm not sure said little bilham that i didn't like him about as well in his other state
then this is really a new state altogether
well the young man after a moment returned i'm not sure he was really meant by nature to be quite so good
it's like the new edition of an old book that one has been fond ofrevised and amended brought up to date but not quite the thing one knew and loved
however that may be at all events he pursued i don't think you know that he's really playing as you call it any game
i believe he really wants to go back and take up a career
he's capable of one you know that will improve and enlarge him still more
he won't then little bilham continued to remark be my pleasant wellrubbed oldfashioned volume at all
but of course i'm beastly immoral
i'm afraid it would be a funny world altogethera world with things the way i like them
i ought i dare say to go home and go into business myself
only i'd simply rather diesimply
and i've not the least difficulty in making up my mind not to and in knowing exactly why and in defending my ground against all comers
all the same he wound up i assure you i don't say a word against itfor himself i meanto chad
i seem to see it as much the best thing for him
you see he's not happy
do i
strether stared
i've been supposing i see just the oppositean extraordinary case of the equilibrium arrived at and assured
oh there's a lot behind it
ah there you are
strether exclaimed
that's just what i want to get at
you speak of your familiar volume altered out of recognition
well who's the editor
little bilham looked before him a minute in silence
he ought to get married
that would do it
and he wants to
wants to marry her
again little bilham waited and with a sense that he had information strether scarce knew what was coming
he wants to be free
he isn't used you see the young man explained in his lucid way to being so good
strether hesitated
then i may take it from you that he is good
his companion matched his pause but making it up with a quiet fulness
do take it from me
well then why isn't he free
he swears to me he is but meanwhile does nothingexcept of course that he's so kind to meto prove it and couldn't really act much otherwise if he weren't
my question to you just now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy  as if instead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and set me a bad example
as the halfhour meanwhile had ebbed strether paid his score and the waiter was presently in the act of counting out change
our friend pushed back to him a fraction of it with which after an emphatic recognition the personage in question retreated
you give too much little bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe
oh i always give too much
strether helplessly sighed
but you don't he went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of that doom answer my question
why isn't he free
little bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been a signal and had already edged out between the table and the divan
the effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place the gratified waiter alert again at the open door
strether had found himself deferring to his companion's abruptness as to a hint that he should be answered as soon as they were more isolated
this happened when after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next comer
there our friend had kept it up
why isn't he free if he's good
little bilham looked him full in the face
because it's a virtuous attachment
this had settled the question so effectually for the timethat is for the next few daysthat it had given strether almost a new lease of life
it must be added however that thanks to his constant habit of shaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience he presently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his draught
his imagination had in other words already dealt with his young friend's assertion of which it had made something that sufficiently came out on the very next occasion of his seeing maria gostrey
this occasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstancea circumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance of
when i said to him last night he immediately began that without some definite word from him now that will enable me to speak to them over there of our sailingor at least of mine giving them some sort of datemy responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation awkward when i said that to him what do you think was his reply
and then as she this time gave it up  why that he has two particular friends two ladies mother and daughter about to arrive in pariscoming back from an absence and that he wants me so furiously to meet them know them and like them that i shall oblige him by kindly not bringing our business to a crisis till he has had a chance to see them again himself
is that strether enquired the way he's going to try to get off
these are the people he explained that he must have gone down to see before i arrived
they're the best friends he has in the world and they take more interest than any one else in what concerns him
as i'm his next best he sees a thousand reasons why we should comfortably meet
he hasn't broached the question sooner because their return was uncertainseemed in fact for the present impossible
but he more than intimates thatif you can believe ittheir desire to make my acquaintance has had to do with their surmounting difficulties
they're dying to see you
miss gostrey asked
dying
of course said strether they're the virtuous attachment
he had already told her about thathad seen her the day after his talk with little bilham and they had then threshed out together the bearing of the revelation
she had helped him to put into it the logic in which little bilham had left it slightly deficient strether hadn't pressed him as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described feeling in the presence of it with one of his irrepressible scruples a delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article worked himself sufficiently free
he had held off as on a small principle of pride from permitting his young friend to mention a name wishing to make with this the great point that chad's virtuous attachments were none of his business
he had wanted from the first not to think too much of his dignity but that was no reason for not allowing it any little benefit that might turn up
he had often enough wondered to what degree his interference might pass for interested so that there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he could that he didn't interfere
that had of course at the same time not deprived him of the further luxury of much private astonishment which however he had reduced to some order before communicating his knowledge
when he had done this at last it was with the remark that surprised as miss gostrey might like himself at first be she would probably agree with him on reflexion that such an account of the matter did after all fit the confirmed appearances
nothing certainly on all the indications could have been a greater change for him than a virtuous attachment and since they had been in search of the word as the french called it of that change little bilham's announcementthough so long and so oddly delayedwould serve as well as another
she had assured strether in fact after a pause that the more she thought of it the more it did serve and yet her assurance hadn't so weighed with him as that before they parted he hadn't ventured to challenge her sincerity
didn't she believe the attachment was virtuoushe had made sure of her again with the aid of that question
the tidings he brought her on this second occasion were moreover such as would help him to make surer still
she showed at first none the less as only amused
you say there are two
an attachment to them both then would i suppose almost necessarily be innocent
our friend took the point but he had his clue
mayn't he be still in the stage of not quite knowing which of them mother or daughter he likes best
she gave it more thought
oh it must be the daughterat his age
possibly
yet what do we know strether asked about hers
she may be old enough
old enough for what
why to marry chad
that may be you know what they want
and if chad wants it too and little bilham wants it and even we at a pinch could do with itthat is if she doesn't prevent repatriationwhy it may be plain sailing yet
it was always the case for him in these counsels that each of his remarks as it came seemed to drop into a deeper well
he had at all events to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one
i don't see why if mr newsome wants to marry the young lady he hasn't already done it or hasn't been prepared with some statement to you about it
and if he both wants to marry her and is on good terms with them why isn't he 'free'
strether responsively wondered indeed
perhaps the girl herself doesn't like him
then why does he speak of them to you as he does
strether's mind echoed the question but also again met it
perhaps it's with the mother he's on good terms
as against the daughter
well if she's trying to persuade the daughter to consent to him what could make him like the mother more
only strether threw out why shouldn't the daughter consent to him
oh said miss gostrey mayn't it be that every one else isn't quite so struck with him as you
doesn't regard him you mean as such an 'eligible' young man
is that what i've come to
he audibly and rather gravely sought to know
however he went on his marriage is what his mother most desiresthat is if it will help
and oughtn't any marriage to help
they must want himhe had already worked it outto be better off
almost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking up his chances
it won't suit her at least that he shall miss them
miss gostrey cast about
noyou reason well
but of course on the other hand there's always dear old woollett itself
oh yes he musedthere's always dear old woollett itself
she waited a moment
the young lady mayn't find herself able to swallow that quantity
she may think it's paying too much she may weigh one thing against another
strether ever restless in such debates took a vague turn it will all depend on who she is
that of coursethe proved ability to deal with dear old woollett since i'm sure she does deal with itis what makes so strongly for mamie
mamie
he stopped short at her tone before her then though seeing that it represented not vagueness but a momentary embarrassed fulness let his exclamation come
you surely haven't forgotten about mamie
no i haven't forgotten about mamie she smiled
there's no doubt whatever that there's ever so much to be said for her
mamie's my girl
she roundly declared
strether resumed for a minute his walk
she's really perfectly lovely you know
far prettier than any girl i've seen over here yet
that's precisely on what i perhaps most build
and she mused a moment in her friend's way
i should positively like to take her in hand
he humoured the fancy though indeed finally to deprecate it
oh but don't in your zeal go over to her
i need you most and can't you know be left
but she kept it up
i wish they'd send her out to me
if they knew you he returned they would
ah but don't theyafter all that as i've understood you you've told them about me
he had paused before her again but he continued his course they willbefore as you say i've done
then he came out with the point he had wished after all most to make
it seems to give away now his game
this is what he has been doingkeeping me along for
he has been waiting for them
miss gostrey drew in her lips
you see a good deal in it
i doubt if i see as much as you
do you pretend he went on that you don't see
well what
she pressed him as he paused
why that there must be a lot between themand that it has been going on from the first even from before i came
she took a minute to answer
who are they thenif it's so grave
it mayn't be graveit may be gay
but at any rate it's marked
only i don't know strether had to confess anything about them
their name for instance was a thing that after little bilham's information i found it a kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up
oh she returned if you think you've got off
her laugh produced in him a momentary gloom
i don't think i've got off
i only think i'm breathing for about five minutes
i dare say i shall have at the best still to get on
a look over it all passed between them and the next minute he had come back to good humour
i don't meanwhile take the smallest interest in their name
nor in their nationalityamerican french english polish
i don't care the least little 'hang' he smiled for their nationality
it would be nice if they're polish
he almost immediately added
very nice indeed
the transition kept up her spirits
so you see you do care
he did this contention a modified justice
i think i should if they were polish
yes he thoughtthere might be joy in that
let us then hope for it
but she came after this nearer to the question
if the girl's of the right age of course the mother can't be
i mean for the virtuous attachment
if the girl's twentyand she can't be lessthe mother must be at least forty
so it puts the mother out
she's too old for him
strether arrested again considered and demurred
do you think so
do you think any one would be too old for him
i'm eighty and i'm too young
but perhaps the girl he continued isn't twenty
perhaps she's only tenbut such a little dear that chad finds himself counting her in as an attraction of the acquaintance
perhaps she's only five
perhaps the mother's but fiveandtwentya charming young widow
miss gostrey entertained the suggestion
she is a widow then
i haven't the least idea
they once more in spite of this vagueness exchanged a looka look that was perhaps the longest yet
it seemed in fact the next thing to require to explain itself which it did as it could
i only feel what i've told youthat he has some reason
miss gostrey's imagination had taken its own flight
perhaps she's not a widow
strether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve
still he accepted it
then that's why the attachmentif it's to heris virtuous
but she looked as if she scarce followed
why is it virtuous ifsince she's freethere's nothing to impose on it any condition
he laughed at her question
oh i perhaps don't mean as virtuous as that
your idea is that it can be virtuousin any sense worthy of the nameonly if she's not free
but what does it become then he asked for her
ah that's another matter
he said nothing for a moment and she soon went on
i dare say you're right at any rate about mr newsome's little plan
he has been trying youhas been reporting on you to these friends
strether meanwhile had had time to think more
then where's his straightness
well as we say it's struggling up breaking out asserting itself as it can
we can be on the side you see of his straightness
we can help him
but he has made out said miss gostrey that you'll do
do for what
why for themfor ces dames
he has watched you studied you liked youand recognised that they must
it's a great compliment to you my dear man for i'm sure they're particular
you came out for a success
well she gaily declared you're having it
he took it from her with momentary patience and then turned abruptly away
it was always convenient to him that there were so many fine things in her room to look at
but the examination of two or three of them appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do with them
you don't believe in it
in what
in the character of the attachment
in its innocence
but she defended herself
i don't pretend to know anything about it
everything's possible
we must see
see
he echoed with a groan
haven't we seen enough
i haven't she smiled
but do you suppose then little bilham has lied
you must find out
it made him almost turn pale
find out any more
he had dropped on a sofa for dismay but she seemed as she stood over him to have the last word
wasn't what you came out for to find out all
book fifth     i   the sunday of the next week was a wonderful day and chad newsome had let his friend know in advance that he had provided for it
there had already been a question of his taking him to see the great gloriani who was at home on sunday afternoons and at whose house for the most part fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere but the project through some accident had not had instant effect and now revived in happier conditions
chad had made the point that the celebrated sculptor had a queer old garden for which the weatherspring at last frank and fairwas propitious and two or three of his other allusions had confirmed for strether the expectation of something special
he had by this time for all introductions and adventures let himself recklessly go cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed him he was showing at least himself
he could have wished indeed so far as this went that chad were less of a mere cicerone for he was not without the impressionnow that the vision of his game his plan his deep diplomacy did recurrently assert itselfof his taking refuge from the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing as our friend mentally phrased et panem et circenses
our friend continued to feel rather smothered in flowers though he made in his other moments the almost angry inference that this was only because of his odious ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty
he periodically assured himselffor his reactions were sharpthat he shouldn't reach the truth of anything till he had at least got rid of that
he had known beforehand that madame de vionnet and her daughter would probably be on view an intimation to that effect having constituted the only reference again made by chad to his good friends from the south
the effect of strether's talk about them with miss gostrey had been quite to consecrate his reluctance to pry something in the very air of chad's silencejudged in the light of that talkoffered it to him as a reserve he could markedly match
it shrouded them about with he scarce knew what a consideration a distinction he was in presence at any rateso far as it placed him thereof ladies and the one thing that was definite for him was that they themselves should be to the extent of his responsibility in presence of a gentleman
was it because they were very beautiful very clever or even very goodwas it for one of these reasons that chad was so to speak nursing his effect
did he wish to spring them in the woollett phrase with a fuller forceto confound his critic slight though as yet the criticism with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable
the most the critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question were french and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the sound of their name
yes
that is no
had been chad's reply but he had immediately added that their english was the most charming in the world so that if strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on with them he wouldn't in the least find one
never in fact had stretherin the mood into which the place had quickly launched himfelt for himself less the need of an excuse
those he might have found would have been at the worst all for the others the people before him in whose liberty to be as they were he was aware that he positively rejoiced
his fellow guests were multiplying and these things their liberty their intensity their variety their conditions at large were in fusion in the admirable medium of the scene
the place itself was a great impressiona small pavilion clearfaced and sequestered an effect of polished parquet of fine white panel and spare sallow gilt of decoration delicate and rare in the heart of the faubourg saintgermain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached to old noble houses
far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds reached by a long passage and a quiet court it was as striking to the unprepared mind he immediately saw as a treasure dug up giving him too more than anything yet the note of the range of the immeasurable town and sweeping away as by a last brave brush his usual landmarks and terms
it was in the garden a spacious cherished remnant out of which a dozen persons had already passed that chad's host presently met them while the tall birdhaunted trees all of a twitter with the spring and the weather and the high partywalls on the other side of which grave hotels stood off for privacy spoke of survival transmission association a strong indifferent persistent order
the day was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the open air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of state
strether had presently the sense of a great convent a convent of missions famous for he scarce knew what a nursery of young priests of scattered shade of straight alleys and chapelbells that spread its mass in one quarter he had the sense of names in the air of ghosts at the windows of signs and tokens a whole range of expression all about him too thick for prompt discrimination
this assault of images became for a moment in the address of the distinguished sculptor almost formidable  gloriani showed him in such perfect confidence on chad's introduction of him a fine worn handsome face a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue
with his genius in his eyes his manners on his lips his long career behind him and his honours and rewards all round the great artist in the course of a single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type
strether had seen in museumsin the luxembourg as well as more reverently later on in the new york of the billionairesthe work of his hand knowing too that after an earlier time in his native rome he had migrated in midcareer to paris where with a personal lustre almost violent he shone in a constellation  all of which was more than enough to crown him for his guest with the light with the romance of glory
strether in contact with that element as he had never yet so intimately been had the consciousness of opening to it for the happy instant all the windows of his mind of letting this rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old geography
he was to remember again repeatedly the medallike italian face in which every line was an artist's own in which time told only as tone and consecration and he was to recall in especial as the penetrating radiance as the communication of the illustrious spirit itself the manner in which while they stood briefly in welcome and response face to face he was held by the sculptor's eyes
he wasn't soon to forget them was to think of them all unconscious unintending preoccupied though they were as the source of the deepest intellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed
he was in fact quite to cherish his vision of it to play with it in idle hours only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn't have spoken without appearing to talk nonsense
was what it had told him or what it had asked him the greater of the mysteries
was it the most special flare unequalled supreme of the aesthetic torch lighting that wondrous world for ever or was it above all the long straight shaft sunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel
nothing on earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised than the artist himself but it was for all the world to strether just then as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on trial
the deep human expertness in gloriani's charming smileoh the terrible life behind itwas flashed upon him as a test of his stuff
chad meanwhile after having easily named his companion had still more easily turned away and was already greeting other persons present
he was as easy clever chad with the great artist as with his obscure compatriot and as easy with every one else as with either this fell into its place for strether and made almost a new light giving him as a concatenation something more he could enjoy
he liked gloriani but should never see him again of that he was sufficiently sure
chad accordingly who was wonderful with both of them was a kind of link for hopeless fancy an implication of possibilitiesoh if everything had been different
strether noted at all events that he was thus on terms with illustrious spirits and also thatyes distinctlyhe hadn't in the least swaggered about it
our friend hadn't come there only for this figure of abel newsome's son but that presence threatened to affect the observant mind as positively central
gloriani indeed remembering something and excusing himself pursued chad to speak to him and strether was left musing on many things
one of them was the question of whether since he had been tested he had passed
did the artist drop him from having made out that he wouldn't do
he really felt just today that he might do better than usual
hadn't he done well enough so far as that went in being exactly so dazzled
and in not having too as he almost believed wholly hidden from his host that he felt the latter's plummet
suddenly across the garden he saw little bilham approach and it was a part of the fit that was on him that as their eyes met he guessed also his knowledge
if he had said to him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said  have i passedfor of course i know one has to pass here
little bilham would have reassured him have told him that he exaggerated and have adduced happily enough the argument of little bilham's own very presence which in truth he could see was as easy a one as gloriani's own or as chad's
he himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be frightened would get the point of view for some of the facestypes tremendously alien alien to woollettthat he had already begun to take in
who were they all the dispersed groups and couples the ladies even more unlike those of woollett than the gentlementhis was the enquiry that when his young friend had greeted him he did find himself making
oh they're every oneall sorts and sizes of course i mean within limits though limits down perhaps rather more than limits up
there are always artistshe's beautiful and inimitable to the cher confrere and then gros bonnets of many kindsambassadors cabinet ministers bankers generals what do i know
even jews
above all always some awfully nice womenand not too many sometimes an actress an artist a great performerbut only when they're not monsters and in particular the right femmes du monde
you can fancy his history on that sidei believe it's fabulous they never give him up
yet he keeps them down  no one knows how he manages it's too beautiful and bland
never too manyand a mighty good thing too just a perfect choice
but there are not in any way many bores it has always been so he has some secret
it's extraordinary
and you don't find it out
he's the same to every one
he doesn't ask questions'
ah doesn't he
strether laughed
bilham met it with all his candour
how then should i be here
oh for what you tell me
you're part of the perfect choice
well the young man took in the scene
it seems rather good today
strether followed the direction of his eyes
are they all this time femmes du monde
little bilham showed his competence
pretty well
this was a category our friend had a feeling for a light romantic and mysterious on the feminine element in which he enjoyed for a little watching it
are there any poles
his companion considered
i think i make out a 'portuguee'
but i've seen turks
strether wondered desiring justice
they seemall the womenvery harmonious
oh in closer quarters they come out
and then while strether was aware of fearing closer quarters though giving himself again to the harmonies well little bilham went on it is at the worst rather good you know
if you like it you feel it this way that shows you're not in the least out but you always know things he handsomely added immediately
strether liked it and felt it only too much so i say don't lay traps for me
he rather helplessly murmured
well his companion returned he's wonderfully kind to us
to us americans you mean
oh nohe doesn't know anything about that
that's half the battle herethat you can never hear politics
we don't talk them
i mean to poor young wretches of all sorts
and yet it's always as charming as this it's as if by something in the air our squalor didn't show
it puts us all backinto the last century
i'm afraid strether said amused that it puts me rather forward oh ever so far
into the next
but isn't that only little bilham asked because you're really of the century before
the century before the last
thank you
strether laughed
if i ask you about some of the ladies it can't be then that i may hope as such a specimen of the rococo to please them
on the contrary they adorewe all adore herethe rococo and where is there a better setting for it than the whole thing the pavilion and the garden together
there are lots of people with collections little bilham smiled as he glanced round
you'll be secured
it made strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation
there were faces he scarce knew what to make of
were they charming or were they only strange
he mightn't talk politics yet he suspected a pole or two
the upshot was the question at the back of his head from the moment his friend had joined him
have madame de vionnet and her daughter arrived
i haven't seen them yet but miss gostrey has come
she's in the pavilion looking at objects
one can see she's a collector little bilham added without offence
oh yes she's a collector and i knew she was to come
is madame de vionnet a collector
strether went on
rather i believe almost celebrated
the young man met on it a little his friend's eyes
i happen to knowfrom chad whom i saw last nightthat they've come back but only yesterday
he wasn't sureup to the last
this accordingly little bilham went on will beif they are heretheir first appearance after their return
strether very quickly turned these things over
chad told you last night
to me on our way here he said nothing about it
but did you ask him
strether did him the justice
i dare say not
well said little bilham you're not a person to whom it's easy to tell things you don't want to know
though it is easy i admitit's quite beautiful he benevolently added when you do want to
strether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his intelligence
is that the deep reasoning on whichabout these ladiesyou've been yourself so silent
little bilham considered the depth of his reasoning
i haven't been silent
i spoke of them to you the other day the day we sat together after chad's teaparty
strether came round to it
they then are the virtuous attachment
i can only tell you that it's what they pass for
but isn't that enough
what more than a vain appearance does the wisest of us know
i commend you the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis the vain appearance
strether looked more widely round and what he saw from face to face deepened the effect of his young friend's words
is it so good
magnificent
strether had a pause
the husband's dead
dear no
alive
oh
said strether
after which as his companion laughed how then can it be so good
you'll see for yourself
one does see
chad's in love with the daughter
that's what i mean
strether wondered
then where's the difficulty
why aren't you and iwith our grander bolder ideas
oh mine
strether said rather strangely
but then as if to attenuate  you mean they won't hear of woollett
little bilham smiled
isn't that just what you must see about
it had brought them as she caught the last words into relation with miss barrace whom strether had already observedas he had never before seen a lady at a partymoving about alone
coming within sound of them she had already spoken and she took again through her longhandled glass all her amused and amusing possession
how much poor mr strether you seem to have to see about
but you can't say she gaily declared that i don't do what i can to help you
mr waymarsh is placed
i've left him in the house with miss gostrey
the way little bilham exclaimed mr strether gets the ladies to work for him
he's just preparing to draw in another to pouncedon't you see himon madame de vionnet
madame de vionnet
oh oh oh
miss barrace cried in a wonderful crescendo
there was more in it our friend made out than met the ear
was it after all a joke that he should be serious about anything
he envied miss barrace at any rate her power of not being
she seemed with little cries and protests and quick recognitions movements like the darts of some fine highfeathered freepecking bird to stand before life as before some full shopwindow
you could fairly hear as she selected and pointed the tap of her tortoiseshell against the glass
it's certain that we do need seeing about only i'm glad it's not i who have to do it
one does no doubt begin that way then suddenly one finds that one has given it up
it's too much it's too difficult
you're wonderful you people she continued to strether for not feeling those thingsby which i mean impossibilities
you never feel them
you face them with a fortitude that makes it a lesson to watch you
ah butlittle bilham put it with discouragementwhat do we achieve after all
we see about you and reportwhen we even go so far as reporting
but nothing's done
oh you mr bilham she replied as with an impatient rap on the glass you're not worth sixpence
you come over to convert the savagesfor i know you verily did i remember youand the savages simply convert you
not even
the young man woefully confessed  they haven't gone through that form
they've simplythe cannibalseaten me converted me if you like but converted me into food
i'm but the bleached bones of a christian
well then there we are
onlyand miss barrace appealed again to stretherdon't let it discourage you
you'll break down soon enough but you'll meanwhile have had your moments
il faut en avoir
i always like to see you while you last
and i'll tell you who will last
waymarsh
he had already taken her up
she laughed out as at the alarm of it
he'll resist even miss gostrey  so grand is it not to understand
he's wonderful
he is indeed strether conceded
he wouldn't tell me of this affaironly said he had an engagement but with such a gloom you must let me insist as if it had been an engagement to be hanged
then silently and secretly he turns up here with you
do you call that 'lasting'
oh i hope it's lasting
miss barrace said
but he only at the best bears with me
he doesn't understandnot one little scrap
he's delightful
he's wonderful she repeated
michelangelesque
little bilham completed her meaning
he is a success
moses on the ceiling brought down to the floor overwhelming colossal but somehow portable
certainly if you mean by portable she returned looking so well in one's carriage
he's too funny beside me in his comer he looks like somebody somebody foreign and famous en exil so that people wonderit's very amusingwhom i'm taking about
i show him paris show him everything and he never turns a hair
he's like the indian chief one reads about who when he comes up to washington to see the great father stands wrapt in his blanket and gives no sign
i might be the great fatherfrom the way he takes everything
she was delighted at this hit of her identity with that personageit fitted so her character she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to adopt
and the way he sits too in the corner of my room only looking at my visitors very hard and as if he wanted to start something
they wonder what he does want to start
but he's wonderful miss barrace once more insisted
he has never started anything yet
it presented him none the less in truth to her actual friends who looked at each other in intelligence with frank amusement on bilham's part and a shade of sadness on strether's
strether's sadness sprangfor the image had its grandeurfrom his thinking how little he himself was wrapt in his blanket how little in marble halls all too oblivious of the great father he resembled a really majestic aboriginal
but he had also another reflexion
you've all of you here so much visual sense that you've somehow all 'run' to it
there are moments when it strikes one that you haven't any other
any moral little bilham explained watching serenely across the garden the several femmes du monde
but miss barrace has a moral distinction he kindly continued speaking as if for strether's benefit not less than for her own
have you
strether scarce knowing what he was about asked of her almost eagerly
oh not a distinctionshe was mightily amused at his tonemr bilham's too good
but i think i may say a sufficiency
yes a sufficiency
have you supposed strange things of me
and she fixed him again through all her tortoiseshell with the droll interest of it
you are all indeed wonderful
i should awfully disappoint you
i do take my stand on my sufficiency
but i know i confess she went on strange people
i don't know how it happens i don't do it on purpose it seems to be my doomas if i were always one of their habits  it's wonderful
i dare say moreover she pursued with an interested gravity that i do that we all do here run too much to mere eye
but how can it be helped
we're all looking at each otherand in the light of paris one sees what things resemble
that's what the light of paris seems always to show
it's the fault of the light of parisdear old light
dear old paris
little bilham echoed
everything every one shows miss barrace went on
but for what they really are
strether asked
oh i like your boston 'reallys'
but sometimesyes
dear old paris then
strether resignedly sighed while for a moment they looked at each other
then he broke out  does madame de vionnet do that
i mean really show for what she is
her answer was prompt
she's charming
she's perfect
then why did you a minute ago say 'oh oh oh'
at her name
she easily remembered
why just because
she's wonderful
ah she too
strether had almost a groan
but miss barrace had meanwhile perceived relief
why not put your question straight to the person who can answer it best
no said little bilham don't put any question wait ratherit will be much more funto judge for yourself
he has come to take you to her
ii   on which strether saw that chad was again at hand and he afterwards scarce knew absurd as it may seem what had then quickly occurred
the moment concerned him he felt more deeply than he could have explained and he had a subsequent passage of speculation as to whether on walking off with chad he hadn't looked either pale or red
the only thing he was clear about was that luckily nothing indiscreet had in fact been said and that chad himself was more than ever in miss barrace's great sense wonderful
it was one of the connexionsthough really why it should be after all was none so apparentin which the whole change in him came out as most striking
strether recalled as they approached the house that he had impressed him that first night as knowing how to enter a box
well he impressed him scarce less now as knowing how to make a presentation
it did something for strether's own qualitymarked it as estimated so that our poor friend conscious and passive really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and delivered absolutely as he would have said made a present of given away
as they reached the house a young woman about to come forth appeared unaccompanied on the steps at the exchange with whom of a word on chad's part strether immediately perceived that obligingly kindly she was there to meet them
chad had left her in the house but she had afterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined them in the garden
her air of youth for strether was at first almost disconcerting while his second impression was not less sharply a degree of relief at there not having just been with the others any freedom used about her
it was upon him at a touch that she was no subject for that and meanwhile on chad's introducing him she had spoken to him very simply and gently in an english clearly of the easiest to her yet unlike any other he had ever heard
it wasn't as if she tried nothing he could see after they had been a few minutes together was as if she tried but her speech charming correct and odd was like a precaution against her passing for a pole
there were precautions he seemed indeed to see only when there were really dangers
later on he was to feel many more of them but by that time he was to feel other things besides
she was dressed in black but in black that struck him as light and transparent she was exceedingly fair and though she was as markedly slim her face had a roundness with eyes far apart and a little strange
her smile was natural and dim her hat not extravagant he had only perhaps a sense of the clink beneath her fine black sleeves of more gold bracelets and bangles than he had ever seen a lady wear
chad was excellently free and light about their encounter it was one of the occasions on which strether most wished he himself might have arrived at such ease and such humour  here you are then face to face at last you're made for each othervous allez voir and i bless your union
it was indeed after he had gone off as if he had been partly serious too
this latter motion had been determined by an enquiry from him about jeanne to which her mother had replied that she was probably still in the house with miss gostrey to whom she had lately committed her
ah but you know the young man had rejoined he must see her with which while strether pricked up his ears he had started as if to bring her leaving the other objects of his interest together
strether wondered to find miss gostrey already involved feeling that he missed a link but feeling also with small delay how much he should like to talk with her of madame de vionnet on this basis of evidence
the evidence as yet in truth was meagre which for that matter was perhaps a little why his expectation had had a drop
there was somehow not quite a wealth in her and a wealth was all that in his simplicity he had definitely prefigured
still it was too much to be sure already that there was but a poverty
they moved away from the house and with eyes on a bench at some distance he proposed that they should sit down
i've heard a great deal about you she said as they went but he had an answer to it that made her stop short
well about you madame de vionnet i've heard i'm bound to say almost nothingthose struck him as the only words he himself could utter with any lucidity conscious as he was and as with more reason of the determination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly plain and go perfectly straight
it hadn't at any rate been in the least his idea to spy on chad's proper freedom
it was possibly however at this very instant and under the impression of madame de vionnet's pause that going straight began to announce itself as a matter for care
she had only after all to smile at him ever so gently in order to make him ask himself if he weren't already going crooked
it might be going crooked to find it of a sudden just only clear that she intended very definitely to be what he would have called nice to him
this was what passed between them while for another instant they stood still he couldn't at least remember afterwards what else it might have been
the thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling over him as a wave that he had been in conditions incalculable and unimaginable a subject of discussion
he had been on some ground that concerned her answered for which gave her an advantage he should never be able to match
hasn't miss gostrey she asked said a good word for me
what had struck him first was the way he was bracketed with that lady and he wondered what account chad would have given of their acquaintance
something not as yet traceable at all events had obviously happened
i didn't even know of her knowing you
well now she'll tell you all
i'm so glad you're in relation with her
this was one of the thingsthe all miss gostrey would now tell himthat with every deference to present preoccupation was uppermost for strether after they had taken their seat
one of the others was at the end of five minutes that sheoh incontestably yesdiffered less differed that is scarcely at allwell superficially speaking from mrs newsome or even from mrs pocock
she was ever so much younger than the one and not so young as the other but what was there in her if anything that would have made it impossible he should meet her at woollett
and wherein was her talk during their moments on the bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a woollett gardenpartyunless perhaps truly in not being quite so bright
she observed to him that mr newsome had to her knowledge taken extraordinary pleasure in his visit but there was no good lady at woollett who wouldn't have been at least up to that
was there in chad by chance after all deep down a principle of aboriginal loyalty that had made him for sentimental ends attach himself to elements happily encountered that would remind him most of the old air and the old soil
why accordingly be in a flutterstrether could even put it that wayabout this unfamiliar phenomenon of the femme du monde
on these terms mrs newsome herself was as much of one
little bilham verily had testified that they came out the ladies of the type in close quarters but it was just in these quartersnow comparatively closethat he felt madame de vionnet's common humanity
she did come out and certainly to his relief but she came out as the usual thing
there might be motives behind but so could there often be even at woollett
the only thing was that if she showed him she wished to like himas the motives behind might conceivably promptit would possibly have been more thrilling for him that she should have shown as more vividly alien
ah she was neither turk nor polewhich would be indeed flat once more for mrs newsome and mrs pocock
a lady and two gentlemen had meanwhile however approached their bench and this accident stayed for the time further developments
they presently addressed his companion the brilliant strangers she rose to speak to them and strether noted how the escorted lady though mature and by no means beautiful had more of the bold high look the range of expensive reference that he had as might have been said made his plans for
madame de vionnet greeted her as duchesse and was greeted in turn while talk started in french as ma toutebelle little facts that had their due their vivid interest for strether
madame de vionnet didn't none the less introduce hima note he was conscious of as false to the woollett scale and the woollett humanity though it didn't prevent the duchess who struck him as confident and free very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses from looking at him as straight and as hardfor it was hardas if she would have liked all the same to know him
oh yes my dear it's all right it's me and who are you with your interesting wrinkles and your most effective is it the handsomest is it the ugliest
of noses
some such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed fragrantly enough to fling at him
strether almost wonderedat such a pace was he goingif some divination of the influence of either party were what determined madame de vionnet's abstention
one of the gentlemen in any case succeeded in placing himself in close relation with our friend's companion a gentleman rather stout and importantly short in a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat buttoned with an effect of superlative decision
his french had quickly turned to equal english and it occurred to strether that he might well be one of the ambassadors
his design was evidently to assert a claim to madame de vionnet's undivided countenance and he made it good in the course of a minuteled her away with a trick of three words a trick played with a social art of which strether looking after them as the four whose backs were now all turned moved off felt himself no master
he sank again upon his bench and while his eyes followed the party reflected as he had done before on chad's strange communities
he sat there alone for five minutes with plenty to think of above all with his sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman overlaid now by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and indifferent
he hadn't yet had so quiet a surrender he didn't in the least care if nobody spoke to him more
he might have been by his attitude in for something of a march so broad that the want of ceremony with which he had just been used could fall into its place as but a minor incident of the procession
besides there would be incidents enough as he felt when this term of contemplation was closed by the reappearance of little bilham who stood before him a moment with a suggestive well
in which he saw himself reflected as disorganised as possibly floored
he replied with a well
intended to show that he wasn't floored in the least
no indeed he gave it out as the young man sat down beside him that if at the worst he had been overturned at all he had been overturned into the upper air the sublimer element with which he had an affinity and in which he might be trusted a while to float
it wasn't a descent to earth to say after an instant and in sustained response to the reference you're quite sure her husband's living
oh dear yes
ah then
ah then what
strether had after all to think
well i'm sorry for them
but it didn't for the moment matter more than that
he assured his young friend he was quite content
they wouldn't stir were all right as they were
he didn't want to be introduced had been introduced already about as far as he could go
he had seen moreover an immensity liked gloriani who as miss barrace kept saying was wonderful had made out he was sure the halfdozen other 'men who were distinguished the artists the critics and oh the great dramatisthim it was easy to spot but wantedno thanks reallyto talk with none of them having nothing at all to say and finding it would do beautifully as it was do beautifully because what it waswell was just simply too late
and when after this little bilham submissive and responsive but with an eye to the consolation nearest easily threw off some better late than never
all he got in return for it was a sharp better early than late
this note indeed the next thing overflowed for strether into a quiet stream of demonstration that as soon as he had let himself go he felt as the real relief
it had consciously gathered to a head but the reservoir had filled sooner than he knew and his companion's touch was to make the waters spread
there were some things that had to come in time if they were to come at all
if they didn't come in time they were lost for ever
it was the general sense of them that had overwhelmed him with its long slow rush
it's not too late for you on any side and you don't strike me as in danger of missing the train besides which people can be in general pretty well trusted of coursewith the clock of their freedom ticking as loud as it seems to do hereto keep an eye on the fleeting hour
all the same don't forget that you're youngblessedly young be glad of it on the contrary and live up to it
live all you can it's a mistake not to
it doesn't so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life
if you haven't had that what have you had
this place and these impressionsmild as you may find them to wind a man up so all my impressions of chad and of people i've seen at his placewell have had their abundant message for me have just dropped that into my mind
i see it now
i haven't done so enough beforeand now i'm old too old at any rate for what i see
oh i do see at least and more than you'd believe or i can express
it's too late
and it's as if the train had fairly waited at the station for me without my having had the gumption to know it was there
now i hear its faint receding whistle miles and miles down the line
what one loses one loses make no mistake about that
the affairi mean the affair of lifecouldn't no doubt have been different for me for it's at the best a tin mould either fluted and embossed with ornamental excrescences or else smooth and dreadfully plain into which a helpless jelly one's consciousness is pouredso that one 'takes' the form as the great cook says and is more or less compactly held by it one lives in fine as one can
still one has the illusion of freedom therefore don't be like me without the memory of that illusion
i was either at the right time too stupid or too intelligent to have it i don't quite know which
of course at present i'm a case of reaction against the mistake and the voice of reaction should no doubt always be taken with an allowance
but that doesn't affect the point that the right time is now yours
the right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have
you've plenty that's the great thing you're as i say damn you so happily and hatefully young
don't at any rate miss things out of stupidity
of course i don't take you for a fool or i shouldn't be addressing you thus awfully
do what you like so long as you don't make my mistake
for it was a mistake
live

slowly and sociably with full pauses and straight dashes strether had so delivered himself holding little bilham from step to step deeply and gravely attentive
the end of all was that the young man had turned quite solemn and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety the speaker had wished to promote
he watched for a moment the consequence of his words and then laying a hand on his listener's knee and as if to end with the proper joke  and now for the eye i shall keep on you
oh but i don't know that i want to be at your age too different from you
ah prepare while you're about it said strether to be more amusing
little bilham continued to think but at last had a smile
well you are amusingto me
impayable as you say no doubt
but what am i to myself
strether had risen with this giving his attention now to an encounter that in the middle of the garden was in the act of taking place between their host and the lady at whose side madame de vionnet had quitted him
this lady who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends awaited gloriani's eager approach with words on her lips that strether couldn't catch but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give him the echo
he was sure she was prompt and fine but also that she had met her match and he likedin the light of what he was quite sure was the duchess's latent insolencethe good humour with which the great artist asserted equal resources
were they this pair of the great worldand was he himself for the moment and thus related to them by his observation in it
then there was something in the great world covertly tigerish which came to him across the lawn and in the charming air as a waft from the jungle
yet it made him admire most of the two made him envy the glossy male tiger magnificently marked
these absurdities of the stirred sense fruits of suggestion ripening on the instant were all reflected in his next words to little bilham
i knowif we talk of thatwhom i should enjoy being like
little bilham followed his eyes but then as with a shade of knowing surprise  gloriani
our friend had in fact already hesitated though not on the hint of his companion's doubt in which there were depths of critical reserve
he had just made out in the now full picture something and somebody else another impression had been superimposed
a young girl in a white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view and what was presently clear was that her course was toward them
what was clearer still was that the handsome young man at her side was chad newsome and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore mademoiselle de vionnet that she was unmistakeably prettybright gentle shy happy wonderfuland that chad now with a consummate calculation of effect was about to present her to his old friend's vision
what was clearest of all indeed was something much more than this something at the single stroke of whichand wasn't it simply juxtapositionall vagueness vanished
it was the click of a springhe saw the truth
he had by this time also met chad's look there was more of it in that and the truth accordingly so far as bilham's enquiry was concerned had thrust in the answer
oh chad
it was that rare youth he should have enjoyed being like
the virtuous attachment would be all there before him the virtuous attachment would be in the very act of appeal for his blessing jeanne de vionnet this charming creature would be exquisitely intensely nowthe object of it
chad brought her straight up to him and chad was oh yes at this momentfor the glory of woollett or whateverbetter still even than gloriani
he had plucked this blossom he had kept it overnight in water and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect
that was why strether had felt at first the breath of calculationand why moreover as he now knew his look at the girl would be for the young man a sign of the latter's success
what young man had ever paraded about that way without a reason a maiden in her flower
and there was nothing in his reason at present obscure
her type sufficiently told of itthey wouldn't they couldn't want her to go to woollett
poor woollett and what it might missthough brave chad indeed too and what it might gain
brave chad however had just excellently spoken
this is a good little friend of mine who knows all about you and has moreover a message for you
and this my dearhe had turned to the child herselfis the best man in the world who has it in his power to do a great deal for us and whom i want you to like and revere as nearly as possible as much as i do
she stood there quite pink a little frightened prettier and prettier and not a bit like her mother
there was in this last particular no resemblance but that of youth to youth and here was in fact suddenly strether's sharpest impression
it went wondering dazed embarrassed back to the woman he had just been talking with it was a revelation in the light of which he already saw she would become more interesting
so slim and fresh and fair she had yet put forth this perfection so that for really believing it of her for seeing her to any such developed degree as a mother comparison would be urgent
well what was it now but fairly thrust upon him
mamma wishes me to tell you before we go the girl said that she hopes very much you'll come to see us very soon
she has something important to say to you
she quite reproaches herself chad helpfully explained  you were interesting her so much when she accidentally suffered you to be interrupted
ah don't mention it
strether murmured looking kindly from one to the other and wondering at many things
and i'm to ask you for myself jeanne continued with her hands clasped together as if in some small learnt prayeri'm to ask you for myself if you won't positively come
leave it to me deari'll take care of it
chad genially declared in answer to this while strether himself almost held his breath
what was in the girl was indeed too soft too unknown for direct dealing so that one could only gaze at it as at a picture quite staying one's own hand
but with chad he was now on groundchad he could meet so pleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man freely exhale
there was the whole of a story in his tone to his companion and he spoke indeed as if already of the family
it made strether guess the more quickly what it might be about which madame de vionnet was so urgent
having seen him then she had found him easy she wished to have it out with him that some way for the young people must be discovered some way that would not impose as a condition the transplantation of her daughter
he already saw himself discussing with this lady the attractions of woollett as a residence for chad's companion
was that youth going now to trust her with the affairso that it would be after all with one of his ladyfriends that his mother's missionary should be condemned to deal
it was quite as if for an instant the two men looked at each other on this question
but there was no mistaking at last chad's pride in the display of such a connexion
this was what had made him so carry himself while three minutes before he was bringing it into view what had caused his friend first catching sight of him to be so struck with his air
it was in a word just when he thus finally felt chad putting things straight off on him that he envied him as he had mentioned to little bilham most
the whole exhibition however was but a matter of three or four minutes and the author of it had soon explained that as madame de vionnet was immediately going on this could be for jeanne but a snatch
they would all meet again soon and strether was meanwhile to stay and amuse himselfi'll pick you up again in plenty of time
he took the girl off as he had brought her and strether with the faint sweet foreignness of her au revoir monsieur
in his ears as a note almost unprecedented watched them recede side by side and felt how once more her companion's relation to her got an accent from it
they disappeared among the others and apparently into the house whereupon our friend turned round to give out to little bilham the conviction of which he was full
but there was no little bilham any more little bilham had within the few moments for reasons of his own proceeded further  a circumstance by which in its order strether was also sensibly affected
iii   chad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his promise of coming back but miss gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation of his failure
there had been reasons at the last for his going off with ces dames and he had asked her with much instance to come out and take charge of their friend
she did so strether felt as she took her place beside him in a manner that left nothing to desire
he had dropped back on his bench alone again for a time and the more conscious for little bilham's defection of his unexpressed thought in respect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious vessel
it's the child
he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she appeared and though her direct response was for some time delayed he could feel in her meanwhile the working of this truth
it might have been simply as she waited that they were now in presence altogether of truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered her in the mere cupful inasmuch as who should ces dames prove to be but persons about whomonce thus face to face with themshe found she might from the first have told him almost everything
this would have freely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their name
there could be no better exampleand she appeared to note it with high amusementthan the way making things out already so much for himself he was at last throwing precautions to the winds
they were neither more nor less she and the child's mother than old schoolfriendsfriends who had scarcely met for years but whom this unlookedfor chance had brought together with a rush
it was a relief miss gostrey hinted to feel herself no longer groping she was unaccustomed to grope and as a general thing he might well have seen made straight enough for her clue
with the one she had now picked up in her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder
she's coming to see methat's for you strether's counsellor continued but i don't require it to know where i am
the waste of wonder might be proscribed but strether characteristically was even by this time in the immensity of space
by which you mean that you know where she is
she just hesitated
i mean that if she comes to see me i shallnow that i've pulled myself round a bit after the shocknot be at home
strether hung poised
you call ityour recognitiona shock
she gave one of her rare flickers of impatience
it was a surprise an emotion
don't be so literal
i wash my hands of her
poor strether's face lengthened
she's impossible
she's even more charming than i remembered her
then what's the matter
she had to think how to put it
well i'm impossible
it's impossible
everything's impossible
he looked at her an instant
i see where you're coming out
everything's possible
their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of some duration after which he pursued  isn't it that beautiful child
then as she still said nothing  why don't you mean to receive her
her answer in an instant rang clear
because i wish to keep out of the business
it provoked in him a weak wail
you're going to abandon me now
no i'm only going to abandon her
she'll want me to help her with you
and i won't
you'll only help me with her
well then
most of the persons previously gathered had in the interest of tea passed into the house and they had the gardens mainly to themselves
the shadows were long the last call of the birds who had made a home of their own in the noble interspaced quarter sounded from the high trees in the other gardens as well those of the old convent and of the old hotels it was as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out
strether's impressions were still present it was as if something had happened that nailed them made them more intense but he was to ask himself soon afterwards that evening what really had happenedconscious as he could after all remain that for a gentleman taken and taken the first time into the great world the world of ambassadors and duchesses the items made a meagre total
it was nothing new to him however as we know that a man might haveat all events such a man as hean amount of experience out of any proportion to his adventures so that though it was doubtless no great adventure to sit on there with miss gostrey and hear about madame de vionnet the hour the picture the immediate the recent the possibleas well as the communication itself not a note of which failed to reverberateonly gave the moments more of the taste of history
it was history to begin with that jeanne's mother had been threeandtwenty years before at geneva schoolmate and good girlfriend to maria gostrey who had moreover enjoyed since then though interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop other glimpses of her
twentythree years put them both on no doubt and madame de vionnetthough she had married straight after schoolcouldn't be today an hour less than thirtyeight
this made her ten years older than chadthough ten years also if strether liked older than she looked the least at any rate that a prospective motherinlaw could be expected to do with
she would be of all mothersinlaw the most charming unless indeed through some perversity as yet insupposeable she should utterly belie herself in that relation
there was none surely in which as maria remembered her she mustn't be charming and this frankly in spite of the stigma of failure in the tie where failure always most showed
it was no test therewhen indeed was it a test therefor monsieur de vionnet had been a brute
she had lived for years apart from himwhich was of course always a horrid position but miss gostrey's impression of the matter had been that she could scarce have made a better thing of it had she done it on purpose to show she was amiable
she was so amiable that nobody had had a word to say which was luckily not the case for her husband
he was so impossible that she had the advantage of all her merits
it was still history for strether that the comte de vionnetit being also history that the lady in question was a countessshould now under miss gostrey's sharp touch rise before him as a high distinguished polished impertinent reprobate the product of a mysterious order it was history further that the charming girl so freely sketched by his companion should have been married out of hand by a mother another figure of striking outline full of dark personal motive it was perhaps history most of all that this company was as a matter of course governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the question
ces gensla don't divorce you know any more than they emigrate or abjurethey think it impious and vulgar a fact in the light of which they seemed but the more richly special
it was all special it was all for strether's imagination more or less rich
the girl at the genevese school an isolated interesting attaching creature then both sensitive and violent audacious but always forgiven was the daughter of a french father and an english mother who early left a widow had married againtried afresh with a foreigner in her career with whom she had apparently given her child no example of comfort
all these peoplethe people of the english mother's sidehad been of condition more or less eminent yet with oddities and disparities that had often since made maria thinking them over wonder what they really quite rhymed to
it was in any case her belief that the mother interested and prone to adventure had been without conscience had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of a possible an actual encumbrance
the father by her impression a frenchman with a name one knew had been a different matter leaving his child she clearly recalled a memory all fondness as well as an assured little fortune which was unluckily to make her more or less of a prey later on
she had been in particular at school dazzlingly though quite booklessly clever as polyglot as a little jewess which she wasn't oh no
and chattering french english german italian anything one would in a way that made a clean sweep if not of prizes and parchments at least of every part whether memorised or improvised in the curtained costumed school repertory and in especial of all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference all swagger about home among their variegated mates
it would doubtless be difficult today as between french and english to name her and place her she would certainly show on knowledge miss gostrey felt as one of those convenient types who don't keep you explainingminds with doors as numerous as the manytongued cluster of confessionals at saint peter's
you might confess to her with confidence in roumelian and even roumelian sins
therefore
but strether's narrator covered her implication with a laugh a laugh by which his betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also perhaps sufficiently protected
he had a moment of wondering while his friend went on what sins might be especially roumelian
she went on at all events to the mention of her having met the young thingagain by some swiss lakein her first married state which had appeared for the few intermediate years not at least violently disturbed
she had been lovely at that moment delightful to her full of responsive emotion of amused recognitions and amusing reminders and then once more much later after a long interval equally but differently charmingtouching and rather mystifying for the five minutes of an encounter at a railwaystation en province during which it had come out that her life was all changed
miss gostrey had understood enough to see essentially what had happened and yet had beautifully dreamed that she was herself faultless
there were doubtless depths in her but she was all right strether would see if she wasn't
she was another person howeverthat had been promptly markedfrom the small child of nature at the geneva school a little person quite made over as foreign women were compared with american by marriage
her situation too had evidently cleared itself up there would have beenall that was possiblea judicial separation
she had settled in paris brought up her daughter steered her boat
it was no very pleasant boatespecially thereto be in but marie de vionnet would have headed straight
she would have friends certainlyand very good ones
there she was at all eventsand it was very interesting
her knowing mr chad didn't in the least prove she hadn't friends what it proved was what good ones he had
i saw that said miss gostrey that night at the francais it came out for me in three minutes
i saw heror somebody like her
and so she immediately added did you
oh nonot anybody like her
strether laughed
but you mean he as promptly went on that she has had such an influence on him
miss gostrey was on her feet it was time for them to go
she has brought him up for her daughter
their eyes as so often in candid conference through their settled glasses met over it long after which strether's again took in the whole place
they were quite alone there now
mustn't she ratherin the time thenhave rushed it
ah she won't of course have lost an hour
but that's just the good motherthe good french one
you must remember that of herthat as a mother she's french and that for them there's a special providence
it precisely howeverthat she mayn't have been able to begin as far back as she'd have likedmakes her grateful for aid
strether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way out
she counts on me then to put the thing through
yesshe counts on you
oh and first of all of course miss gostrey added on herwell convincing you
ah her friend returned she caught chad young
yes but there are women who are for all your 'times of life'
they're the most wonderful sort
she had laughed the words out but they brought her companion the next thing to a stand
is what you mean that she'll try to make a fool of me
well i'm wondering what she willwith an opportunitymake
what do you call strether asked an opportunity
my going to see her
ah you must go to see hermiss gostrey was a trifle evasive
you can't not do that
you'd have gone to see the other woman
i mean if there had been onea different sort
it's what you came out for
it might be but strether distinguished
i didn't come out to see this sort
she had a wonderful look at him now
are you disappointed she isn't worse
he for a moment entertained the question then found for it the frankest of answers
yes
if she were worse she'd be better for our purpose
it would be simpler
perhaps she admitted
but won't this be pleasanter
ah you know he promptly replied i didn't come outwasn't that just what you originally reproached me withfor the pleasant
precisely
therefore i say again what i said at first
you must take things as they come
besides miss gostrey added i'm not afraid for myself
for yourself
of your seeing her
i trust her
there's nothing she'll say about me
in fact there's nothing she can
strether wonderedlittle as he had thought of this
then he broke out
oh you women
there was something in it at which she flushed
yesthere we are
we're abysses
at last she smiled
but i risk her
he gave himself a shake
well then so do i
but he added as they passed into the house that he would see chad the first thing in the morning
this was the next day the more easily effected that the young man as it happened even before he was down turned up at his hotel
strether took his coffee by habit in the public room but on his descending for this purpose chad instantly proposed an adjournment to what he called greater privacy
he had himself as yet had nothingthey would sit down somewhere together and when after a few steps and a turn into the boulevard they had for their greater privacy sat down among twenty others our friend saw in his companion's move a fear of the advent of waymarsh
it was the first time chad had to that extent given this personage away and strether found himself wondering of what it was symptomatic
he made out in a moment that the youth was in earnest as he hadn't yet seen him which in its turn threw a ray perhaps a trifle startling on what they had each up to that time been treating as earnestness
it was sufficiently flattering however that the real thingif this was at last the real thingshould have been determined as appeared precisely by an accretion of strether's importance
for this was what it quickly enough came tothat chad rising with the lark had rushed down to let him know while his morning consciousness was yet young that he had literally made the afternoon before a tremendous impression
madame de vionnet wouldn't couldn't rest till she should have some assurance from him that he would consent again to see her
the announcement was made across their marbletopped table while the foam of the hot milk was in their cups and its plash still in the air with the smile of chad's easiest urbanity and this expression of his face caused our friend's doubts to gather on the spot into a challenge of the lips
see herethat was all he only for the moment said again see here
chad met it with all his air of straight intelligence while strether remembered again that fancy of the first impression of him the happy young pagan handsome and hard but oddly indulgent whose mysterious measure he had under the streetlamp tried mentally to take
the young pagan while a long look passed between them sufficiently understood
strether scarce needed at last to say the resti want to know where i am
but he said it adding before any answer something more
are you engaged to be marriedis that your secretto the young lady
chad shook his head with the slow amenity that was one of his ways of conveying that there was time for everything
i have no secretthough i may have secrets
i haven't at any rate that one
we're not engaged
no
then where's the hitch
do you mean why i haven't already started with you
chad beginning his coffee and buttering his roll was quite ready to explain
nothing would have induced menothing will still induce menot to try to keep you here as long as you can be made to stay
it's too visibly good for you
strether had himself plenty to say about this but it was amusing also to measure the march of chad's tone
he had never been more a man of the world and it was always in his company present to our friend that one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world acquitted himself
chad kept it up beautifully
my ideavoyonsis simply that you should let madame de vionnet know you simply that you should consent to know her
i don't in the least mind telling you that clever and charming as she is she's ever so much in my confidence
all i ask of you is to let her talk to you
you've asked me about what you call my hitch and so far as it goes she'll explain it to you
she's herself my hitch hang itif you must really have it all out
but in a sense he hastened in the most wonderful manner to add that you'll quite make out for yourself
she's too good a friend confound her
too good i mean for me to leave withoutwithout it was his first hesitation
without what
well without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my sacrifice
it will be a sacrifice then
it will be the greatest loss i ever suffered
i owe her so much
it was beautiful the way chad said these things and his plea was now confessedlyoh quite flagrantly and publiclyinteresting
the moment really took on for strether an intensity
chad owed madame de vionnet so much
what did that do then but clear up the whole mystery
he was indebted for alterations and she was thereby in a position to have sent in her bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction
what was this at bottom but what had been to be arrived at
strether sat there arriving at it while he munched toast and stirred his second cup
to do this with the aid of chad's pleasant earnest face was also to do more besides
no never before had he been so ready to take him as he was
what was it that had suddenly so cleared up
it was just everybody's character that is everybody's butin a measurehis own
strether felt his character receive for the instant a smutch from all the wrong things he had suspected or believed
the person to whom chad owed it that he could positively turn out such a comfort to other personssuch a person was sufficiently raised above any breath by the nature of her work and the young man's steady light
all of which was vivid enough to come and go quickly though indeed in the midst of it strether could utter a question
have i your word of honour that if i surrender myself to madame de vionnet you'll surrender yourself to me
chad laid his hand firmly on his friend's
my dear man you have it
there was finally something in his felicity almost embarrassing and oppressivestrether had begun to fidget under it for the open air and the erect posture
he had signed to the waiter that he wished to pay and this transaction took some moments during which he thoroughly felt while he put down money and pretendedit was quite hollowto estimate change that chad's higher spirit his youth his practice his paganism his felicity his assurance his impudence whatever it might be had consciously scored a success
well that was all right so far as it went his sense of the thing in question covered our friend for a minute like a veil through whichas if he had been muffledhe heard his interlocutor ask him if he mightn't take him over about five
over was over the river and over the river was where madame de vionnet lived and five was that very afternoon
they got at last out of the placegot out before he answered
he lighted in the street a cigarette which again gave him more time
but it was already sharp for him that there was no use in time
what does she propose to do to me
he had presently demanded
chad had no delays
are you afraid of her
oh immensely
don't you see it
well said chad she won't do anything worse to you than make you like her
it's just of that i'm afraid
then it's not fair to me
strether cast about
it's fair to your mother
oh said chad are you afraid of her
scarcely less
or perhaps even more
but is this lady against your interests at home
strether went on
not directly no doubt but she's greatly in favour of them here
and what'here'does she consider them to be
well good relations
with herself
with herself
and what is it that makes them so good
what
well that's exactly what you'll make out if you'll only go as i'm supplicating you to see her
strether stared at him with a little of the wanness no doubt that the vision of more to make out could scarce help producing
i mean how good are they
oh awfully good
again strether had faltered but it was brief
it was all very well but there was nothing now he wouldn't risk
excuse me but i must reallyas i began by telling youknow where i am
is she bad
'bad'
chad echoed it but without a shock
is that what's implied
when relations are good
strether felt a little silly and was even conscious of a foolish laugh at having it imposed on him to have appeared to speak so
what indeed was he talking about
his stare had relaxed he looked now all round him
but something in him brought him back though he still didn't know quite how to turn it
the two or three ways he thought of and one of them in particular were even with scruples dismissed too ugly
he none the less at last found something
is her life without reproach
it struck him directly he had found it as pompous and priggish so much so that he was thankful to chad for taking it only in the right spirit
the young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect was practically of positive blandness
absolutely without reproach
a beautiful life
allez donc voir
these last words were in the liberality of their confidence so imperative that strether went through no form of assent but before they separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a quarter to five
book sixth     i   it was quite by halfpast fiveafter the two men had been together in madame de vionnet's drawingroom not more than a dozen minutesthat chad with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess said genially gaily  i've an engagement and i know you won't complain if i leave him with you
he'll interest you immensely and as for her he declared to strether i assure you if you're at all nervous she's perfectly safe
he had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee as they could best manage and embarrassment was a thing that strether wasn't at first sure madame de vionnet escaped
he escaped it himself to his surprise but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as brazen
she occupied his hostess in the rue de bellechasse the first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old clean court
the court was large and open full of revelations for our friend of the habit of privacy the peace of intervals the dignity of distances and approaches the house to his restless sense was in the high homely style of an elder day and the ancient paris that he was always looking forsometimes intensely felt sometimes more acutely missedwas in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in the fine boiseries the medallions mouldings mirrors great clear spaces of the greyishwhite salon into which he had been shown
he seemed at the very outset to see her in the midst of possessions not vulgarly numerous but hereditary cherished charming
while his eyes turned after a little from those of his hostess and chad freely talkednot in the least about him but about other people people he didn't know and quite as if he did know themhe found himself making out as a background of the occupant some glory some prosperity of the first empire some napoleonic glamour some dim lustre of the great legend elements clinging still to all the consular chairs and mythological brasses and sphinxes' heads and faded surfaces of satin striped with alternate silk
the place itself went further backthat he guessed and how old paris continued in a manner to echo there but the postrevolutionary period the world he vaguely thought of as the world of chateaubriand of madame de stael even of the young lamartine had left its stamp of harps and urns and torches a stamp impressed on sundry small objects ornaments and relics
he had never before to his knowledge had present to him relics of any special dignity of a private orderlittle old miniatures medallions pictures books books in leather bindings pinkish and greenish with gilt garlands on the back ranged together with other promiscuous properties under the glass of brassmounted cabinets
his attention took them all tenderly into account
they were among the matters that marked madame de vionnet's apartment as something quite different from miss gostrey's little museum of bargains and from chad's lovely home he recognised it as founded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to time shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of curiosity
chad and miss gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked up and exchanged sifting selecting comparing whereas the mistress of the scene before him beautifully passive under the spell of transmissiontransmission from her father's line he quite made up his mindhad only received accepted and been quiet
when she hadn't been quiet she had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some fallen fortune
there had been objects she or her predecessors might even conceivably have parted with under need but strether couldn't suspect them of having sold old pieces to get better ones
they would have felt no difference as to better or worse
he could but imagine their having feltperhaps in emigration in proscription for his sketch was slight and confusedthe pressure of want or the obligation of sacrifice
the pressure of wantwhatever might be the case with the other forcewas however presumably not active now for the tokens of a chastened ease still abounded after all many marks of a taste whose discriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric
he guessed at intense little preferences and sharp little exclusions a deep suspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right
the general result of this was something for which he had no name on the spot quite ready but something he would have come nearest to naming in speaking of it as the air of supreme respectability the consciousness small still reserved but none the less distinct and diffused of private honour
the air of supreme respectabilitythat was a strange blank wall for his adventure to have brought him to break his nose against
it had in fact as he was now aware filled all the approaches hovered in the court as he passed hung on the staircase as he mounted sounded in the grave rumble of the old bell as little electric as possible of which chad at the door had pulled the ancient but neatlykept tassel it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had ever breathed
he would have answered for it at the end of a quarter of an hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and epaulettes of ancient colonels and generals medals and orders once pinned over hearts that had long since ceased to beat snuffboxes bestowed on ministers and envoys copies of works presented with inscriptions by authors now classic
at bottom of it all for him was the sense of her rare unlikeness to the women he had known
this sense had grown since the day before the more he recalled her and had been above all singularly fed by his talk with chad in the morning
everything in fine made her immeasurably new and nothing so new as the old house and the old objects
there were books two or three on a small table near his chair but they hadn't the lemoncoloured covers with which his eye had begun to dally from the hour of his arrival and to the opportunity of a further acquaintance with which he had for a fortnight now altogether succumbed
on another table across the room he made out the great revue but even that familiar face conspicuous in mrs newsome's parlours scarce counted here as a modern note
he was sure on the spotand he afterwards knew he was rightthat this was a touch of chad's own hand
what would mrs newsome say to the circumstance that chad's interested influence kept her paperknife in the revue
the interested influence at any rate had as we say gone straight to the pointhad in fact soon left it quite behind
she was seated near the fire on a small stuffed and fringed chair one of the few modern articles in the room and she leaned back in it with her hands clasped in her lap and no movement in all her person but the fine prompt play of her deep young face
the fire under the low white marble undraped and academic had burnt down to the silver ashes of light wood one of the windows at a distance stood open to the mildness and stillness out of which in the short pauses came the faint sound pleasant and homely almost rustic of a plash and a clatter of sabots from some coachhouse on the other side of the court
madame de vionnet while strether sat there wasn't to shift her posture by an inch
i don't think you seriously believe in what you're doing she said but all the same you know i'm going to treat you quite as if i did
by which you mean strether directly replied quite as if you didn't
i assure you it won't make the least difference with me how you treat me
well she said taking that menace bravely and philosophically enough the only thing that really matters is that you shall get on with me
ah but i don't
he immediately returned
it gave her another pause which however she happily enough shook off
will you consent to go on with me a littleprovisionallyas if you did
then it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way and there accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from somewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes
he might have been perched at his doorstep or at his window and she standing in the road
for a moment he let her stand and couldn't moreover have spoken
it had been sad of a sudden with a sadness that was like a cold breath in his face
what can i do he finally asked but listen to you as i promised chadwick
ah but what i'm asking you she quickly said isn't what mr newsome had in mind
she spoke at present he saw as if to take courageously all her risk
this is my own idea and a different thing
it gave poor strether in truthuneasy as it made him toosomething of the thrill of a bold perception justified
well he answered kindly enough i was sure a moment since that some idea of your own had come to you
she seemed still to look up at him but now more serenely
i made out you were sureand that helped it to come
so you see she continued we do get on
oh but it appears to me i don't at all meet your request
how can i when i don't understand it
it isn't at all necessary you should understand it will do quite well enough if you simply remember it
only feel i trust youand for nothing so tremendous after all
just she said with a wonderful smile for common civility
strether had a long pause while they sat again face to face as they had sat scarce less conscious before the poor lady had crossed the stream
she was the poor lady for strether now because clearly she had some trouble and her appeal to him could only mean that her trouble was deep
he couldn't help it it wasn't his fault he had done nothing but by a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter a relation
and the relation profited by a mass of things that were not strictly in it or of it by the very air in which they sat by the high cold delicate room by the world outside and the little plash in the court by the first empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets by matters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp of her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural when her eyes were most fixed
you count upon me of course for something really much greater than it sounds
oh it sounds great enough too
she laughed at this
he found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was as miss barrace called it wonderful but catching himself up he said something else instead
what was it chad's idea then that you should say to me
ah his idea was simply what a man's idea always isto put every effort off on the woman
the 'woman'
strether slowly echoed
the woman he likesand just in proportion as he likes her
in proportion toofor shifting the troubleas she likes him
strether followed it then with an abruptness of his own how much do you like chad
just as much as thatto take all with you on myself
but she got at once again away from this
i've been trembling as if we were to stand or fall by what you may think of me and i'm even now she went on wonderfully drawing a long breathand yes truly taking a great couragefrom the hope that i don't in fact strike you as impossible
that's at all events clearly he observed after an instant the way i don't strike you
well she so far assented as you haven't yet said you won't have the little patience with me i ask for  you draw splendid conclusions
perfectly
but i don't understand them strether pursued
you seem to me to ask for much more than you need
what at the worst for you what at the best for myself can i after all do
i can use no pressure that i haven't used
you come really late with your request
i've already done all that for myself the case admits of
i've said my say and here i am
yes here you are fortunately
madame de vionnet laughed
mrs newsome she added in another tone didn't think you can do so little
he had an hesitation but he brought the words out
well she thinks so now
do you mean by that
but she also hung fire
do i mean what
she still rather faltered
pardon me if i touch on it but if i'm saying extraordinary things why perhaps mayn't i
besides doesn't it properly concern us to know
to know what
he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she had again dropped
she made the effort
has she given you up
he was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it
not yet
it was almost as if he were a trifle disappointedhad expected still more of her freedom
but he went straight on
is that what chad has told you will happen to me
she was evidently charmed with the way he took it
if you mean if we've talked of itmost certainly
and the question's not what has had least to do with my wishing to see you
to judge if i'm the sort of man a woman can
precisely she exclaimedyou wonderful gentleman
i do judgei have judged
a woman can't
you're safewith every right to be
you'd be much happier if you'd only believe it
strether was silent a little then he found himself speaking with a cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were strange to him
i try to believe it
but it's a marvel he exclaimed how you already get at it
oh she was able to say
remember how much i was on the way to it through mr newsomebefore i saw you
he thinks everything of your strength
well i can bear almost anything
our friend briskly interrupted
deep and beautiful on this her smile came back and with the effect of making him hear what he had said just as she had heard it
he easily enough felt that it gave him away but what in truth had everything done but that
it had been all very well to think at moments that he was holding her nose down and that he had coerced her  what had he by this time done but let her practically see that he accepted their relation
what was their relation moreoverthough light and brief enough in form as yetbut whatever she might choose to make it
nothing could prevent hercertainly he couldn'tfrom making it pleasant
at the back of his head behind everything was the sense that she wasthere before him close to him in vivid imperative formone of the rare women he had so often heard of read of thought of but never met whose very presence look voice the mere contemporaneous fact of whom from the moment it was at all presented made a relation of mere recognition
that was not the kind of woman he had ever found mrs newsome a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to establish herself and at present confronted with madame de vionnet he felt the simplicity of his original impression of miss gostrey
she certainly had been a fact of rapid growth but the world was wide each day was more and more a new lesson
there were at any rate even among the stranger ones relations and relations
of course i suit chad's grand way he quickly added
he hasn't had much difficulty in working me in
she seemed to deny a little on the young man's behalf by the rise of her eyebrows an intention of any process at all inconsiderate
you must know how grieved he'd be if you were to lose anything
he believes you can keep his mother patient
strether wondered with his eyes on her
i see
that's then what you really want of me
and how am i to do it
perhaps you'll tell me that
simply tell her the truth
and what do you call the truth
well any truthabout us allthat you see yourself
i leave it to you
thank you very much
i like strether laughed with a slight harshness the way you leave things
but she insisted kindly gently as if it wasn't so bad
be perfectly honest
tell her all
all
he oddly echoed
tell her the simple truth madame de vionnet again pleaded
but what is the simple truth
the simple truth is exactly what i'm trying to discover
she looked about a while but presently she came back to him
tell her fully and clearly about us
strether meanwhile had been staring
you and your daughter
yeslittle jeanne and me
tell her she just slightly quavered you like us
and what good will that do me
or ratherhe caught himself upwhat good will it do you
she looked graver
none you believe really
strether debated
she didn't send me out to 'like' you
oh she charmingly contended she sent you out to face the facts
he admitted after an instant that there was something in that
but how can i face them till i know what they are
do you want him he then braced himself to ask to marry your daughter
she gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt
nonot that
and he really doesn't want to himself
she repeated the movement but now with a strange light in her face
he likes her too much
strether wondered
to be willing to consider you mean the question of taking her to america
to be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and nicereally tender of her
we watch over her and you must help us
you must see her again
strether felt awkward
ah with pleasureshe's so remarkably attractive
the mother's eagerness with which madame de vionnet jumped at this was to come back to him later as beautiful in its grace
the dear thing did please you
then as he met it with the largest oh
of enthusiasm  she's perfect
she's my joy
well i'm sure thatif one were near her and saw more of hershe'd be mine
then said madame de vionnet tell mrs newsome that
he wondered the more
what good will that do you
as she appeared unable at once to say however he brought out something else
is your daughter in love with our friend
ah she rather startlingly answered i wish you'd find out
he showed his surprise
i
a stranger
oh you won't be a strangerpresently
you shall see her quite i assure you as if you weren't
it remained for him none the less an extraordinary notion
it seems to me surely that if her mother can't  ah little girls and their mothers today
she rather inconsequently broke in
but she checked herself with something she seemed to give out as after all more to the point
tell her i've been good for him
don't you think i have
it had its effect on himmore than at the moment he quite measured
yet he was consciously enough touched
oh if it's all you
well it may not be 'all' she interrupted but it's to a great extent
really and truly she added in a tone that was to take its place with him among things remembered
then it's very wonderful
he smiled at her from a face that he felt as strained and her own face for a moment kept him so
at last she also got up
well don't you think that for that  i ought to save you
so it was that the way to meet herand the way as well in a manner to get offcame over him
he heard himself use the exorbitant word the very sound of which helped to determine his flight
i'll save you if i can
ii   in chad's lovely home however one evening ten days later he felt himself present at the collapse of the question of jeanne de vionnet's shy secret
he had been dining there in the company of that young lady and her mother as well as of other persons and he had gone into the petit salon at chad's request on purpose to talk with her
the young man had put this to him as a favouri should like so awfully to know what you think of her
it will really be a chance for you he had said to see the jeune fillei mean the typeas she actually is and i don't think that as an observer of manners it's a thing you ought to miss
it will be an impression thatwhatever else you takeyou can carry home with you where you'll find again so much to compare it with
strether knew well enough with what chad wished him to compare it and though he entirely assented he hadn't yet somehow been so deeply reminded that he was being as he constantly though mutely expressed it used
he was as far as ever from making out exactly to what end but he was none the less constantly accompanied by a sense of the service he rendered
he conceived only that this service was highly agreeable to those who profited by it and he was indeed still waiting for the moment at which he should catch it in the act of proving disagreeable proving in some degree intolerable to himself
he failed quite to see how his situation could clear up at all logically except by some turn of events that would give him the pretext of disgust
he was building from day to day on the possibility of disgust but each day brought forth meanwhile a new and more engaging bend of the road
that possibility was now ever so much further from sight than on the eve of his arrival and he perfectly felt that should it come at all it would have to be at best inconsequent and violent
he struck himself as a little nearer to it only when he asked himself what service in such a life of utility he was after all rendering mrs newsome
when he wished to help himself to believe that he was still all right he reflectedand in fact with wonderon the unimpaired frequency of their correspondence in relation to which what was after all more natural than that it should become more frequent just in proportion as their problem became more complicated
certain it is at any rate that he now often brought himself balm by the question with the rich consciousness of yesterday's letter well what can i do more than thatwhat can i do more than tell her everything
to persuade himself that he did tell her had told her everything he used to try to think of particular things he hadn't told her
when at rare moments and in the watches of the night he pounced on one it generally showed itself to beto a deeper scrutinynot quite truly of the essence
when anything new struck him as coming up or anything already noted as reappearing he always immediately wrote as if for fear that if he didn't he would miss something and also that he might be able to say to himself from time to time she knows it noweven while i worry
it was a great comfort to him in general not to have left past things to be dragged to light and explained not to have to produce at so late a stage anything not produced or anything even veiled and attenuated at the moment
she knew it now  that was what he said to himself tonight in relation to the fresh fact of chad's acquaintance with the two ladiesnot to speak of the fresher one of his own
mrs newsome knew in other words that very night at woollett that he himself knew madame de vionnet and that he had conscientiously been to see her also that he had found her remarkably attractive and that there would probably be a good deal more to tell
but she further knew or would know very soon that again conscientiously he hadn't repeated his visit and that when chad had asked him on the countess's behalfstrether made her out vividly with a thought at the back of his head a countessif he wouldn't name a day for dining with her he had replied lucidly thank you very muchimpossible
he had begged the young man would present his excuses and had trusted him to understand that it couldn't really strike one as quite the straight thing
he hadn't reported to mrs newsome that he had promised to save madame de vionnet but so far as he was concerned with that reminiscence he hadn't at any rate promised to haunt her house
what chad had understood could only in truth be inferred from chad's behaviour which had been in this connexion as easy as in every other
he was easy always when he understood he was easier still if possible when he didn't he had replied that he would make it all right and he had proceeded to do this by substituting the present occasionas he was ready to substitute othersfor any for every occasion as to which his old friend should have a funny scruple
oh but i'm not a little foreign girl i'm just as english as i can be jeanne de vionnet had said to him as soon as in the petit salon he sank shyly enough on his own side into the place near her vacated by madame gloriani at his approach
madame gloriani who was in black velvet with white lace and powdered hair and whose somewhat massive majesty melted at any contact into the graciousness of some incomprehensible tongue moved away to make room for the vague gentleman after benevolent greetings to him which embodied as he believed in baffling accents some recognition of his face from a couple of sundays before
then he had remarkedmaking the most of the advantage of his yearsthat it frightened him quite enough to find himself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl
there were girls he wasn't afraid ofhe was quite bold with little americans
thus it was that she had defended herself to the endoh but i'm almost american too
that's what mamma has wanted me to bei mean like that for she has wanted me to have lots of freedom
she has known such good results from it
she was fairly beautiful to hima faint pastel in an oval frame he thought of her already as of some lurking image in a long gallery the portrait of a small oldtime princess of whom nothing was known but that she had died young
little jeanne wasn't doubtless to die young but one couldn't all the same bear on her lightly enough
it was bearing hard it was bearing as he in any case wouldn't bear to concern himself in relation to her with the question of a young man
odious really the question of a young man one didn't treat such a person as a maidservant suspected of a follower
and then young men young menwell the thing was their business simply or was at all events hers
she was fluttered fairly feveredto the point of a little glitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots that stayed in her cheekswith the great adventure of dining out and with the greater one still possibly of finding a gentleman whom she must think of as very very old a gentleman with eyeglasses wrinkles a long grizzled moustache
she spoke the prettiest english our friend thought that he had ever heard spoken just as he had believed her a few minutes before to be speaking the prettiest french
he wondered almost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didn't react on the spirit itself and his fancy had in fact before he knew it begun so to stray and embroider that he finally found himself absent and extravagant sitting with the child in a friendly silence
only by this time he felt her flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she was more at her ease
she trusted him liked him and it was to come back to him afterwards that she had told him things
she had dipped into the waiting medium at last and found neither surge nor chillnothing but the small splash she could herself make in the pleasant warmth nothing but the safety of dipping and dipping again
at the end of the ten minutes he was to spend with her his impressionwith all it had thrown off and all it had taken inwas complete
she had been free as she knew freedom partly to show him that unlike other little persons she knew she had imbibed that ideal
she was delightfully quaint about herself but the vision of what she had imbibed was what most held him
it really consisted he was soon enough to feel in just one great little matter the fact that whatever her nature she was thoroughlyhe had to cast about for the word but it camebred
he couldn't of course on so short an acquaintance speak for her nature but the idea of breeding was what she had meanwhile dropped into his mind
he had never yet known it so sharply presented
her mother gave it no doubt but her mother to make that less sensible gave so much else besides and on neither of the two previous occasions extraordinary woman strether felt anything like what she was giving tonight
little jeanne was a case an exquisite case of education whereas the countess whom it so amused him to think of by that denomination was a case also exquisite ofwell he didn't know what
he has wonderful taste notre jeune homme  this was what gloriani said to him on turning away from the inspection of a small picture suspended near the door of the room
the high celebrity in question had just come in apparently in search of mademoiselle de vionnet but while strether had got up from beside her their fellow guest with his eye sharply caught had paused for a long look
the thing was a landscape of no size but of the french school as our friend was glad to feel he knew and also of a qualitywhich he liked to think he should also have guessed its frame was large out of proportion to the canvas and he had never seen a person look at anything he thought just as gloriani with his nose very near and quick movements of the head from side to side and bottom to top examined this feature of chad's collection
the artist used that word the next moment smiling courteously wiping his nippers and looking round him furtherpaying the place in short by the very manner of his presence and by something strether fancied he could make out in this particular glance such a tribute as to the latter's sense settled many things once for all
strether was conscious at this instant for that matter as he hadn't yet been of how round about him quite without him they were consistently settled
gloriani's smile deeply italian he considered and finely inscrutable had had for him during dinner at which they were not neighbours an indefinite greeting but the quality in it was gone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him inside out it was as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them had snapped
he was conscious now of the final reality which was that there wasn't so much a doubt as a difference altogether all the more that over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost condolingly yet oh how vacantly
as across some great flat sheet of water
he threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which strether wouldn't have trusted his own full weight a moment
that idea even though but transient and perhaps belated had performed the office of putting strether more at his ease and the blurred picture had already droppeddropped with the sound of something else said and with his becoming aware by another quick turn that gloriani was now on the sofa talking with jeanne while he himself had in his ears again the familiar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the oh oh oh
that had made him a fortnight before challenge miss barrace in vain
she had always the air this picturesque and original lady who struck him so oddly as both antique and modernshe had always the air of taking up some joke that one had already had out with her
the point itself no doubt was what was antique and the use she made of it what was modern
he felt just now that her goodnatured irony did bear on something and it troubled him a little that she wouldn't be more explicit only assuring him with the pleasure of observation so visible in her that she wouldn't tell him more for the world
he could take refuge but in asking her what she had done with waymarsh though it must be added that he felt himself a little on the way to a clue after she had answered that this personage was in the other room engaged in conversation with madame de vionnet
he stared a moment at the image of such a conjunction then for miss barrace's benefit he wondered
is she too then under the charm
no not a bitmiss barrace was prompt
she makes nothing of him
she's bored
she won't help you with him
oh strether laughed she can't do everything
of course notwonderful as she is
besides he makes nothing of her
she won't take him from methough she wouldn't no doubt having other affairs in hand even if she could
i've never said miss barrace seen her fail with any one before
and tonight when she's so magnificent it would seem to her strangeif she minded
so at any rate i have him all
je suis tranquille
strether understood so far as that went but he was feeling for his clue
she strikes you tonight as particularly magnificent
surely
almost as i've never seen her
doesn't she you
why it's for you
he persisted in his candour
'for' me
oh oh oh
cried miss barrace who persisted in the opposite of that quality
well he acutely admitted she is different
she's gay
she's gay
miss barrace laughed
and she has beautiful shouldersthough there's nothing different in that
no said strether one was sure of her shoulders
it isn't her shoulders
his companion with renewed mirth and the finest sense  between the puffs of her cigarette of the drollery of things appeared to find their conversation highly delightful
yes it isn't her shoulders 
what then is it
strether earnestly enquired
why it's shesimply
it's her mood
it's her charm
of course it's her charm but we're speaking of the difference
well miss barrace explained she's just brilliant as we used to say
that's all
she's various
she's fifty women
ah but only onestrether kept it clearat a time
perhaps
but in fifty times
oh we shan't come to that our friend declared and the next moment he had moved in another direction
will you answer me a plain question
will she ever divorce
miss barrace looked at him through all her tortoiseshell
why should she
it wasn't what he had asked for he signified but he met it well enough
to marry chad
why should she marry chad
because i'm convinced she's very fond of him
she has done wonders for him
well then how could she do more
marrying a man or woman either miss barrace sagely went on is never the wonder for any jack and jill can bring that off
the wonder is their doing such things without marrying
strether considered a moment this proposition
you mean it's so beautiful for our friends simply to go on so
but whatever he said made her laugh
beautiful
he nevertheless insisted
and that because it's disinterested
she was now however suddenly tired of the question
yes thencall it that
besides she'll never divorce
don't moreover she added believe everything you hear about her husband
he's not then strether asked a wretch
oh yes
but charming
do you know him
i've met him
he's bien aimable
to every one but his wife
oh for all i know to her tooto any to every woman
i hope you at any rate she pursued with a quick change appreciate the care i take of mr
waymarsh
oh immensely
but strether was not yet in line
at all events he roundly brought out the attachment's an innocent one
mine and his
ah she laughed don't rob it of all interest
i mean our friend's hereto the lady we've been speaking of
that was what he had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely involved consequence of his impression of jeanne
that was where he meant to stay
it's innocent he repeatedi see the whole thing
mystified by his abrupt declaration she had glanced over at gloriani as at the unnamed subject of his allusion but the next moment she had understood though indeed not before strether had noticed her momentary mistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too
he already knew that the sculptor admired madame de vionnet but did this admiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was discussable
he was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not of the firmest
he looked hard for an instant at miss barrace but she had already gone on
all right with mr newsome
why of course she is
and she got gaily back to the question of her own good friend
i dare say you're surprised that i'm not worn out with all i seeit being so muchof sitting bull
but i'm not you knowi don't mind him i bear up and we get on beautifully
i'm very strange i'm like that and often i can't explain
there are people who are supposed interesting or remarkable or whatever and who bore me to death and then there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody sees in themin whom i see no end of things
then after she had smoked a moment he's touching you know she said
'know'
strether echoeddon't i indeed
we must move you almost to tears
oh but i don't mean you
she laughed
you ought to then for the worst sign of allas i must have it for youis that you can't help me
that's when a woman pities
ah but i do help you
she cheerfully insisted
again he looked at her hard and then after a pause  no you don't
her tortoiseshell on its long chain rattled down
i help you with sitting bull
that's a good deal
oh that yes
but strether hesitated
do you mean he talks of me
so that i have to defend you
no never'
i see strether mused
it's too deep
that's his only fault she returnedthat everything with him is too deep
he has depths of silencewhich he breaks only at the longest intervals by a remark
and when the remark comes it's always something he has seen or felt for himselfnever a bit banal that would be what one might have feared and what would kill me but never
she smoked again as she thus with amused complacency appreciated her acquisition
and never about you
we keep clear of you
we're wonderful
but i'll tell you what he does do she continued  he tries to make me presents
presents
poor strether echoed conscious with a pang that he hadn't yet tried that in any quarter
why you see she explained he's as fine as ever in the victoria so that when i leave him as i often do almost for hourshe likes it soat the doors of shops the sight of him there helps me when i come out to know my carriage away off in the rank
but sometimes for a change he goes with me into the shops and then i've all i can do to prevent his buying me things
he wants to 'treat' you
strether almost gasped at all he himself hadn't thought of
he had a sense of admiration
oh he's much more in the real tradition than i
yes he mused it's the sacred rage
the sacred rage exactly
and miss barrace who hadn't before heard this term applied recognised its bearing with a clap of her gemmed hands
now i do know why he's not banal
but i do prevent him all the sameand if you saw what he sometimes selectsfrom buying
i save him hundreds and hundreds
i only take flowers
flowers
strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion
how many nosegays had her present converser sent
innocent flowers she pursued as much as he likes
and he sends me splendours he knows all the best placeshe has found them for himself he's wonderful
he hasn't told them to me her friend smiled he has a life of his own
but strether had swung back to the consciousness that for himself after all it never would have done
waymarsh hadn't mrs waymarsh in the least to consider whereas lambert strether had constantly in the inmost honour of his thoughts to consider mrs newsome
he liked moreover to feel how much his friend was in the real tradition
yet he had his conclusion
what a rage it is
he had worked it out
it's an opposition
she followed but at a distance
that's what i feel
yet to what
well he thinks you know that i've a life of my own
and i haven't
you haven't
she showed doubt and her laugh confirmed it
oh oh oh
nonot for myself
i seem to have a life only for other people
ah for them and with them
just now for instance with  well with whom
he asked before she had had time to say
his tone had the effect of making her hesitate and even as he guessed speak with a difference
say with miss gostrey
what do you do for her
it really made him wonder
nothing at all
iii   madame de vionnet having meanwhile come in was at present close to them and miss barrace hereupon instead of risking a rejoinder became again with a look that measured her from top to toe all mere longhandled appreciative tortoiseshell
she had struck our friend from the first of her appearing as dressed for a great occasion and she met still more than on either of the others the conception reawakened in him at their gardenparty the idea of the femme du monde in her habit as she lived
her bare shoulders and arms were white and beautiful the materials of her dress a mixture as he supposed of silk and crape were of a silvery grey so artfully composed as to give an impression of warm splendour and round her neck she wore a collar of large old emeralds the green note of which was more dimly repeated at other points of her apparel in embroidery in enamel in satin in substances and textures vaguely rich
her head extremely fair and exquisitely festal was like a happy fancy a notion of the antique on an old precious medal some silver coin of the renaissance while her slim lightness and brightness her gaiety her expression her decision contributed to an effect that might have been felt by a poet as half mythological and half conventional
he could have compared her to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud or to a seanymph waisthigh in the summer surge
above all she suggested to him the reflexion that the femme du mondein these finest developments of the typewas like cleopatra in the play indeed various and multifold
she had aspects characters days nightsor had them at least showed them by a mysterious law of her own when in addition to everything she happened also to be a woman of genius
she was an obscure person a muffled person one day and a showy person an uncovered person the next
he thought of madame de vionnet tonight as showy and uncovered though he felt the formula rough because thanks to one of the shortcuts of genius she had taken all his categories by surprise
twice during dinner he had met chad's eyes in a longish look but these communications had in truth only stirred up again old ambiguitiesso little was it clear from them whether they were an appeal or an admonition
you see how i'm fixed was what they appeared to convey yet how he was fixed was exactly what strether didn't see
however perhaps he should see now
are you capable of the very great kindness of going to relieve newsome for a few minutes of the rather crushing responsibility of madame gloriani while i say a word if he'll allow me to mr strether of whom i've a question to ask
our host ought to talk a bit to those other ladies and i'll come back in a minute to your rescue
she made this proposal to miss barrace as if her consciousness of a special duty had just flickeredup but that lady's recognition of strether's little start at itas at a betrayal on the speaker's part of a domesticated statewas as mute as his own comment and after an instant when their fellow guest had goodnaturedly left them he had been given something else to think of
why has maria so suddenly gone
do you know
that was the question madame de vionnet had brought with her
i'm afraid i've no reason to give you but the simple reason i've had from her in a notethe sudden obligation to join in the south a sick friend who has got worse
ah then she has been writing you
not since she wenti had only a brief explanatory word before she started
i went to see her strether explainedit was the day after i called on youbut she was already on her way and her concierge told me that in case of my coming i was to be informed she had written to me
i found her note when i got home
madame de vionnet listened with interest and with her eyes on strether's face then her delicately decorated head had a small melancholy motion
she didn't write to me
i went to see her she added almost immediately after i had seen you and as i assured her i would do when i met her at gloriani's
she hadn't then told me she was to be absent and i felt at her door as if i understood
she's absentwith all respect to her sick friend though i know indeed she has plentyso that i may not see her
she doesn't want to meet me again
well she continued with a beautiful conscious mildness i liked and admired her beyond every one in the old time and she knew itperhaps that's precisely what has made her goand i dare say i haven't lost her for ever
strether still said nothing he had a horror as he now thought of himself of being in question between womenwas in fact already quite enough on his way to that and there was moreover as it came to him perceptibly something behind these allusions and professions that should he take it in would square but ill with his present resolve to simplify
it was as if for him all the same her softness and sadness were sincere
he felt that not less when she soon went on i'm extremely glad of her happiness
but it also left him mutesharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed
what it conveyed was that he was maria gostrey's happiness and for the least little instant he had the impulse to challenge the thought
he could have done so however only by saying what then do you suppose to be between us
and he was wonderfully glad a moment later not to have spoken
he would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous and he drew back as well with a smothered inward shudder from the consideration of what womenof highlydeveloped type in particularmight think of each other
whatever he had come out for he hadn't come to go into that so that he absolutely took up nothing his interlocutress had now let drop
yet though he had kept away from her for days had laid wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again she hadn't a gleam of irritation to show him
well about jeanne now
she smiledit had the gaiety with which she had originally come in
he felt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand
but he had been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his little
do you make out that she has a sentiment
i mean for mr
newsome
almost resentful strether could at last be prompt
how can i make out such things
she remained perfectly goodnatured
ah but they're beautiful little things and you make outdon't pretendeverything in the world
haven't you she asked been talking with her
yes but not about chad
at least not much
oh you don't require 'much'
she reassuringly declared
but she immediately changed her ground
i hope you remember your promise of the other day
to 'save' you as you called it
i call it so still
you will
she insisted
you haven't repented
he wondered
nobut i've been thinking what i meant
she kept it up
and not a little what i did
nothat's not necessary
it will be enough if i know what i meant myself
and don't you know she asked by this time
again he had a pause
i think you ought to leave it to me
but how long he added do you give me
it seems to me much more a question of how long you give me
doesn't our friend here himself at any rate she went on perpetually make me present to you
not strether replied by ever speaking of you to me
he never does that
never
she considered and if the fact was disconcerting to her effectually concealed it
the next minute indeed she had recovered
no he wouldn't
but do you need that
her emphasis was wonderful and though his eyes had been wandering he looked at her longer now
i see what you mean
of course you see what i mean
her triumph was gentle and she really had tones to make justice weep
i've before me what he owes you
admit then that that's something she said yet still with the same discretion in her pride
he took in this note but went straight on
you've made of him what i see but what i don't see is how in the world you've done it
ah that's another question
she smiled
the point is of what use is your declining to know me when to know mr newsomeas you do me the honour to find himis just to know me
i see he mused still with his eyes on her
i shouldn't have met you tonight
she raised and dropped her linked hands
it doesn't matter
if i trust you why can't you a little trust me too
and why can't you also she asked in another tone trust yourself
but she gave him no time to reply
oh i shall be so easy for you
and i'm glad at any rate you've seen my child
i'm glad too he said but she does you no good
no good
madame de vionnet had a clear stare
why she's an angel of light
that's precisely the reason
leave her alone
don't try to find out
i mean he explained about what you spoke to me ofthe way she feels
his companion wondered
because one really won't
well because i ask you as a favour to myself not to
she's the most charming creature i've ever seen
therefore don't touch her
don't knowdon't want to know
and moreoveryesyou won't
it was an appeal of a sudden and she took it in
as a favour to you
wellsince you ask me
anything everything you ask she smiled
i shan't know thennever
thank you she added with peculiar gentleness as she turned away
the sound of it lingered with him making him fairly feel as if he had been tripped up and had a fall
in the very act of arranging with her for his independence he had under pressure from a particular perception inconsistently quite stupidly committed himself and with her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage she had driven in by a single word a little golden nail the sharp intention of which he signally felt
he hadn't detached he had more closely connected himself and his eyes as he considered with some intensity this circumstance met another pair which had just come within their range and which struck him as reflecting his sense of what he had done
he recognised them at the same moment as those of little bilham who had apparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him and little bilham wasn't in the conditions the person to whom his heart would be most closed
they were seated together a minute later at the angle of the room obliquely opposite the corner in which gloriani was still engaged with jeanne de vionnet to whom at first and in silence their attention had been benevolently given
i can't see for my life strether had then observed how a young fellow of any spiritsuch a one as you for instancecan be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being hard hit
why don't you go in little bilham
he remembered the tone into which he had been betrayed on the gardenbench at the sculptor's reception and this might make up for that by being much more the right sort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all
there would be some reason
some reason for what
why for hanging on here
to offer my hand and fortune to mademoiselle de vionnet
well strether asked to what lovelier apparition could you offer them
she's the sweetest little thing i've ever seen
she's certainly immense
i mean she's the real thing
i believe the pale pink petals are folded up there for some wondrous efflorescence in time to open that is to some great golden sun
i'm unfortunately but a small farthing candle
what chance in such a field for a poor little painterman
oh you're good enough strether threw out
certainly i'm good enough
we're good enough i consider nous autres for anything
but she's too good
there's the difference
they wouldn't look at me
strether lounging on his divan and still charmed by the young girl whose eyes had consciously strayed to him he fancied with a vague smilestrether enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at last awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him thought over his companion's words
whom do you mean by 'they'
she and her mother
she and her mother
and she has a father too who whatever else he may be certainly can't be indifferent to the possibilities she represents
besides there's chad
strether was silent a little
ah but he doesn't care for hernot i mean it appears after all in the sense i'm speaking of
he's not in love with her
nobut he's her best friend after her mother
he's very fond of her
he has his ideas about what can be done for her
well it's very strange
strether presently remarked with a sighing sense of fulness
very strange indeed
that's just the beauty of it
isn't it very much the kind of beauty you had in mind little bilham went on when you were so wonderful and so inspiring to me the other day
didn't you adjure me in accents i shall never forget to see while i've a chance everything i canand really to see for it must have been that only you meant
well you did me no end of good and i'm doing my best
i do make it out a situation
so do i
strether went on after a moment
but he had the next minute an inconsequent question
how comes chad so mixed up anyway
ah ah ah
and little bilham fell back on his cushions
it reminded our friend of miss barrace and he felt again the brush of his sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions
yet he kept hold of his thread
of course i understand really only the general transformation makes me occasionally gasp
chad with such a voice in the settlement of the future of a little countessno he declared it takes more time
you say moreover he resumed that we're inevitably people like you and me out of the running
the curious fact remains that chad himself isn't
the situation doesn't make for it but in a different one he could have her if he would
yes but that's only because he's rich and because there's a possibility of his being richer
they won't think of anything but a great name or a great fortune
well said strether he'll have no great fortune on these lines
he must stir his stumps
is that little bilham enquired what you were saying to madame de vionnet
noi don't say much to her
of course however strether continued he can make sacrifices if he likes
little bilham had a pause
oh he's not keen for sacrifices or thinks that is possibly that he has made enough
well it is virtuous his companion observed with some decision
that's exactly the young man dropped after a moment what i mean
it kept strether himself silent a little
i've made it out for myself he then went on i've really within the last halfhour got hold of it
i understand it in short at last which at firstwhen you originally spoke to mei didn't
nor when chad originally spoke to me either
oh said little bilham i don't think that at that time you believed me
yesi did and i believed chad too
it would have been odious and unmannerlyas well as quite perverseif i hadn't
what interest have you in deceiving me
the young man cast about
what interest have i
yes
chad might have
but you
ah ah ah
little bilham exclaimed
it might on repetition as a mystification have irritated our friend a little but he knew once more as we have seen where he was and his being proof against everything was only another attestation that he meant to stay there
i couldn't without my own impression realise
she's a tremendously clever brilliant capable woman and with an extraordinary charm on top of it allthe charm we surely all of us this evening know what to think of
it isn't every clever brilliant capable woman that has it
in fact it's rare with any woman
so there you are strether proceeded as if not for little bilham's benefit alone
i understand what a relation with such a womanwhat such a high fine friendshipmay be
it can't be vulgar or coarse anywayand that's the point
yes that's the point said little bilham
it can't be vulgar or coarse
and bless us and save us it isn't
it's upon my word the very finest thing i ever saw in my life and the most distinguished
strether from beside him and leaning back with him as he leaned dropped on him a momentary look which filled a short interval and of which he took no notice
he only gazed before him with intent participation
of course what it has done for him strether at all events presently pursued of course what it has done for himthat is as to how it has so wonderfully workedisn't a thing i pretend to understand
i've to take it as i find it
there he is
there he is
little bilham echoed
and it's really and truly she
i don't understand either even with my longer and closer opportunity
but i'm like you he added i can admire and rejoice even when i'm a little in the dark
you see i've watched it for some three years and especially for this last
he wasn't so bad before it as i seem to have made out that you think  oh i don't think anything now
strether impatiently broke in that is but what i do think
i mean that originally for her to have cared for him  there must have been stuff in him
oh yes there was stuff indeed and much more of it than ever showed i dare say at home
still you know the young man in all fairness developed there was room for her and that's where she came in
she saw her chance and took it
that's what strikes me as having been so fine
but of course he wound up he liked her first
naturally said strether
i mean that they first met somehow and somewherei believe in some american houseand she without in the least then intending it made her impression
then with time and opportunity he made his and after that she was as bad as he
strether vaguely took it up
as 'bad'
she began that is to careto care very much
alone and in her horrid position she found it when once she had started an interest
it was it is an interest and it didit continues to doa lot for herself as well
so she still cares
she cares in fact said little bilham thoughtfully more
strether's theory that it was none of his business was somehow not damaged by the way he took this
more you mean than he
on which his companion looked round at him and now for an instant their eyes met
more than he
he repeated
little bilham for as long hung fire
will you never tell any one
strether thought
whom should i tell
why i supposed you reported regularly  to people at home
strether took him up
well i won't tell them this
the young man at last looked away
then she does now care more than he
oh
strether oddly exclaimed
but his companion immediately met it
haven't you after all had your impression of it
that's how you've got hold of him
ah but i haven't got hold of him
oh i say
but it was all little bilham said
it's at any rate none of my business
i mean strether explained nothing else than getting hold of him is
it appeared however to strike him as his business to add  the fact remains nevertheless that she has saved him
little bilham just waited
i thought that was what you were to do
but strether had his answer ready
i'm speakingin connexion with herof his manners and morals his character and life
i'm speaking of him as a person to deal with and talk with and live withspeaking of him as a social animal
and isn't it as a social animal that you also want him
certainly so that it's as if she had saved him for us
it strikes you accordingly then the young man threw out as for you all to save her
oh for us 'all'
strether could but laugh at that
it brought him back however to the point he had really wished to make
they've accepted their situationhard as it is
they're not freeat least she's not but they take what's left to them
it's a friendship of a beautiful sort and that's what makes them so strong
they're straight they feel and they keep each other up
it's doubtless she however who as you yourself have hinted feels it most
little bilham appeared to wonder what he had hinted
feels most that they're straight
well feels that she is and the strength that comes from it
she keeps him upshe keeps the whole thing up
when people are able to it's fine
she's wonderful wonderful as miss barrace says and he is in his way too however as a mere man he may sometimes rebel and not feel that he finds his account in it
she has simply given him an immense moral lift and what that can explain is prodigious
that's why i speak of it as a situation
it is one if there ever was
and strether with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling seemed to lose himself in the vision of it
his companion attended deeply
you state it much better than i could
oh you see it doesn't concern you
little bilham considered
i thought you said just now that it doesn't concern you either
well it doesn't a bit as madame de vionnet's affair
but as we were again saying just now what did i come out for but to save him
yesto remove him
to save him by removal to win him over to himself thinking it best he shall take up businessthinking he must immediately do therefore what's necessary to that end
well said little bilham after a moment you have won him over
he does think it best
he has within a day or two again said to me as much
and that strether asked is why you consider that he cares less than she
cares less for her than she for him
yes that's one of the reasons
but other things too have given me the impression
a man don't you think
little bilham presently pursued can't in such conditions care so much as a woman
it takes different conditions to make him and then perhaps he cares more
chad he wound up has his possible future before him
are you speaking of his business future
noon the contrary of the other the future of what you so justly call their situation
m de vionnet may live for ever
so that they can't marry
the young man waited a moment
not being able to marry is all they've with any confidence to look forward to
a womana particular womanmay stand that strain
but can a man
he propounded
strether's answer was as prompt as if he had already for himself worked it out
not without a very high ideal of conduct
but that's just what we're attributing to chad
and how for that matter he mused does his going to america diminish the particular strain
wouldn't it seem rather to add to it
out of sight out of mind
his companion laughed
then more bravely wouldn't distance lessen the torment
but before strether could reply the thing is you see chad ought to marry
he wound up
strether for a little appeared to think of it
if you talk of torments you don't diminish mine
he then broke out
the next moment he was on his feet with a question
he ought to marry whom
little bilham rose more slowly
well some one he cansome thoroughly nice girl
strether's eyes as they stood together turned again to jeanne
do you mean her
his friend made a sudden strange face
after being in love with her mother
no
but isn't it exactly your idea that he isn't in love with her mother
his friend once more had a pause
well he isn't at any rate in love with jeanne
i dare say not
how can he be with any other woman
oh that i admit
but being in love isn't you know herelittle bilham spoke in friendly reminderthought necessary in strictness for marriage
and what tormentto call a tormentcan there ever possibly be with a woman like that
as if from the interest of his own question strether had gone on without hearing
is it for her to have turned a man out so wonderfully too only for somebody else
he appeared to make a point of this and little bilham looked at him now
when it's for each other that people give things up they don't miss them
then he threw off as with an extravagance of which he was conscious let them face the future together
little bilham looked at him indeed
you mean that after all he shouldn't go back
i mean that if he gives her up
yes
well he ought to be ashamed of himself
but strether spoke with a sound that might have passed for a laugh
volume ii  book seventh     i   it wasn't the first time strether had sat alone in the great dim churchstill less was it the first of his giving himself up so far as conditions permitted to its beneficent action on his nerves
he had been to notre dame with waymarsh he had been there with miss gostrey he had been there with chad newsome and had found the place even in company such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that with renewed pressure from that source he had not unnaturally recurred to a remedy meeting the case for the moment so indirectly no doubt but so relievingly
he was conscious enough that it was only for the moment but good momentsif he could call them goodstill had their value for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost disgracefully from hand to mouth
having so well learnt the way he had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by himselfhad quite stolen off taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking of the adventure when restored to his friends
his great friend for that matter was still absent as well as remarkably silent even at the end of three weeks miss gostrey hadn't come back
she wrote to him from mentone admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequentperhaps in fact for the time odiously faithless but asking for patience for a deferred sentence throwing herself in short on his generosity
for her too she could assure him life was complicatedmore complicated than he could have guessed she had moreover made certain of himcertain of not wholly missing him on her returnbefore her disappearance
if furthermore she didn't burden him with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on
he himself at the end of a fortnight had written twice to show how his generosity could be trusted but he reminded himself in each case of mrs newsome's epistolary manner at the times when mrs newsome kept off delicate ground
he sank his problem he talked of waymarsh and miss barrace of little bilham and the set over the river with whom he had again had tea and he was easy for convenience about chad and madame de vionnet and jeanne
he admitted that he continued to see them he was decidedly so confirmed a haunter of chad's premises and that young man's practical intimacy with them was so undeniably great but he had his reason for not attempting to render for miss gostrey's benefit the impression of these last days
that would be to tell her too much about himselfit being at present just from himself he was trying to escape
this small struggle sprang not a little in its way from the same impulse that had now carried him across to notre dame the impulse to let things be to give them time to justify themselves or at least to pass
he was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be for the hour in certain other places a sense of safety of simplification which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice
the great church had no altar for his worship no direct voice for his soul but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity for he could feel while there what he couldn't elsewhere that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned
he was tired but he wasn't plainthat was the pity and the trouble of it he was able however to drop his problem at the door very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited on the threshold in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar
he trod the long dim nave sat in the splendid choir paused before the cluttered chapels of the east end and the mighty monument laid upon him its spell
he might have been a student under the charm of a museumwhich was exactly what in a foreign town in the afternoon of life he would have liked to be free to be
this form of sacrifice did at any rate for the occasion as well as another it made him quite sufficiently understand how within the precinct for the real refugee the things of the world could fall into abeyance
that was the cowardice probablyto dodge them to beg the question not to deal with it in the hard outer light but his own oblivions were too brief too vain to hurt any one but himself and he had a vague and fanciful kindness for certain persons whom he met figures of mystery and anxiety and whom with observation for his pastime he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice
justice was outside in the hard light and injustice too but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars
thus it was at all events that one morning some dozen days after the dinner in the boulevard malesherbes at which madame de vionnet had been present with her daughter he was called upon to play his part in an encounter that deeply stirred his imagination
he had the habit in these contemplations of watching a fellow visitant here and there from a respectable distance remarking some note of behaviour of penitence of prostration of the absolved relieved state this was the manner in which his vague tenderness took its course the degree of demonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself
it hadn't indeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly measured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness in the shade of one of the chapels he had two or three times noticed as he made and made once more his slow circuit
she wasn't prostratenot in any degree bowed but she was strangely fixed and her prolonged immobility showed her while he passed and paused as wholly given up to the need whatever it was that had brought her there
she only sat and gazed before her as he himself often sat but she had placed herself as he never did within the focus of the shrine and she had lost herself he could easily see as he would only have liked to do
she was not a wandering alien keeping back more than she gave but one of the familiar the intimate the fortunate for whom these dealings had a method and a meaning
she reminded our friendsince it was the way of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of things imaginedof some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story something he had heard read something that had he had a hand for drama he might himself have written renewing her courage renewing her clearness in splendidlyprotected meditation
her back as she sat was turned to him but his impression absolutely required that she should be young and interesting and she carried her head moreover even in the sacred shade with a discernible faith in herself a kind of implied conviction of consistency security impunity
but what had such a woman come for if she hadn't come to pray
strether's reading of such matters was it must be owned confused but he wondered if her attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution of indulgence
he knew but dimly what indulgence in such a place might mean yet he had as with a soft sweep a vision of how it might indeed add to the zest of active rites
all this was a good deal to have been denoted by a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him but the last thing before leaving the church he had the surprise of a still deeper quickening
he had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and again in the museum mood was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft to reconstitute a past to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of victor hugo whom a few days before giving the rein for once in a way to the joy of life he had purchased in seventy bound volumes a miracle of cheapness parted with he was assured by the shopman at the price of the redandgold alone
he looked doubtless while he played his eternal nippers over gothic glooms sufficiently rapt in reverence but what his thought had finally bumped against was the question of where among packed accumulations so multiform a wedge would be able to enter
were seventy volumes in redandgold to be perhaps what he should most substantially have to show at woollett as the fruit of his mission
it was a possibility that held him a minuteheld him till he happened to feel that some one unnoticed had approached him and paused
turning he saw that a lady stood there as for a greeting and he sprang up as he next took her securely for madame de vionnet who appeared to have recognised him as she passed near him on her way to the door
she checked quickly and gaily a certain confusion in him came to meet it turned it back by an art of her own the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the person he had lately been observing
she was the lurking figure of the dim chapel she had occupied him more than she guessed but it came to him in time luckily that he needn't tell her and that no harm after all had been done
she herself for that matter straightway showing she felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents had for him a you come here too
that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness
i come often she said
i love this place but i'm terrible in general for churches
the old women who live in them all know me in fact i'm already myself one of the old women
it's like that at all events that i foresee i shall end
looking about for a chair so that he instantly pulled one nearer she sat down with him again to the sound of an oh i like so much your also being fond
he confessed the extent of his feeling though she left the object vague and he was struck with the tact the taste of her vagueness which simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things
he was conscious of how much it was affected this sense by something subdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her special object and her morning walkhe believed her to have come on foot the way her slightly thicker veil was drawna mere touch but everything the composed gravity of her dress in which here and there a dull winecolour seemed to gleam faintly through black the charming discretion of her small compact head the quiet note as she sat of her folded greygloved hands
it was to strether's mind as if she sat on her own ground the light honours of which at an open gate she thus easily did him while all the vastness and mystery of the domain stretched off behind
when people were so completely in possession they could be extraordinarily civil and our friend had indeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage
she was romantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed and again he found his small comfort in the conviction that subtle though she was his impression must remain a secret from her
the thing that once more made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular patience she could have with his own want of colour albeit that on the other hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive
the moments had already for that matter drawn their deepest tinge from the special interest excited in him by his vision of his companion's identity with the person whose attitude before the glimmering altar had so impressed him
this attitude fitted admirably into the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with chad on the last occasion of his seeing them together
it helped him to stick fast at the point he had then reached it was there he had resolved that he would stick and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do so
unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the parties to it so carry herself
if it wasn't innocent why did she haunt the churchesinto which given the woman he could believe he made out she would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt
she haunted them for continued help for strength for peacesublime support which if one were able to look at it so she found from day to day
they talked in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks about the great monument and its history and its beautyall of which madame de vionnet professed came to her most in the other the outer view
we'll presently after we go she said walk round it again if you like
i'm not in a particular hurry and it will be pleasant to look at it well with you
he had spoken of the great romancer and the great romance and of what to his imagination they had done for the whole mentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase the seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion
out of proportion to what
well to any other plunge
yet he felt even as he spoke how at that instant he was plunging
he had made up his mind and was impatient to get into the air for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside and he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him
she however took her time she drew out their quiet gossip as if she had wished to profit by their meeting and this confirmed precisely an interpretation of her manner of her mystery
while she rose as he would have called it to the question of victor hugo her voice itself the light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them seemed to make her words mean something that they didn't mean openly
help strength peace a sublime supportshe hadn't found so much of these things as that the amount wouldn't be sensibly greater for any scrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her hand
every little in a long strain helped and if he happened to affect her as a firm object she could hold on by he wouldn't jerk himself out of her reach
people in difficulties held on by what was nearest and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of comfort more abstract
it was as to this he had made up his mind he had made it up that is to give her a sign
the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairhe understood the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairshe was free to clutch
since she took him for a firm objectmuch as he might to his own sense appear at times to rockhe would do his best to be one
the end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for an early luncheon at a wonderful a delightful house of entertainment on the left banka place of pilgrimage for the knowing they were both aware the knowing who came for its great renown the homage of restless days from the other end of the town
strether had already been there three timesfirst with miss gostrey then with chad then with chad again and with waymarsh and little bilham all of whom he had himself sagaciously entertained and his pleasure was deep now on learning that madame de vionnet hadn't yet been initiated
when he had said as they strolled round the church by the river acting at last on what within he had made up his mind to will you if you have time come to dejeuner with me somewhere
for instance if you know it over there on the other side which is so easy a walkand then had named the place when he had done this she stopped short as for quick intensity and yet deep difficulty of response
she took in the proposal as if it were almost too charming to be true and there had perhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of prideso fine so odd a case at any rate as his finding himself thus able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new a rare amusement
she had heard of the happy spot but she asked him in reply to a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have been there
he supposed himself to have supposed that chad might have taken her and she guessed this the next moment to his no small discomfort
ah let me explain she smiled that i don't go about with him in public i never have such chancesnot having them otherwiseand it's just the sort of thing that as a quiet creature living in my hole i adore
it was more than kind of him to have thought of itthough frankly if he asked whether she had time she hadn't a single minute
that however made no differenceshe'd throw everything over
every duty at home domestic maternal social awaited her but it was a case for a high line
her affairs would go to smash but hadn't one a right to one's snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay
it was on this pleasant basis of costly disorder consequently that they eventually seated themselves on either side of a small table at a window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining bargeburdened seine where for an hour in the matter of letting himself go of diving deep strether was to feel he had touched bottom
he was to feel many things on this occasion and one of the first of them was that he had travelled far since that evening in london before the theatre when his dinner with maria gostrey between the pinkshaded candles had struck him as requiring so many explanations
he had at that time gathered them in the explanationshe had stored them up but it was at present as if he had either soared above or sunk below themhe couldn't tell which he could somehow think of none that didn't seem to leave the appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity
how could he wish it to be lucid for others for any one that he for the hour saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered waterside life came in at the open windowthe mere way madame de vionnet opposite him over their intensely white tablelinen their omelette aux tomates their bottle of strawcoloured chablis thanked him for everything almost with the smile of a child while her grey eyes moved in and out of their talk back to the quarter of the warm spring air in which early summer had already begun to throb and then back again to his face and their human questions
their human questions became many before they had donemany more as one after the other came up than our friend's free fancy had at all foreseen
the sense he had had before the sense he had had repeatedly the sense that the situation was running away with him had never been so sharp as now and all the more that he could perfectly put his finger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth
that accident had definitely occurred the other evening after chad's dinner it had occurred as he fully knew at the moment when he interposed between this lady and her child when he suffered himself so to discuss with her a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety marked by its significant thank you
instantly sealed the occasion in her favour
again he had held off for ten days but the situation had continued out of hand in spite of that the fact that it was running so fast being indeed just why he had held off
what had come over him as he recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could be but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by her subtlety but by the hand of fate itself
if all the accidents were to fight on her sideand by the actual showing they loomed largehe could only give himself up
this was what he had done in privately deciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him
what did the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which a regular runaway properly ends
the smash was their walk their dejeuner their omelette the chablis the place the view their present talk and his present pleasure in itto say nothing wonder of wonders of her own
to this tune and nothing less accordingly was his surrender made good
it sufficiently lighted up at least the folly of holding off
ancient proverbs sounded for his memory in the tone of their words and the clink of their glasses in the hum of the town and the plash of the river
it was clearly better to suffer as a sheep than as a lamb
one might as well perish by the sword as by famine
maria's still away
that was the first thing she had asked him and when he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the meaning he knew her to attach to miss gostrey's absence she had gone on to enquire if he didn't tremendously miss her
there were reasons that made him by no means sure yet he nevertheless answered tremendously which she took in as if it were all she had wished to prove
then a man in trouble must be possessed somehow of a woman she said if she doesn't come in one way she comes in another
why do you call me a man in trouble
ah because that's the way you strike me
she spoke ever so gently and as if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his bounty
aren't you in trouble
he felt himself colour at the question and then hated thathated to pass for anything so idiotic as woundable
woundable by chad's lady in respect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifferencewas he already at that point
perversely none the less his pause gave a strange air of truth to her supposition and what was he in fact but disconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed of not doing
i'm not in trouble yet he at last smiled
i'm not in trouble now
well i'm always so
but that you sufficiently know
she was a woman who between courses could be graceful with her elbows on the table
it was a posture unknown to mrs newsome but it was easy for a femme du monde
yesi am 'now'
there was a question you put to me he presently returned the night of chad's dinner
i didn't answer it then and it has been very handsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it since
she was instantly all there
of course i know what you allude to
i asked you what you had meant by saying the day you came to see me just before you left me that you'd save me
and you then saidat our friend'sthat you'd have really to wait to see for yourself what you did mean
yes i asked for time said strether
and it sounds now as you put it like a very ridiculous speech
oh
she murmuredshe was full of attenuation
but she had another thought
if it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that you're in trouble
ah if i were he replied it wouldn't be the trouble of fearing ridicule
i don't fear it
what then do you
nothingnow
and he leaned back in his chair
i like your 'now'
she laughed across at him
well it's precisely that it fully comes to me at present that i've kept you long enough
i know by this time at any rate what i meant by my speech and i really knew it the night of chad's dinner
then why didn't you tell me
because it was difficult at the moment
i had already at that moment done something for you in the sense of what i had said the day i went to see you but i wasn't then sure of the importance i might represent this as having
she was all eagerness
and you're sure now
yes i see that practically i've done for youhad done for you when you put me your questionall that it's as yet possible to me to do
i feel now he went on that it may go further than i thought
what i did after my visit to you he explained was to write straight off to mrs newsome about you and i'm at last from one day to the other expecting her answer
it's this answer that will represent as i believe the consequences
patient and beautiful was her interest
i seethe consequences of your speaking for me
and she waited as if not to hustle him
he acknowledged it by immediately going on
the question you understand was how i should save you
well i'm trying it by thus letting her know that i consider you worth saving
i seei see
her eagerness broke through
how can i thank you enough
he couldn't tell her that however and she quickly pursued
you do really for yourself consider it
his only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been freshly put before them
i've written to her again since theni've left her in no doubt of what i think
i've told her all about you
thanksnot so much
'all about' me she went onyes
all it seems to me you've done for him
ah and you might have added all it seems to me
she laughed again while she took up her knife and fork as in the cheer of these assurances
but you're not sure how she'll take it
no i'll not pretend i'm sure
voila
and she waited a moment
i wish you'd tell me about her
oh said strether with a slightly strained smile all that need concern you about her is that she's really a grand person
madame de vionnet seemed to demur
is that all that need concern me about her
but strether neglected the question
hasn't chad talked to you
of his mother
yes a great dealimmensely
but not from your point of view
he can't our friend returned have said any ill of her
not the least bit
he has given me like you the assurance that she's really grand
but her being really grand is somehow just what hasn't seemed to simplify our case
nothing she continued is further from me than to wish to say a word against her but of course i feel how little she can like being told of her owing me anything
no woman ever enjoys such an obligation to another woman
this was a proposition strether couldn't contradict
and yet what other way could i have expressed to her what i felt
it's what there was most to say about you
do you mean then that she will be good to me
it's what i'm waiting to see
but i've little doubt she would he added if she could comfortably see you
it seemed to strike her as a happy a beneficent thought
oh then couldn't that be managed
wouldn't she come out
wouldn't she if you so put it to her
did you by any possibility
she faintly quavered
oh nohe was prompt
not that
it would be much more to give an account of you thatsince there's no question of your paying the visiti should go home first
it instantly made her graver
and are you thinking of that
oh all the while naturally
stay with usstay with us
she exclaimed on this
that's your only way to make sure
to make sure of what
why that he doesn't break up
you didn't come out to do that to him
doesn't it depend strether returned after a moment on what you mean by breaking up
oh you know well enough what i mean
his silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding
you take for granted remarkable things
yes i doto the extent that i don't take for granted vulgar ones
you're perfectly capable of seeing that what you came out for wasn't really at all to do what you'd now have to do
ah it's perfectly simple strether goodhumouredly pleaded
i've had but one thing to doto put our case before him
to put it as it could only be put here on the spotby personal pressure
my dear lady he lucidly pursued my work you see is really done and my reasons for staying on even another day are none of the best
chad's in possession of our case and professes to do it full justice
what remains is with himself
i've had my rest my amusement and refreshment i've had as we say at woollett a lovely time
nothing in it has been more lovely than this happy meeting with youin these fantastic conditions to which you've so delightfully consented
i've a sense of success
it's what i wanted
my getting all this good is what chad has waited for and i gather that if i'm ready to go he's the same
she shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom
you're not ready
if you're ready why did you write to mrs newsome in the sense you've mentioned to me
strether considered
i shan't go before i hear from her
you're too much afraid of her he added
it produced between them a long look from which neither shrank
i don't think you believe thatbelieve i've not really reason to fear her
she's capable of great generosity strether presently stated
well then let her trust me a little
that's all i ask
let her recognise in spite of everything what i've done
ah remember our friend replied that she can't effectually recognise it without seeing it for herself
let chad go over and show her what you've done and let him plead with her there for it and as it were for you
she measured the depth of this suggestion
do you give me your word of honour that if she once has him there she won't do her best to marry him
it made her companion this enquiry look again a while out at the view after which he spoke without sharpness
when she sees for herself what he is  but she had already broken in
it's when she sees for herself what he is that she'll want to marry him most
strether's attitude that of due deference to what she said permitted him to attend for a minute to his luncheon
i doubt if that will come off
it won't be easy to make it
it will be easy if he remains thereand he'll remain for the money
the money appears to be as a probability so hideously much
well strether presently concluded nothing could really hurt you but his marrying
she gave a strange light laugh
putting aside what may really hurt him
but her friend looked at her as if he had thought of that too
the question will come up of course of the future that you yourself offer him
she was leaning back now but she fully faced him
well let it come up
the point is that it's for chad to make of it what he can
his being proof against marriage will show what he does make
if he is proof yesshe accepted the proposition
but for myself she added the question is what you make
ah i make nothing
it's not my affair
i beg your pardon
it's just there that since you've taken it up and are committed to it it most intensely becomes yours
you're not saving me i take it for your interest in myself but for your interest in our friend
the one's at any rate wholly dependent on the other
you can't in honour not see me through she wound up because you can't in honour not see him
strange and beautiful to him was her quiet soft acuteness
the thing that most moved him was really that she was so deeply serious
she had none of the portentous forms of it but he had never come in contact it struck him with a force brought to so fine a head
mrs newsome goodness knew was serious but it was nothing to this
he took it all in he saw it all together
no he mused i can't in honour not see him
her face affected him as with an exquisite light
you will then
i will
at this she pushed back her chair and was the next moment on her feet
thank you
she said with her hand held out to him across the table and with no less a meaning in the words than her lips had so particularly given them after chad's dinner
the golden nail she had then driven in pierced a good inch deeper
yet he reflected that he himself had only meanwhile done what he had made up his mind to on the same occasion
so far as the essence of the matter went he had simply stood fast on the spot on which he had then planted his feet
ii   he received three days after this a communication from america in the form of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed not reaching him through his bankers but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in uniform who under instructions from the concierge approached him as he slowly paced the little court
it was the evening hour but daylight was long now and paris more than ever penetrating
the scent of flowers was in the streets he had the whiff of violets perpetually in his nose and he had attached himself to sounds and suggestions vibrations of the air human and dramatic he imagined as they were not in other places that came out for him more and more as the mild afternoons deepeneda faroff hum a sharp near click on the asphalt a voice calling replying somewhere and as full of tone as an actor's in a play
he was to dine at home as usual with waymarshthey had settled to that for thrift and simplicity and he now hung about before his friend came down
he read his telegram in the court standing still a long time where he had opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study of it
at last quickly he crumpled it up as if to get it out of the way in spite of which however he kept it therestill kept it when at the end of another turn he had dropped into a chair placed near a small table
here with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and further concealed by his folding his arms tight he sat for some time in thought gazed before him so straight that waymarsh appeared and approached him without catching his eye
the latter in fact struck with his appearance looked at him hard for a single instant and then as if determined to that course by some special vividness in it dropped back into the salon de lecture without addressing him
but the pilgrim from milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene from behind the clear glass plate of that retreat
strether ended as he sat by a fresh scrutiny of his compressed missive which he smoothed out carefully again as he placed it on his table
there it remained for some minutes until at last looking up he saw waymarsh watching him from within
it was on this that their eyes metmet for a moment during which neither moved
but strether then got up folding his telegram more carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket
a few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner but strether had meanwhile said nothing about it and they eventually parted after coffee in the court with nothing said on either side
our friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was on this occasion said between them so that it was almost as if each had been waiting for something from the other
waymarsh had always more or less the air of sitting at the door of his tent and silence after so many weeks had come to play its part in their concert
this note indeed to strether's sense had lately taken a fuller tone and it was his fancy tonight that they had never quite so drawn it out
yet it befell none the less that he closed the door to confidence when his companion finally asked him if there were anything particular the matter with him
nothing he replied more than usual
on the morrow however at an early hour he found occasion to give an answer more in consonance with the facts
what was the matter had continued to be so all the previous evening the first hours of which after dinner in his room he had devoted to the copious composition of a letter
he had quitted waymarsh for this purpose leaving him to his own resources with less ceremony than their wont but finally coming down again with his letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets without enquiry for his comrade
he had taken a long vague walk and one o'clock had struck before his return and his reascent to his room by the aid of the glimmering candleend left for him on the shelf outside the porter's lodge
he had possessed himself on closing his door of the numerous loose sheets of his unfinished composition and then without reading them over had torn them into small pieces
he had thereupon sleptas if it had been in some measure thanks to that sacrificethe sleep of the just and had prolonged his rest considerably beyond his custom
thus it was that when between nine and ten the tap of the knob of a walkingstick sounded on his door he had not yet made himself altogether presentable
chad newsome's bright deep voice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the visitor
the little blue paper of the evening before plainly an object the more precious for its escape from premature destruction now lay on the sill of the open window smoothed out afresh and kept from blowing away by the superincumbent weight of his watch
chad looking about with careless and competent criticism as he looked wherever he went immediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment rather hard
after which he turned his eyes to his host
it has come then at last
strether paused in the act of pinning his necktie
then you know
you've had one too
no i've had nothing and i only know what i see
i see that thing and i guess
well he added it comes as pat as in a play for i've precisely turned up this morningas i would have done yesterday but it was impossibleto take you
to take me
strether had turned again to his glass
back at last as i promised
i'm readyi've really been ready this month
i've only been waiting for youas was perfectly right
but you're better now you're safei see that for myself you've got all your good
you're looking this morning as fit as a flea
strether at his glass finished dressing consulting that witness moreover on this last opinion
was he looking preternaturally fit
there was something in it perhaps for chad's wonderful eye but he had felt himself for hours rather in pieces
such a judgement however was after all but a contribution to his resolve it testified unwittingly to his wisdom
he was still firmer apparentlysince it shone in him as a lightthan he had flattered himself
his firmness indeed was slightly compromised as he faced about to his friend by the way this very personage lookedthough the case would of course have been worse hadn't the secret of personal magnificence been at every hour chad's unfailing possession
there he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of itstrong and sleek and gay easy and fragrant and fathomless with happy health in his colour and pleasant silver in his thick young hair and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear brownness caused to show as red
he had never struck strether as personally such a success it was as if now for his definite surrender he had gathered himself vividly together
this sharply and rather strangely was the form in which he was to be presented to woollett
our friend took him in againhe was always taking him in and yet finding that parts of him still remained out though even thus his image showed through a mist of other things
i've had a cable strether said from your mother
i dare say my dear man
i hope she's well
strether hesitated
noshe's not well i'm sorry to have to tell you
ah said chad i must have had the instinct of it
all the more reason then that we should start straight off
strether had now got together hat gloves and stick but chad had dropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point
he kept observing his companion's things he might have been judging how quickly they could be packed
he might even have wished to hint that he'd send his own servant to assist
what do you mean strether enquired by 'straight off'
oh by one of next week's boats
everything at this season goes out so light that berths will be easy anywhere
strether had in his hand his telegram which he had kept there after attaching his watch and he now offered it to chad who however with an odd movement declined to take it
thanks i'd rather not
your correspondence with mother's your own affair
i'm only with you both on it whatever it is
strether at this while their eyes met slowly folded the missive and put it in his pocket after which before he had spoken again chad broke fresh ground
has miss gostrey come back
but when strether presently spoke it wasn't in answer
it's not i gather that your mother's physically ill her health on the whole this spring seems to have been better than usual
but she's worried she's anxious and it appears to have risen within the last few days to a climax
we've tired out between us her patience
oh it isn't you
chad generously protested
i beg your pardonit is me
strether was mild and melancholy but firm
he saw it far away and over his companion's head
it's very particularly me
well then all the more reason
marchons marchons
said the young man gaily
his host however at this but continued to stand agaze and he had the next thing repeated his question of a moment before
has miss gostrey come back
yes two days ago
then you've seen her
noi'm to see her today
but strether wouldn't linger now on miss gostrey
your mother sends me an ultimatum
if i can't bring you i'm to leave you i'm to come at any rate myself
ah but you can bring me now chad from his sofa reassuringly replied
strether had a pause
i don't think i understand you
why was it that more than a month ago you put it to me so urgently to let madame de vionnet speak for you
'why'
chad considered but he had it at his fingers' ends
why but because i knew how well she'd do it
it was the way to keep you quiet and to that extent do you good
besides he happily and comfortably explained i wanted you really to know her and to get the impression of herand you see the good that has done you
well said strether the way she has spoken for you all the sameso far as i've given her a chancehas only made me feel how much she wishes to keep you
if you make nothing of that i don't see why you wanted me to listen to her
why my dear man chad exclaimed i make everything of it
how can you doubt
i doubt only because you come to me this morning with your signal to start
chad stared then gave a laugh
and isn't my signal to start just what you've been waiting for
strether debated he took another turn
this last month i've been awaiting i think more than anything else the message i have here
you mean you've been afraid of it
well i was doing my business in my own way
and i suppose your present announcement strether went on isn't merely the result of your sense of what i've expected
otherwise you wouldn't have put me in relation but he paused pulling up
at this chad rose
ah her wanting me not to go has nothing to do with it
it's only because she's afraidafraid of the way that over there i may get caught
but her fear's groundless
he had met again his companion's sufficiently searching look
are you tired of her
chad gave him in reply to this with a movement of the head the strangest slow smile he had ever had from him
never
it had immediately on strether's imagination so deep and soft an effect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him
never
never chad obligingly and serenely repeated
it made his companion take several more steps
then you're not afraid
afraid to go
strether pulled up again
afraid to stay
the young man looked brightly amazed
you want me now to 'stay'
if i don't immediately sail the pococks will immediately come out
that's what i mean said strether by your mother's ultimatum 
chad showed a still livelier but not an alarmed interest
she has turned on sarah and jim
strether joined him for an instant in the vision
oh and you may be sure mamie
that's whom she's turning on
this also chad sawhe laughed out
mamieto corrupt me
ah said strether she's very charming
so you've already more than once told me
i should like to see her
something happy and easy something above all unconscious in the way he said this brought home again to his companion the facility of his attitude and the enviability of his state
see her then by all means
and consider too strether went on that you really give your sister a lift in letting her come to you
you give her a couple of months of paris which she hasn't seen if i'm not mistaken since just after she was married and which i'm sure she wants but the pretext to visit
chad listened but with all his own knowledge of the world
she has had it the pretext these several years yet she has never taken it
do you mean you
strether after an instant enquired
certainlythe lone exile
and whom do you mean
said chad
oh i mean me
i'm her pretext
that isfor it comes to the same thingi'm your mother's
then why chad asked doesn't mother come herself
his friend gave him a long look
should you like her to
and as he for the moment said nothing it's perfectly open to you to cable for her
chad continued to think
will she come if i do
quite possibly
but try and you'll see
why don't you try
chad after a moment asked
because i don't want to
chad thought
don't desire her presence here
strether faced the question and his answer was the more emphatic
don't put it off my dear boy on me
welli see what you mean
i'm sure you'd behave beautifully but you don't want to see her
so i won't play you that trick'
ah strether declared i shouldn't call it a trick
you've a perfect right and it would be perfectly straight of you
then he added in a different tone you'd have moreover in the person of madame de vionnet a very interesting relation prepared for her
their eyes on this proposition continued to meet but chad's pleasant and bold never flinched for a moment
he got up at last and he said something with which strether was struck
she wouldn't understand her but that makes no difference
madame de vionnet would like to see her
she'd like to be charming to her
she believes she could work it
strether thought a moment affected by this but finally turning away
she couldn't
you're quite sure
chad asked
well risk it if you like
strether who uttered this with serenity had urged a plea for their now getting into the air but the young man still waited
have you sent your answer
no i've done nothing yet
were you waiting to see me
no not that
only waitingand chad with this had a smile for himto see miss gostrey
nonot even miss gostrey
i wasn't waiting to see any one
i had only waited till now to make up my mindin complete solitude and since i of course absolutely owe you the information was on the point of going out with it quite made up
have therefore a little more patience with me
remember strether went on that that's what you originally asked me to have
i've had it you see and you see what has come of it
stay on with me
chad looked grave
how much longer
well till i make you a sign
i can't myself you know at the best or at the worst stay for ever
let the pococks come strether repeated
because it gains you time
yesit gains me time
chad as if it still puzzled him waited a minute
you don't want to get back to mother
not just yet
i'm not ready
you feel chad asked in a tone of his own the charm of life over here
immensely
strether faced it
you've helped me so to feel it that that surely needn't surprise you
no it doesn't surprise me and i'm delighted
but what my dear man chad went on with conscious queerness does it all lead to for you
the change of position and of relation for each was so oddly betrayed in the question that chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered itwhich made strether also laugh
well to my having a certitude that has been testedthat has passed through the fire
but oh he couldn't help breaking out if within my first month here you had been willing to move with me
well
said chad while he broke down as for weight of thought
well we should have been over there by now
ah but you wouldn't have had your fun
i should have had a month of it and i'm having now if you want to know strether continued enough to last me for the rest of my days
chad looked amused and interested yet still somewhat in the dark partly perhaps because strether's estimate of fun had required of him from the first a good deal of elucidation
it wouldn't do if i left you
left me
strether remained blank
only for a month or twotime to go and come
madame de vionnet chad smiled would look after you in the interval
to go back by yourself i remaining here
again for an instant their eyes had the question out after which strether said grotesque
but i want to see mother chad presently returned
remember how long it is since i've seen mother
long indeed and that's exactly why i was originally so keen for moving you
hadn't you shown us enough how beautifully you could do without it
oh but said chad wonderfully i'm better now
there was an easy triumph in it that made his friend laugh out again
oh if you were worse i should know what to do with you
in that case i believe i'd have you gagged and strapped down carried on board resisting kicking
how much strether asked do you want to see mother
how much
chad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say
how much
why as much as you've made me
i'd give anything to see her
and you've left me chad went on in little enough doubt as to how much she wants it
strether thought a minute
well then if those things are really your motive catch the french steamer and sail tomorrow
of course when it comes to that you're absolutely free to do as you choose
from the moment you can't hold yourself i can only accept your flight
i'll fly in a minute then said chad if you'll stay here
i'll stay here till the next steamerthen i'll follow you
and do you call that chad asked accepting my flight
certainlyit's the only thing to call it
the only way to keep me here accordingly strether explained is by staying yourself
chad took it in
all the more that i've really dished you eh
dished me
strether echoed as inexpressively as possible
why if she sends out the pococks it will be that she doesn't trust you and if she doesn't trust you that bears uponwell you know what
strether decided after a moment that he did know what and in consonance with this he spoke
you see then all the more what you owe me
well if i do see how can i pay
by not deserting me
by standing by me
oh i say
but chad as they went downstairs clapped a firm hand in the manner of a pledge upon his shoulder
they descended slowly together and had in the court of the hotel some further talk of which the upshot was that they presently separated
chad newsome departed and strether left alone looked about superficially for waymarsh
but waymarsh hadn't yet it appeared come down and our friend finally went forth without sight of him
iii   at four o'clock that afternoon he had still not seen him but he was then as to make up for this engaged in talk about him with miss gostrey
strether had kept away from home all day given himself up to the town and to his thoughts wandered and mused been at once restless and absorbedand all with the present climax of a rich little welcome in the quartier marboeuf
waymarsh has been 'unbeknown' to me i'm convincedfor miss gostrey had enquiredin communication with woollett the consequence of which was last night the loudest possible call for me
do you mean a letter to bring you home
noa cable which i have at this moment in my pocket a 'come back by the first ship'
strether's hostess it might have been made out just escaped changing colour
reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional serenity
it was perhaps exactly this that enabled her to say with duplicity and you're going
you almost deserve it when you abandon me so
she shook her head as if this were not worth taking up
my absence has helped youas i've only to look at you to see
it was my calculation and i'm justified
you're not where you were
and the thing she smiled was for me not to be there either
you can go of yourself
oh but i feel today he comfortably declared that i shall want you yet
she took him all in again
well i promise you not again to leave you but it will only be to follow you
you've got your momentum and can toddle alone
he intelligently accepted it
yesi suppose i can toddle
it's the sight of that in fact that has upset waymarsh
he can bear itthe way i strike him as goingno longer
that's only the climax of his original feeling
he wants me to quit and he must have written to woollett that i'm in peril of perdition
ah good
she murmured
but is it only your supposition
i make it outit explains
then he deniesor you haven't asked him
i've not had time strether said i made it out but last night putting various things together and i've not been since then face to face with him
she wondered
because you're too disgusted
you can't trust yourself
he settled his glasses on his nose
do i look in a great rage
you look divine
there's nothing he went on to be angry about
he has done me on the contrary a service
she made it out
by bringing things to a head
how well you understand
he almost groaned
waymarsh won't in the least at any rate when i have it out with him deny or extenuate
he has acted from the deepest conviction with the best conscience and after wakeful nights
he'll recognise that he's fully responsible and will consider that he has been highly successful so that any discussion we may have will bring us quite together againbridge the dark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart
we shall have at last in the consequences of his act something we can definitely talk about
she was silent a little
how wonderfully you take it
but you're always wonderful
he had a pause that matched her own then he had with an adequate spirit a complete admission
it's quite true
i'm extremely wonderful just now
i dare say in fact i'm quite fantastic and i shouldn't be at all surprised if i were mad
then tell me
she earnestly pressed
as he however for the time answered nothing only returning the look with which she watched him she presented herself where it was easier to meet her
what will mr waymarsh exactly have done
simply have written a letter
one will have been quite enough
he has told them i want looking after
and do you
she was all interest
immensely
and i shall get it
by which you mean you don't budge
i don't budge
you've cabled
noi've made chad do it
that you decline to come
that he declines
we had it out this morning and i brought him round
he had come in before i was down to tell me he was readyready i mean to return
and he went off after ten minutes with me to say he wouldn't
miss gostrey followed with intensity
then you've stopped him
strether settled himself afresh in his chair
i've stopped him
that is for the time
thathe gave it to her more vividlyis where i am
i see i see
but where's mr newsome
he was ready she asked to go
all ready
and sincerelybelieving you'd be
perfectly i think so that he was amazed to find the hand i had laid on him to pull him over suddenly converted into an engine for keeping him still
it was an account of the matter miss gostrey could weigh
does he think the conversion sudden
well said strether i'm not altogether sure what he thinks
i'm not sure of anything that concerns him except that the more i've seen of him the less i've found him what i originally expected
he's obscure and that's why i'm waiting
she wondered
but for what in particular
for the answer to his cable
and what was his cable
i don't know strether replied it was to be when he left me according to his own taste
i simply said to him 'i want to stay and the only way for me to do so is for you to'
that i wanted to stay seemed to interest him and he acted on that
miss gostrey turned it over
he wants then himself to stay
he half wants it
that is he half wants to go
my original appeal has to that extent worked in him
nevertheless strether pursued he won't go
not at least so long as i'm here
but you can't his companion suggested stay here always
i wish you could
by no means
still i want to see him a little further
he's not in the least the case i supposed he's quite another case
and it's as such that he interests me
it was almost as if for his own intelligence that deliberate and lucid our friend thus expressed the matter
i don't want to give him up
miss gostrey but desired to help his lucidity
she had however to be light and tactful
up you meanato his mother
well i'm not thinking of his mother now
i'm thinking of the plan of which i was the mouthpiece which as soon as we met i put before him as persuasively as i knew how and which was drawn up as it were in complete ignorance of all that in this last long period has been happening to him
it took no account whatever of the impression i was here on the spot immediately to begin to receive from himimpressions of which i feel sure i'm far from having had the last
miss gostrey had a smile of the most genial criticism
so your idea ismore or lessto stay out of curiosity
call it what you like
i don't care what it's called  so long as you do stay
certainly not then
i call it all the same immense fun maria gostrey declared and to see you work it out will be one of the sensations of my life
it is clear you can toddle alone
he received this tribute without elation
i shan't be alone when the pococks have come
her eyebrows went up
the pococks are coming
that i mean is what will happenand happen as quickly as possiblein consequence of chad's cable
they'll simply embark
sarah will come to speak for her motherwith an effect different from my muddle
miss gostrey more gravely wondered
she then will take him back
very possiblyand we shall see
she must at any rate have the chance and she may be trusted to do all she can
and do you want that
of course said strether i want it
i want to play fair
but she had lost for a moment the thread
if it devolves on the pococks why do you stay
just to see that i do play fairand a little also no doubt that they do
strether was luminous as he had never been
i came out to find myself in presence of new factsfacts that have kept striking me as less and less met by our old reasons
the matter's perfectly simple
new reasonsreasons as new as the facts themselvesare wanted and of this our friends at woollettchad's and minewere at the earliest moment definitely notified
if any are producible mrs pocock will produce them she'll bring over the whole collection
they'll be he added with a pensive smile a part of the 'fun' you speak of
she was quite in the current now and floating by his side
it's mamieso far as i've had it from youwho'll be their great card
and then as his contemplative silence wasn't a denial she significantly added i think i'm sorry for her
i think i am
and strether sprang up moving about a little as her eyes followed him
but it can't be helped
you mean her coming out can't be
he explained after another turn what he meant
the only way for her not to come is for me to go homeas i believe that on the spot i could prevent it
but the difficulty as to that is that if i do go home  i see i seeshe had easily understood
mr newsome will do the same and that's notshe laughed out nowto be thought of
strether had no laugh he had only a quiet comparatively placid look that might have shown him as proof against ridicule
strange isn't it
they had in the matter that so much interested them come so far as this without sounding another nameto which however their present momentary silence was full of a conscious reference
strether's question was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with him during the absence of his hostess and just for that reason a single gesture from her could pass for him as a vivid answer
yet he was answered still better when she said in a moment will mr newsome introduce his sister
to madame de vionnet
strether spoke the name at last
i shall be greatly surprised if he doesn't
she seemed to gaze at the possibility
you mean you've thought of it and you're prepared
i've thought of it and i'm prepared
it was to her visitor now that she applied her consideration
bon
you are magnificent
well he answered after a pause and a little wearily but still standing there before herwell that's what just once in all my dull days i think i shall like to have been
two days later he had news from chad of a communication from woollett in response to their determinant telegram this missive being addressed to chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for france of sarah and jim and mamie
strether had meanwhile on his own side cabled he had but delayed that act till after his visit to miss gostrey an interview by which as so often before he felt his sense of things cleared up and settled
his message to mrs newsome in answer to her own had consisted of the words judge best to take another month but with full appreciation of all reenforcements
he had added that he was writing but he was of course always writing it was a practice that continued oddly enough to relieve him to make him come nearer than anything else to the consciousness of doing something so that he often wondered if he hadn't really under his recent stress acquired some hollow trick one of the specious arts of makebelieve
wouldn't the pages he still so freely dispatched by the american post have been worthy of a showy journalist some master of the great new science of beating the sense out of words
wasn't he writing against time and mainly to show he was kindsince it had become quite his habit not to like to read himself over
on those lines he could still be liberal yet it was at best a sort of whistling in the dark
it was unmistakeable moreover that the sense of being in the dark now pressed on him more sharplycreating thereby the need for a louder and livelier whistle
he whistled long and hard after sending his message he whistled again and again in celebration of chad's news there was an interval of a fortnight in which this exercise helped him
he had no great notion of what on the spot sarah pocock would have to say though he had indeed confused premonitions but it shouldn't be in her power to sayit shouldn't be in any one's anywhere to saythat he was neglecting her mother
he might have written before more freely but he had never written more copiously and he frankly gave for a reason at woollett that he wished to fill the void created there by sarah's departure
the increase of his darkness however and the quickening as i have called it of his tune resided in the fact that he was hearing almost nothing
he had for some time been aware that he was hearing less than before and he was now clearly following a process by which mrs newsome's letters could but logically stop
he hadn't had a line for many days and he needed no proofthough he was in time to have plentythat she wouldn't have put pen to paper after receiving the hint that had determined her telegram
she wouldn't write till sarah should have seen him and reported on him
it was strange though it might well be less so than his own behaviour appeared at woollett
it was at any rate significant and what was remarkable was the way his friend's nature and manner put on for him through this very drop of demonstration a greater intensity
it struck him really that he had never so lived with her as during this period of her silence the silence was a sacred hush a finer clearer medium in which her idiosyncrasies showed
he walked about with her sat with her drove with her and dined facetoface with hera rare treat in his life as he could perhaps have scarce escaped phrasing it and if he had never seen her so soundless he had never on the other hand felt her so highly so almost austerely herself pure and by the vulgar estimate cold but deep devoted delicate sensitive noble
her vividness in these respects became for him in the special conditions almost an obsession and though the obsession sharpened his pulses adding really to the excitement of life there were hours at which to be less on the stretch he directly sought forgetfulness
he knew it for the queerest of adventuresa circumstance capable of playing such a part only for lambert stretherthat in paris itself of all places he should find this ghost of the lady of woollett more importunate than any other presence
when he went back to maria gostrey it was for the change to something else
and yet after all the change scarcely operated for he talked to her of mrs newsome in these days as he had never talked before
he had hitherto observed in that particular a discretion and a law considerations that at present broke down quite as if relations had altered
they hadn't really altered he said to himself so much as that came to for if what had occurred was of course that mrs newsome had ceased to trust him there was nothing on the other hand to prove that he shouldn't win back her confidence
it was quite his present theory that he would leave no stone unturned to do so and in fact if he now told maria things about her that he had never told before this was largely because it kept before him the idea of the honour of such a woman's esteem
his relation with maria as well was strangely enough no longer quite the same this truththough not too disconcertinglyhad come up between them on the renewal of their meetings
it was all contained in what she had then almost immediately said to him it was represented by the remark she had needed but ten minutes to make and that he hadn't been disposed to gainsay
he could toddle alone and the difference that showed was extraordinary
the turn taken by their talk had promptly confirmed this difference his larger confidence on the score of mrs newsome did the rest and the time seemed already far off when he had held out his small thirsty cup to the spout of her pail
her pail was scarce touched now and other fountains had flowed for him she fell into her place as but one of his tributaries and there was a strange sweetnessa melancholy mildness that touched himin her acceptance of the altered order
it marked for himself the flight of time or at any rate what he was pleased to think of with irony and pity as the rush of experience it having been but the day before yesterday that he sat at her feet and held on by her garment and was fed by her hand
it was the proportions that were changed and the proportions were at all times he philosophised the very conditions of perception the terms of thought
it was as if with her effective little entresol and and her wide acquaintance her activities varieties promiscuities the duties and devotions that took up nine tenths of her time and of which he got guardedly but the sidewindit was as if she had shrunk to a secondary element and had consented to the shrinkage with the perfection of tact
this perfection had never failed her it had originally been greater than his prime measure for it it had kept him quite apart kept him out of the shop as she called her huge general acquaintance made their commerce as quiet as much a thing of the home alonethe opposite of the shopas if she had never another customer
she had been wonderful to him at first with the memory of her little entresol the image to which on most mornings at that time his eyes directly opened but now she mainly figured for him as but part of the bristling totalthough of course always as a person to whom he should never cease to be indebted
it would never be given to him certainly to inspire a greater kindness
she had decked him out for others and he saw at this point at least nothing she would ever ask for
she only wondered and questioned and listened rendering him the homage of a wistful speculation
she expressed it repeatedly he was already far beyond her and she must prepare herself to lose him
there was but one little chance for her
often as she had said it he met itfor it was a touch he likedeach time the same way
my coming to grief
yesthen i might patch you up
oh for my real smash if it takes place there will be no patching
but you surely don't mean it will kill you
noworse
it will make me old
ah nothing can do that
the wonderful and special thing about you is that you are at this time of day youth
then she always made further one of those remarks that she had completely ceased to adorn with hesitations or apologies and that had by the same token in spite of their extreme straightness ceased to produce in strether the least embarrassment
she made him believe them and they became thereby as impersonal as truth itself
it's just your particular charm
his answer too was always the same
of course i'm youthyouth for the trip to europe
i began to be young or at least to get the benefit of it the moment i met you at chester and that's what has been taking place ever since
i never had the benefit at the proper timewhich comes to saying that i never had the thing itself
i'm having the benefit at this moment i had it the other day when i said to chad 'wait' i shall have it still again when sarah pocock arrives
it's a benefit that would make a poor show for many people and i don't know who else but you and i frankly could begin to see in it what i feel
i don't get drunk i don't pursue the ladies i don't spend money i don't even write sonnets
but nevertheless i'm making up late for what i didn't have early
i cultivate my little benefit in my own little way
it amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in all my life
they may say what they likeit's my surrender it's my tribute to youth
one puts that in where one canit has to come in somewhere if only out of the lives the conditions the feelings of other persons
chad gives me the sense of it for all his grey hairs which merely make it solid in him and safe and serene and she does the same for all her being older than he for all her marriageable daughter her separated husband her agitated history
though they're young enough my pair i don't say they're in the freshest way their own absolutely prime adolescence for that has nothing to do with it
the point is that they're mine
yes they're my youth since somehow at the right time nothing else ever was
what i meant just now therefore is that it would all gogo before doing its workif they were to fail me
on which just here miss gostrey inveterately questioned
what do you in particular call its work
well to see me through
but through what
she liked to get it all out of him
why through this experience
that was all that would come
it regularly gave her none the less the last word
don't you remember how in those first days of our meeting it was i who was to see you through
remember
tenderly deeplyhe always rose to it
you're just doing your part in letting me maunder to you thus
ah don't speak as if my part were small since whatever else fails you  you won't ever ever ever
he thus took her up
oh i beg your pardon you necessarily you inevitably will
your conditionsthat's what i meanwon't allow me anything to do for you
let alonei see what you meanthat i'm drearily dreadfully old
i am but there's a servicepossible for you to renderthat i know all the same i shall think of
and what will it be
this in fine however she would never tell him
you shall hear only if your smash takes place
as that's really out of the question i won't expose myselfa point at which for reasons of his own strether ceased to press
he came round for publicityit was the easiest thingto the idea that his smash was out of the question and this rendered idle the discussion of what might follow it
he attached an added importance as the days elapsed to the arrival of the pococks he had even a shameful sense of waiting for it insincerely and incorrectly
he accused himself of making believe to his own mind that sarah's presence her impression her judgement would simplify and harmonise he accused himself of being so afraid of what they might do that he sought refuge to beg the whole question in a vain fury
he had abundantly seen at home what they were in the habit of doing and he had not at present the smallest ground
his clearest vision was when he made out that what he most desired was an account more full and free of mrs newsome's state of mind than any he felt he could now expect from herself that calculation at least went hand in hand with the sharp consciousness of wishing to prove to himself that he was not afraid to look his behaviour in the face
if he was by an inexorable logic to pay for it he was literally impatient to know the cost and he held himself ready to pay in instalments
the first instalment would be precisely this entertainment of sarah as a consequence of which moreover he should know vastly better how he stood
book eighth     i   strether rambled alone during these few days the effect of the incident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked fashion his mixed relations with waymarsh
nothing had passed between them in reference to mrs newsome's summons but that our friend had mentioned to his own the departure of the deputation actually at seagiving him thus an opportunity to confess to the occult intervention he imputed to him
waymarsh however in the event confessed to nothing and though this falsified in some degree strether's forecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of good conscience out of which the dear man's impertinence had originally sprung
he was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe how unmistakeably he had put on flesh he felt his own holiday so successfully large and free that he was full of allowances and charities in respect to those cabined and confined' his instinct toward a spirit so strapped down as waymarsh's was to walk round it on tiptoe for fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time irretrievable
it was all very funny he knew and but the difference as he often said to himself of tweedledum and tweedledeean emancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the doormat on the scraper yet the present crisis was happily to profit by it and the pilgrim from milrose to know himself more than ever in the right
strether felt that when he heard of the approach of the pococks the impulse of pity quite sprang up in him beside the impulse of triumph
that was exactly why waymarsh had looked at him with eyes in which the heat of justice was measured and shaded
he had looked very hard as if affectionately sorry for the friendthe friend of fiftyfivewhose frivolity had had thus to be recorded becoming however but obscurely sententious and leaving his companion to formulate a charge
it was in this general attitude that he had of late altogether taken refuge with the drop of discussion they were solemnly sadly superficial strether recognised in him the mere portentous rumination to which miss barrace had so goodhumouredly described herself as assigning a corner of her salon
it was quite as if he knew his surreptitious step had been divined and it was also as if he missed the chance to explain the purity of his motive but this privation of relief should be precisely his small penance  it was not amiss for strether that he should find himself to that degree uneasy
if he had been challenged or accused rebuked for meddling or otherwise pulled up he would probably have shown on his own system all the height of his consistency all the depth of his good faith
explicit resentment of his course would have made him take the floor and the thump of his fist on the table would have affirmed him as consciously incorruptible
had what now really prevailed with strether been but a dread of that thumpa dread of wincing a little painfully at what it might invidiously demonstrate
however this might be at any rate one of the marks of the crisis was a visible a studied lapse in waymarsh of betrayed concern
as if to make up to his comrade for the stroke by which he had played providence he now conspicuously ignored his movements withdrew himself from the pretension to share them stiffened up his sensibility to neglect and clasping his large empty hands and swinging his large restless foot clearly looked to another quarter for justice
this made for independence on strether's part and he had in truth at no moment of his stay been so free to go and come
the early summer brushed the picture over and blurred everything but the near it made a vast warm fragrant medium in which the elements floated together on the best of terms in which rewards were immediate and reckonings postponed
chad was out of town again for the first time since his visitor's first view of him he had explained this necessitywithout detail yet also without embarrassment the circumstance was one of those which in the young man's life testified to the variety of his ties
strether wasn't otherwise concerned with it than for its so testifyinga pleasant multitudinous image in which he took comfort
he took comfort by the same stroke in the swing of chad's pendulum back from that other swing the sharp jerk towards woollett so stayed by his own hand
he had the entertainment of thinking that if he had for that moment stopped the clock it was to promote the next minute this still livelier motion
he himself did what he hadn't done before he took two or three times whole days offirrespective of others of two or three taken with miss gostrey two or three taken with little bilham  he went to chartres and cultivated before the front of the cathedral a general easy beatitude he went to fontainebleau and imagined himself on the way to italy he went to rouen with a little handbag and inordinately spent the night
one afternoon he did something quite different finding himself in the neighbourhood of a fine old house across the river he passed under the great arch of its doorway and asked at the porter's lodge for madame de vionnet
he had already hovered more than once about that possibility been aware of it in the course of ostensible strolls as lurking but round the corner
only it had perversely happened after his morning at notre dame that his consistency as he considered and intended it had come back to him whereby he had reflected that the encounter in question had been none of his making clinging again intensely to the strength of his position which was precisely that there was nothing in it for himself
from the moment he actively pursued the charming associate of his adventure from that moment his position weakened for he was then acting in an interested way
it was only within a few days that he had fixed himself a limit  he promised himself his consistency should end with sarah's arrival
it was arguing correctly to feel the title to a free hand conferred on him by this event
if he wasn't to be let alone he should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy
if he wasn't to be trusted he could at least take his ease
if he was to be placed under control he gained leave to try what his position might agreeably give him
an ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial till after the pococks had shown their spirit and it was to an ideal rigour that he had quite promised himself to conform
suddenly however on this particular day he felt a particular fear under which everything collapsed
he knew abruptly that he was afraid of himselfand yet not in relation to the effect on his sensibilities of another hour of madame de vionnet
what he dreaded was the effect of a single hour of sarah pocock as to whom he was visited in troubled nights with fantastic waking dreams
she loomed at him larger than life she increased in volume as she drew nearer she so met his eyes that his imagination taking after the first step all and more than all the strides he already felt her come down on him already burned under her reprobation with the blush of guilt already consented by way of penance to the instant forfeiture of everything
he saw himself under her direction recommitted to woollett as juvenile offenders are committed to reformatories
it wasn't of course that woollett was really a place of discipline but he knew in advance that sarah's salon at the hotel would be
his danger at any rate in such moods of alarm was some concession on this ground that would involve a sharp rupture with the actual therefore if he waited to take leave of that actual he might wholly miss his chance
it was represented with supreme vividness by madame de vionnet and that is why in a word he waited no longer
he had seen in a flash that he must anticipate mrs pocock
he was accordingly much disappointed on now learning from the portress that the lady of his quest was not in paris
she had gone for some days to the country
there was nothing in this accident but what was natural yet it produced for poor strether a drop of all confidence
it was suddenly as if he should never see her again and as if moreover he had brought it on himself by not having been quite kind to her
it was the advantage of his having let his fancy lose itself for a little in the gloom that as by reaction the prospect began really to brighten from the moment the deputation from woollett alighted on the platform of the station
they had come straight from havre having sailed from new york to that port and having also thanks to a happy voyage made land with a promptitude that left chad newsome who had meant to meet them at the dock belated
he had received their telegram with the announcement of their immediate further advance just as he was taking the train for havre so that nothing had remained for him but to await them in paris
he hastily picked up strether at the hotel for this purpose and he even with easy pleasantry suggested the attendance of waymarsh as wellwaymarsh at the moment his cab rattled up being engaged under strether's contemplative range in a grave perambulation of the familiar court
waymarsh had learned from his companion who had already had a note delivered by hand from chad that the pococks were due and had ambiguously though as always impressively glowered at him over the circumstance carrying himself in a manner in which strether was now expert enough to recognise his uncertainty in the premises as to the best tone
the only tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tonewhich was necessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge
the pococks were a quantity as yet unmeasured and as he had practically brought them over so this witness had to that extent exposed himself
he wanted to feel right about it but could only at the best for the time feel vague
i shall look to you you know immensely our friend had said to help me with them and he had been quite conscious of the effect of the remark and of others of the same sort on his comrade's sombre sensibility
he had insisted on the fact that waymarsh would quite like mrs pocockone could be certain he would he would be with her about everything and she would also be with him and miss barrace's nose in short would find itself out of joint
strether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the court for chad he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet while caged and leonine his fellow traveller paced and turned before him
chad newsome was doubtless to be struck when he arrived with the sharpness of their opposition at this particular hour he was to remember as a part of it how waymarsh came with him and with strether to the street and stood there with a face halfwistful and halfrueful
they talked of him the two others as they drove and strether put chad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things
he had already a few days before named to him the wire he was convinced their friend had pulleda confidence that had made on the young man's part quite hugely for curiosity and diversion
the action of the matter moreover strether could see was to penetrate he saw that is how chad judged a system of influence in which waymarsh had served as a determinantan impression just now quickened again with the whole bearing of such a fact on the youth's view of his relatives
as it came up between them that they might now take their friend for a feature of the control of these latter now sought to be exerted from woollett strether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him half an hour later for sarah pocock's eyes that he was as much on chad's side as waymarsh had probably described him
he was letting himself at present go there was no denying it it might be desperation it might be confidence he should offer himself to the arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated
he repeated to chad what he had been saying in the court to waymarsh how there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a kindred spirit no doubt of the alliance based on an exchange of views that the pair would successfully strike up
they would become as thick as thieveswhich moreover was but a development of what strether remembered to have said in one of his first discussions with his mate struck as he had then already been with the elements of affinity between that personage and mrs newsome herself
i told him one day when he had questioned me on your mother that she was a person who when he should know her would rouse in him i was sure a special enthusiasm and that hangs together with the conviction we now feelthis certitude that mrs pocock will take him into her boat
for it's your mother's own boat that she's pulling
ah said chad mother's worth fifty of sally
a thousand but when you presently meet her all the same you'll be meeting your mother's representativejust as i shall
i feel like the outgoing ambassador said strether doing honour to his appointed successor
a moment after speaking as he had just done he felt he had inadvertently rather cheapened mrs newsome to her son an impression audibly reflected as at first seen in chad's prompt protest
he had recently rather failed of apprehension of the young man's attitude and temperremaining principally conscious of how little worry at the worst he wasted and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed interest
chad had done exactly what he had promised him a fortnight previoushad accepted without another question his plea for delay
he was waiting cheerfully and handsomely but also inscrutably and with a slight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his acquired high polish
he was neither excited nor depressed was easy and acute and deliberateunhurried unflurried unworried only at most a little less amused than usual
strether felt him more than ever a justification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd spirit had been the arena he knew as their cab rolled along knew as he hadn't even yet known that nothing else than what chad had done and had been would have led to his present showing
they had made him these things what he was and the business hadn't been easy it had taken time and trouble it had cost above all a price
the result at any rate was now to be offered to sally which strether so far as that was concerned was glad to be there to witness
would she in the least make it out or take it in the result or would she in the least care for it if she did
he scratched his chin as he asked himself by what name when challengedas he was sure he should behe could call it for her
oh those were determinations she must herself arrive at since she wanted so much to see let her see then and welcome
she had come out in the pride of her competence yet it hummed in strether's inner sense that she practically wouldn't see
that this was moreover what chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a word that next dropped from him
they're children they play at life
and the exclamation was significant and reassuring
it implied that he hadn't then for his companion's sensibility appeared to give mrs newsome away and it facilitated our friend's presently asking him if it were his idea that mrs pocock and madame de vionnet should become acquainted
strether was still more sharply struck hereupon with chad's lucidity
why isn't that exactlyto get a sight of the company i keepwhat she has come out for
yesi'm afraid it is strether unguardedly replied
chad's quick rejoinder lighted his precipitation
why do you say you're afraid
well because i feel a certain responsibility
it's my testimony i imagine that will have been at the bottom of mrs pocock's curiosity
my letters as i've supposed you to understand from the beginning have spoken freely
i've certainly said my little say about madame de vionnet
all that for chad was beautifully obvious
yes but you've only spoken handsomely
never more handsomely of any woman
but it's just that tone
that tone said chad that has fetched her
i dare say but i've no quarrel with you about it
and no more has madame de vionnet
don't you know by this time how she likes you
oh
and strether had with his groan a real pang of melancholy
for all i've done for her
ah you've done a great deal
chad's urbanity fairly shamed him and he was at this moment absolutely impatient to see the face sarah pocock would present to a sort of thing as he synthetically phrased it to himself with no adequate forecast of which despite his admonitions she would certainly arrive
i've done this
well this is all right
she likes chad comfortably remarked  to be liked
it gave his companion a moment's thought
and she's sure mrs pocock will
no i say that for you
she likes your liking her it's so much as it were chad laughed to the good
however she doesn't despair of sarah either and is prepared on her own side to go all lengths
in the way of appreciation
yes and of everything else
in the way of general amiability hospitality and welcome
she's under arms chad laughed again she's prepared
strether took it in then as if an echo of miss barrace were in the air  she's wonderful
you don't begin to know how wonderful
there was a depth in it to strether's ear of confirmed luxuryalmost a kind of unconscious insolence of proprietorship but the effect of the glimpse was not at this moment to foster speculation there was something so conclusive in so much graceful and generous assurance
it was in fact a fresh evocation and the evocation had before many minutes another consequence
well i shall see her oftener now
i shall see her as much as i likeby your leave which is what i hitherto haven't done
it has been said chad but without reproach only your own fault
i tried to bring you together and she my dear fellowi never saw her more charming to any man
but you've got your extraordinary ideas
well i did have strether murmured while he felt both how they had possessed him and how they had now lost their authority
he couldn't have traced the sequence to the end but it was all because of mrs pocock
mrs pocock might be because of mrs newsome but that was still to be proved
what came over him was the sense of having stupidly failed to profit where profit would have been precious
it had been open to him to see so much more of her and he had but let the good days pass
fierce in him almost was the resolve to lose no more of them and he whimsically reflected while at chad's side he drew nearer to his destination that it was after all sarah who would have quickened his chance
what her visit of inquisition might achieve in other directions was as yet all obscureonly not obscure that it would do supremely much to bring two earnest persons together
he had but to listen to chad at this moment to feel it for chad was in the act of remarking to him that they of course both counted on himhe himself and the other earnest personfor cheer and support
it was brave to strether to hear him talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out was to make things ravishing to the pococks
no if madame de vionnet compassed that compassed the ravishment of the pococks madame de vionnet would be prodigious
it would be a beautiful plan if it succeeded and it all came to the question of sarah's being really bribeable
the precedent of his own case helped strether perhaps but little to consider she might prove so it being distinct that her character would rather make for every possible difference
this idea of his own bribeability set him apart for himself with the further mark in fact that his case was absolutely proved
he liked always where lambert strether was concerned to know the worst and what he now seemed to know was not only that he was bribeable but that he had been effectually bribed
the only difficulty was that he couldn't quite have said with what
it was as if he had sold himself but hadn't somehow got the cash
that however was what characteristically would happen to him
it would naturally be his kind of traffic
while he thought of these things he reminded chad of the truth they mustn't lose sight ofthe truth that with all deference to her susceptibility to new interests sarah would have come out with a high firm definite purpose
she hasn't come out you know to be bamboozled
we may all be ravishingnothing perhaps can be more easy for us but she hasn't come out to be ravished
she has come out just simply to take you home
oh well with her i'll go said chad goodhumouredly
i suppose you'll allow that
and then as for a minute strether said nothing or is your idea that when i've seen her i shan't want to go
as this question however again left his friend silent he presently went on my own idea at any rate is that they shall have while they're here the best sort of time
it was at this that strether spoke
ah there you are
i think if you really wanted to go
well
said chad to bring it out
well you wouldn't trouble about our good time
you wouldn't care what sort of a time we have
chad could always take in the easiest way in the world any ingenious suggestion
i see
but can i help it
i'm too decent
yes you're too decent
strether heavily sighed
and he felt for the moment as if it were the preposterous end of his mission
it ministered for the time to this temporary effect that chad made no rejoinder
but he spoke again as they came in sight of the station
do you mean to introduce her to miss gostrey
as to this strether was ready
no
but haven't you told me they know about her
i think i've told you your mother knows
and won't she have told sally
that's one of the things i want to see
and if you find she has
will i then you mean bring them together
yes said chad with his pleasant promptness  to show her there's nothing in it
strether hesitated
i don't know that i care very much what she may think there's in it
not if it represents what mother thinks
ah what does your mother think
there was in this some sound of bewilderment
but they were just driving up and help of a sort might after all be quite at hand
isn't that my dear man what we're both just going to make out
ii   strether quitted the station half an hour later in different company
chad had taken charge for the journey to the hotel of sarah mamie the maid and the luggage all spaciously installed and conveyed and it was only after the four had rolled away that his companion got into a cab with jim
a strange new feeling had come over strether in consequence of which his spirits had risen it was as if what had occurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than his fear though his fear had vet not been of an instant scene of violence
his impression had been nothing but what was inevitablehe said that to himself yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped upon him
nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things to the look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him to satiety as he might have said for years but he now knew all the same how uneasy he had felt that was brought home to him by his present sense of a respite
it had come moreover in the flash of an eye it had come in the smile with which sarah whom at the window of her compartment they had effusively greeted from the platform rustled down to them a moment later fresh and handsome from her cool june progress through the charming land
it was only a sign but enough she was going to be gracious and unallusive she was going to play the larger gamewhich was still more apparent after she had emerged from chad's arms in her direct greeting to the valued friend of her family
strether was then as much as ever the valued friend of her family it was something he could at all events go on with and the manner of his response to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the prospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness
he had always seen sarah gracioushad in fact rarely seen her shy or dry her marked thinlipped smile intense without brightness and as prompt to act as the scrape of a safetymatch the protrusion of her rather remarkably long chin which in her case represented invitation and urbanity and not as in most others pugnacity and defiance the penetration of her voice to a distance the general encouragement and approval of her manner were all elements with which intercourse had made him familiar but which he noted today almost as if she had been a new acquaintance
this first glimpse of her had given a brief but vivid accent to her resemblance to her mother he could have taken her for mrs newsome while she met his eyes as the train rolled into the station
it was an impression that quickly dropped mrs newsome was much handsomer and while sarah inclined to the massive her mother had at an age still the girdle of a maid also the latter's chin was rather short than long and her smile by good fortune much more oh ever so much more mercifully vague
strether had seen mrs newsome reserved he had literally heard her silent though he had never known her unpleasant
it was the case with mrs pocock that he had known her unpleasant even though he had never known her not affable
she had forms of affability that were in a high degree assertive nothing for instance had ever been more striking than that she was affable to jim
what had told in any case at the window of the train was her high clear forehead that forehead which her friends for some reason always thought of as a brow the long reach of her eyesit came out at this juncture in such a manner as to remind him oddly enough also of that of waymarsh's and the unusual gloss of her dark hair dressed and hatted after her mother's refined example with such an avoidance of extremes that it was always spoken of at woollett as their own
though this analogy dropped as soon as she was on the platform it had lasted long enough to make him feel all the advantage as it were of his relief
the woman at home the woman to whom he was attached was before him just long enough to give him again the measure of the wretchedness in fact really of the shame of their having to recognise the formation between them of a split
he had taken this measure in solitude and meditation  but the catastrophe as sarah steamed up looked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadfulor proved more exactly altogether unthinkable so that his finding something free and familiar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his loyalty
he had suddenly sounded the whole depth had gasped at what he might have lost
well he could now for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover about the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him was that he had lost nothing
he wasn't going to have sarah write to her mother that night that he was in any way altered or strange
there had been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was strange that he was altered in every way but that was a matter for himself he knew at least whose business it was not it was not at all events such a circumstance as sarah's own unaided lights would help her to
even if she had come out to flash those lights more than yet appeared she wouldn't make much headway against mere pleasantness
he counted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end and if only from incapacity moreover to formulate anything different
he couldn't even formulate to himself his being changed and queer it had taken place the process somewhere deep down maria gostrey had caught glimpses of it but how was he to fish it up even if he desired for mrs pocock
this was then the spirit in which he hovered and with the easier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high and established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by mamie
he had wondered vaguelyturning over many things in the fidget of his thoughtsif mamie were as pretty as woollett published her as to which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by woollett's opinion that this consequence really let loose for the imagination an avalanche of others
there were positively five minutes in which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a woollett represented by a mamie
this was the sort of truth the place itself would feel it would send her forth in confidence it would point to her with triumph it would take its stand on her with assurance it would be conscious of no requirements she didn't meet of no question she couldn't answer
well it was right strether slipped smoothly enough into the cheerfulness of saying  granted that a community might be best represented by a young lady of twentytwo mamie perfectly played the part played it as if she were used to it and looked and spoke and dressed the character
he wondered if she mightn't in the high light of paris a cool full studiolight becoming yet treacherous show as too conscious of these matters but the next moment he felt satisfied that her consciousness was after all empty for its size rather too simple than too mixed and that the kind way with her would be not to take many things out of it but to put as many as possible in
she was robust and conveniently tall just a trifle too bloodlessly fair perhaps but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her vitality
she might have been receiving for woollett wherever she found herself and there was something in her manner her tone her motion her pretty blue eyes her pretty perfect teeth and her very small too small nose that immediately placed her to the fancy between the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were highup at that end to which people were brought to be presented
they were there to congratulate these images and strether's renewed vision on this hint completed the idea
what mamie was like was the happy bride the bride after the church and just before going away
she wasn't the mere maiden and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to
she was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage
well might it last her long
strether rejoiced in these things for chad who was all genial attention to the needs of his friends besides having arranged that his servant should reinforce him the ladies were certainly pleasant to see and mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit
she would look extraordinarily like his young wifethe wife of a honeymoon should he go about with her but that was his own affairor perhaps it was hers it was at any rate something she couldn't help
strether remembered how he had seen him come up with jeanne de vionnet in gloriani's garden and the fancy he had had about thatthe fancy obscured now thickly overlaid with others the recollection was during these minutes his only note of trouble
he had often in spite of himself wondered if chad but too probably were not with jeanne the object of a still and shaded flame
it was on the cards that the child might be tremulously in love and this conviction now flickered up not a bit the less for his disliking to think of it for its being in a complicated situation a complication the more and for something indescribable in mamie something at all events straightway lent her by his own mind something that gave her value gave her intensity and purpose as the symbol of an opposition
little jeanne wasn't really at all in questionhow could she beyet from the moment miss pocock had shaken her skirts on the platform touched up the immense bows of her hat and settled properly over her shoulder the strap of her moroccoandgilt travellingsatchel from that moment little jeanne was opposed
it was in the cab with jim that impressions really crowded on strether giving him the strangest sense of length of absence from people among whom he had lived for years
having them thus come out to him was as if he had returned to find them  and the droll promptitude of jim's mental reaction threw his own initiation far back into the past
whoever might or mightn't be suited by what was going on among them jim for one would certainly be  his instant recognitionfrank and whimsicalof what the affair was for him gave strether a glow of pleasure
i say you know this is about my shape and if it hadn't been for you
so he broke out as the charming streets met his healthy appetite and he wound up after an expressive nudge with a clap of his companion's knee and an oh you youyou are doing it
that was charged with rich meaning
strether felt in it the intention of homage but with a curiosity otherwise occupied postponed taking it up
what he was asking himself for the time was how sarah pocock in the opportunity already given her had judged her brotherfrom whom he himself as they finally at the station separated for their different conveyances had had a look into which he could read more than one message
however sarah was judging her brother chad's conclusion about his sister and about her husband and her husband's sister was at the least on the way not to fail of confidence
strether felt the confidence and that as the look between them was an exchange what he himself gave back was relatively vague
this comparison of notes however could wait everything struck him as depending on the effect produced by chad
neither sarah nor mamie had in any way at the stationwhere they had had after all ample timebroken out about it which to make up for this was what our friend had expected of jim as soon as they should find themselves together
it was queer to him that he had that noiseless brush with chad an ironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his relatives an intelligence carried on under their nose and as might be said at their expensesuch a matter marked again for him strongly the number of stages he had come albeit that if the number seemed great the time taken for the final one was but the turn of a hand
he had before this had many moments of wondering if he himself weren't perhaps changed even as chad was changed
only what in chad was conspicuous improvementwell he had no name ready for the working in his own organism of his own more timid dose
he should have to see first what this action would amount to
and for his occult passage with the young man after all the directness of it had no greater oddity than the fact that the young man's way with the three travellers should have been so happy a manifestation
strether liked him for it on the spot as he hadn't yet liked him it affected him while it lasted as he might have been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art  to that degree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it took it in and did it justice to that degree that it would have been scarce a miracle if there in the luggageroom while they waited for their things sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside
you're right we haven't quite known what you mean mother and i but now we see
chad's magnificent what can one want more
if this is the kind of thing
on which they might as it were have embraced and begun to work together
ah how much as it was for all her bridling brightnesswhich was merely general and noticed nothingwould they work together
strether knew he was unreasonable he set it down to his being nervous  people couldn't notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an hour
possibly no doubt also he made too much of chad's display
yet none the less when at the end of five minutes in the cab jim pocock had said nothing eitherhadn't said that is what strether wanted though he had said much elseit all suddenly bounced back to their being either stupid or wilful
it was more probably on the whole the former so that that would be the drawback of the bridling brightness
yes they would bridle and be bright they would make the best of what was before them but their observation would fail it would be beyond them they simply wouldn't understand
of what use would it be then that they had comeif they weren't to be intelligent up to that point unless indeed he himself were utterly deluded and extravagant
was he on this question of chad's improvement fantastic and away from the truth
did he live in a false world a world that had grown simply to suit him and was his present slight irritationin the face now of jim's silence in particularbut the alarm of the vain thing menaced by the touch of the real
was this contribution of the real possibly the mission of the pocockshad they come to make the work of observation as he had practised observation crack and crumble and to reduce chad to the plain terms in which honest minds could deal with him
had they come in short to be sane where strether was destined to feel that he himself had only been silly
he glanced at such a contingency but it failed to hold him long when once he had reflected that he would have been silly in this case with maria gostrey and little bilham with madame de vionnet and little jeanne with lambert strether in fine and above all with chad newsome himself
wouldn't it be found to have made more for reality to be silly with these persons than sane with sarah and jim
jim in fact he presently made up his mind was individually out of it jim didn't care jim hadn't come out either for chad or for him jim in short left the moral side to sally and indeed simply availed himself now for the sense of recreation of the fact that he left almost everything to sally
he was nothing compared to sally and not so much by reason of sally's temper and will as by that of her more developed type and greater acquaintance with the world
he quite frankly and serenely confessed as he sat there with strether that he felt his type hang far in the rear of his wife's and still further if possible in the rear of his sister's
their types he well knew were recognised and acclaimed whereas the most a leading woollett businessman could hope to achieve socially and for that matter industrially was a certain freedom to play into this general glamour
the impression he made on our friend was another of the things that marked our friend's road
it was a strange impression especially as so soon produced strether had received it he judged all in the twenty minutes it struck him at least as but in a minor degree the work of the long woollett years
pocock was normally and consentingly though not quite wittingly out of the question
it was despite his being normal it was despite his being cheerful it was despite his being a leading woollett businessman and the determination of his fate left him thus perfectly usualas everything else about it was clearly to his sense not less so
he seemed to say that there was a whole side of life on which the perfectly usual was for leading woollett businessmen to be out of the question
he made no more of it than that and strether so far as jim was concerned desired to make no more
only strether's imagination as always worked and he asked himself if this side of life were not somehow connected for those who figured on it with the fact of marriage
would his relation to it had he married ten years before have become now the same as pocock's
might it even become the same should he marry in a few months
should he ever know himself as much out of the question for mrs newsome as jim knew himselfin a dim wayfor mrs jim
to turn his eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured he was different from pocock he had affirmed himself differently and was held after all in higher esteem
what none the less came home to him however at this hour was that the society over there that of which sarah and mamieand in a more eminent way mrs newsome herselfwere specimens was essentially a society of women and that poor jim wasn't in it
he himself lambert strether was as yet in some degreewhich was an odd situation for a man but it kept coming back to him in a whimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his place
this occasion indeed whatever that fancy represented was not a time of sensible exclusion for jim who was in a state of manifest response to the charm of his adventure
small and fat and constantly facetious strawcoloured and destitute of marks he would have been practically indistinguishable hadn't his constant preference for lightgrey clothes for white hats for very big cigars and very little stories done what it could for his identity
there were signs in him though none of them plaintive of always paying for others and the principal one perhaps was just this failure of type
it was with this that he paid rather than with fatigue or waste and also doubtless a little with the effort of humournever irrelevant to the conditions to the relations with which he was acquainted
he gurgled his joy as they rolled through the happy streets he declared that his trip was a regular windfall and that he wasn't there he was eager to remark to hang back from anything  he didn't know quite what sally had come for but he had come for a good time
strether indulged him even while wondering if what sally wanted her brother to go back for was to become like her husband
he trusted that a good time was to be out and out the programme for all of them and he assented liberally to jim's proposal that disencumbered and irresponsiblehis things were in the omnibus with those of the othersthey should take a further turn round before going to the hotel
it wasn't for him to tackle chadit was sally's job and as it would be like her he felt to open fire on the spot it wouldn't be amiss of them to hold off and give her time
strether on his side only asked to give her time so he jogged with his companion along boulevards and avenues trying to extract from meagre material some forecast of his catastrophe
he was quick enough to see that jim pocock declined judgement had hovered quite round the outer edge of discussion and anxiety leaving all analysis of their question to the ladies alone and now only feeling his way toward some small droll cynicism
it broke out afresh the cynicismit had already shown a flickerin a but slightly deferred  well hanged if i would if i were he
you mean you wouldn't in chad's place
give up this to go back and boss the advertising
poor jim with his arms folded and his little legs out in the open fiacre drank in the sparkling paris noon and carried his eyes from one side of their vista to the other
why i want to come right out and live here myself
and i want to live while i am here too
i feel with youoh you've been grand old man and i've twiggedthat it ain't right to worry chad
i don't mean to persecute him i couldn't in conscience
it's thanks to you at any rate that i'm here and i'm sure i'm much obliged
you're a lovely pair
there were things in this speech that strether let pass for the time
don't you then think it important the advertising should be thoroughly taken in hand
chad will be so far as capacity is concerned he went on the man to do it
where did he get his capacity jim asked over here
he didn't get it over here and the wonderful thing is that over here he hasn't inevitably lost it
he has a natural turn for business an extraordinary head
he comes by that strether explained honestly enough
he's in that respect his father's son and alsofor she's wonderful in her way toohis mother's
he has other tastes and other tendencies but mrs newsome and your wife are quite right about his having that
he's very remarkable
well i guess he is
jim pocock comfortably sighed
but if you've believed so in his making us hum why have you so prolonged the discussion
don't you know we've been quite anxious about you
these questions were not informed with earnestness but strether saw he must none the less make a choice and take a line
because you see i've greatly liked it
i've liked my paris i dare say i've liked it too much
oh you old wretch
jim gaily exclaimed
but nothing's concluded strether went on
the case is more complex than it looks from woollett
oh well it looks bad enough from woollett
jim declared
even after all i've written
jim bethought himself
isn't it what you've written that has made mrs newsome pack us off
that at least and chad's not turning up
strether made a reflexion of his own
i see
that she should do something was no doubt inevitable and your wife has therefore of course come out to act
oh yes jim concurredto act
but sally comes out to act you know he lucidly added every time she leaves the house
she never comes out but she does act
she's acting moreover now for her mother and that fixes the scale
then he wound up opening all his senses to it with a renewed embrace of pleasant paris
we haven't all the same at woollett got anything like this
strether continued to consider
i'm bound to say for you all that you strike me as having arrived in a very mild and reasonable frame of mind
you don't show your claws
i felt just now in mrs pocock no symptom of that
she isn't fierce he went on
i'm such a nervous idiot that i thought she might be
oh don't you know her well enough pocock asked to have noticed that she never gives herself away any more than her mother ever does
they ain't fierce either of 'em they let you come quite close
they wear their fur the smooth side outthe warm side in
do you know what they are
jim pursued as he looked about him giving the question as strether felt but half his caredo you know what they are
they're about as intense as they can live
yesand strether's concurrence had a positive precipitation they're about as intense as they can live
they don't lash about and shake the cage said jim who seemed pleased with his analogy and it's at feedingtime that they're quietest
but they always get there
they do indeedthey always get there
strether replied with a laugh that justified his confession of nervousness
he disliked to be talking sincerely of mrs  newsome with pocock he could have talked insincerely
but there was something he wanted to know a need created in him by her recent intermission by his having given from the first so much as now more than ever appeared to him and got so little
it was as if a queer truth in his companion's metaphor had rolled over him with a rush
she had been quiet at feedingtime she had fed and sarah had fed with her out of the big bowl of all his recent free communication his vividness and pleasantness his ingenuity and even his eloquence while the current of her response had steadily run thin
jim meanwhile however it was true slipped characteristically into shallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of a husband
but of course chad has now the advantage of being there before her
if he doesn't work that for all it's worth
he sighed with contingent pity at his brotherinlaw's possible want of resource
he has worked it on you pretty well eh
and he asked the next moment if there were anything new at the varieties which he pronounced in the american manner
they talked about the varietiesstrether confessing to a knowledge which produced again on pocock's part a play of innuendo as vague as a nurseryrhyme yet as aggressive as an elbow in his side and they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes
strether waited to the end but still in vain for any show that jim had seen chad as different  and he could scarce have explained the discouragement he drew from the absence of this testimony
it was what he had taken his own stand on  so far as he had taken a stand and if they were all only going to see nothing he had only wasted his time
he gave his friend till the very last moment till they had come into sight of the hotel and when poor pocock only continued cheerful and envious and funny he fairly grew to dislike him to feel him extravagantly common
if they were all going to see nothingstrether knew  as this came back to him that he was also letting pocock represent for him what mrs newsome wouldn't see
he went on disliking in the light of jim's commonness to talk to him about that lady yet just before the cab pulled up he knew the extent of his desire for the real word from woollett
has mrs newsome at all given way
'given way'
jim echoed it with the practical derision of his sense of a long past
under the strain i mean of hope deferred of disappointment repeated and thereby intensified
oh is she prostrate you mean
he had his categories in hand
why yes she's prostratejust as sally is
but they're never so lively you know as when they're prostrate
ah sarah's prostrate
strether vaguely murmured
it's when they're prostrate that they most sit up
and mrs newsome's sitting up
all night my boyfor you
and jim fetched him  with a vulgar little guffaw a thrust that gave relief to the picture
but he had got what he wanted
he felt on the spot that this was the real word from woollett
so don't you go home
jim added while he alighted and while his friend letting him profusely pay the cabman  sat on in a momentary muse
strether wondered if that were the real word too
iii   as the door of mrs pocock's salon was pushed open for him the next day well before noon he was reached by a voice with a charming sound that made him just falter before crossing the threshold
madame de vionnet was already on the field and this gave the drama a quicker pace than he felt it as yetthough his suspense had increasedin the power of any act of his own to do
he had spent the previous evening with all his old friends together yet he would still have described himself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their influence on his situation
it was strange now none the less that in the light of this unexpected note of her presence he felt madame de vionnet a part of that situation as she hadn't even yet been
she was alone he found himself assuming with sarah and there was a bearing in thatsomehow beyond his controlon his personal fate
yet she was only saying something quite easy and independentthe thing she had come as a good friend of chad's on purpose to say
there isn't anything at all
i should be so delighted
it was clear enough when they were there before him how she had been received
he saw this as sarah got up to greet him from something fairly hectic in sarah's face
he saw furthermore that they weren't as had first come to him alone together he was at no loss as to the identity of the broad high back presented to him in the embrasure of the window furthest from the door
waymarsh whom he had today not yet seen  whom he only knew to have left the hotel before him  and who had taken part the night previous on mrs  pocock's kind invitation conveyed by chad in the entertainment informal but cordial promptly offered by that ladywaymarsh had anticipated him even as madame de vionnet had done and with his hands in his pockets and his attitude unaffected by strether's entrance was looking out in marked detachment at the rue de rivoli
the latter felt it in the airit was immense how waymarsh could mark thingsthat he had remained deeply dissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have recorded on madame de vionnet's side
he had conspicuously tact besides a stiff general view and this was why he had left mrs pocock to struggle alone
he would outstay the visitor he would unmistakeably wait to what had he been doomed for months past but waiting
therefore she was to feel that she had him in reserve
what support she drew from this was still to be seen for although sarah was vividly bright she had given herself up for the moment to an ambiguous flushed formalism
she had had to reckon more quickly than she expected but it concerned her first of all to signify that she was not to be taken unawares
strether arrived precisely in time for her showing it
oh you're too good but i don't think i feel quite helpless
i have my brotherand these american friends
and then you know i've been to paris
i know paris said sally pocock in a tone that breathed a certain chill on strether's heart
ah but a woman in this tiresome place where everything's always changing a woman of good will madame de vionnet threw off can always help a woman
i'm sure you 'know'but we know perhaps different things
she too visibly wished to make no mistake but it was a fear of a different order and more kept out of sight
she smiled in welcome at strether she greeted him more familiarly than mrs pocock she put out her hand to him without moving from her place and it came to him in the course of a minute and in the oddest way thatyes positivelyshe was giving him over to ruin
she was all kindness and ease but she couldn't help so giving him she was exquisite and her being just as she was poured for sarah a sudden rush of meaning into his own equivocations
how could she know how she was hurting him
she wanted to show as simple and humblein the degree compatible with operative charm but it was just this that seemed to put him on her side
she struck him as dressed as arranged as prepared infinitely to conciliatewith the very poetry of good taste in her view of the conditions of her early call
she was ready to advise about dressmakers and shops she held herself wholly at the disposition of chad's family
strether noticed her card on the tableher coronet and her comtesseand the imagination was sharp in him of certain private adjustments in sarah's mind
she had never he was sure sat with a comtesse before and such was the specimen of that class he had been keeping to play on her
she had crossed the sea very particularly for a look at her but he read in madame de vionnet's own eyes that this curiosity hadn't been so successfully met as that she herself wouldn't now have more than ever need of him
she looked much as she had looked to him that morning at notre dame he noted in fact the suggestive sameness of her discreet and delicate dress
it seemed to speakperhaps a little prematurely or too finelyof the sense in which she would help mrs pocock with the shops
the way that lady took her in moreover added depth to his impression of what miss gostrey by their common wisdom had escaped
he winced as he saw himself but for that timely prudence ushering in maria as a guide and an example
there was however a touch of relief for him in his glimpse so far as he had got it of sarah's line
she knew paris
madame de vionnet had for that matter lightly taken this up
ah then you've a turn for that an affinity that belongs to your family
your brother though his long experience makes a difference i admit has become one of us in a marvellous way
and she appealed to strether in the manner of a woman who could always glide off with smoothness into another subject
wasn't he struck with the way mr newsome had made the place his own and hadn't he been in a position to profit by his friend's wondrous expertness
strether felt the bravery at the least of her presenting herself so promptly to sound that note and yet asked himself what other note after all she could strike from the moment she presented herself at all
she could meet mrs pocock only on the ground of the obvious and what feature of chad's situation was more eminent than the fact that he had created for himself a new set of circumstances
unless she hid herself altogether she could show but as one of these an illustration of his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition
and the consciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine that as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him such a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as pusillanimous
ah don't be so charming to mefor it makes us intimate and after all what is between us when i've been so tremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times
he recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his poor personal aspects  it would be exactly like the way things always turned out for him that he should affect mrs pocock and waymarsh as launched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at all
they were at this very momentthey could only beattributing to him the full licence of it and all by the operation of her own tone with him whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to the brink not to dip so much as a toe into the flood
but the flicker of his fear on this occasion was not as may be added to repeat itself it sprang up for its moment only to die down and then go out for ever
to meet his fellow visitor's invocation and with sarah's brilliant eyes on him answer was quite sufficiently to step into her boat
during the rest of the time her visit lasted he felt himself proceed to each of the proper offices successively for helping to keep the adventurous skiff afloat
it rocked beneath him but he settled himself in his place
he took up an oar and since he was to have the credit of pulling pulled
that will make it all the pleasanter if it so happens that we do meet madame de vionnet had further observed in reference to mrs pocock's mention of her initiated state and she had immediately added that after all her hostess couldn't be in need with the good offices of mr strether so close at hand
it's he i gather who has learnt to know his paris and to love it better than any one ever before in so short a time so that between him and your brother when it comes to the point how can you possibly want for good guidance
the great thing mr strether will show you she smiled is just to let one's self go
oh i've not let myself go very far strether answered feeling quite as if he had been called upon to hint to mrs pocock how parisians could talk
i'm only afraid of showing i haven't let myself go far enough
i've taken a good deal of time but i must quite have had the air of not budging from one spot
he looked at sarah in a manner that he thought she might take as engaging and he made under madame de vionnet's protection as it were his first personal point
what has really happened has been that all the while i've done what i came out for
yet it only at first gave madame de vionnet a chance immediately to take him up
you've renewed acquaintance with your friendyou've learnt to know him again
she spoke with such cheerful helpfulness that they might in a common cause have been calling together and pledged to mutual aid
waymarsh at this as if he had been in question straightway turned from the window
oh yes countesshe has renewed acquaintance with me and he has i guess learnt something about me though i don't know how much he has liked it
it's for strether himself to say whether he has felt it justifies his course
oh but you said the countess gaily are not in the least what he came out foris he really strether
and i hadn't you at all in my mind
i was thinking of mr newsome of whom we think so much and with whom precisely mrs pocock has given herself the opportunity to take up threads
what a pleasure for you both
madame de vionnet with her eyes on sarah bravely continued
mrs pocock met her handsomely but strether quickly saw she meant to accept no version of her movements or plans from any other lips
she required no patronage and no support which were but other names for a false position she would show in her own way what she chose to show and this she expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him a fine woollett winter morning
i've never wanted for opportunities to see my brother
we've many things to think of at home and great responsibilities and occupations and our home's not an impossible place
we've plenty of reasons sarah continued a little piercingly for everything we doand in short she wouldn't give herself the least little scrap away
but she added as one who was always bland and who could afford a concession  i've come becausewell because we do come
ah then fortunately
madame de vionnet breathed it to the air
five minutes later they were on their feet for her to take leave standing together in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further exchange of remarks only with the emphasised appearance on waymarsh's part of a tendency to revert in a ruminating manner and as with an instinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread to an open window and his point of vantage
the glazed and gilded room all red damask ormolu mirrors clocks looked south and the shutters were bowed upon the summer morning but the tuileries garden and what was beyond it over which the whole place hung were things visible through gaps so that the farspreading presence of paris came up in coolness dimness and invitation in the twinkle of gilttipped palings the crunch of gravel the click of hoofs the crack of whips things that suggested some parade of the circus
i think it probable said mrs pocock that i shall have the opportunity of going to my brother's i've no doubt it's very pleasant indeed
she spoke as to strether but her face was turned with an intensity of brightness to madame de vionnet and there was a moment during which while she thus fronted her our friend expected to hear her add  i'm much obliged to you i'm sure for inviting me there
he guessed that for five seconds these words were on the point of coming he heard them as clearly as if they had been spoken but he presently knew they had just failedknew it by a glance quick and fine from madame de vionnet which told him that she too had felt them in the air but that the point had luckily not been made in any manner requiring notice
this left her free to reply only to what had been said
that the boulevard malesherbes may be common ground for us offers me the best prospect i see for the pleasure of meeting you again
oh i shall come to see you since you've been so good  and mrs pocock looked her invader well in the eyes
the flush in sarah's cheeks had by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that was not without its own bravery she held her head a good deal up and it came to strether that of the two at this moment she was the one who most carried out the idea of a countess
he quite took in however that she would really return her visitor's civility  she wouldn't report again at woollett without at least so much producible history as that in her pocket
i want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter
madame de vionnet went on and i should have brought her with me if i hadn't wished first to ask your leave
i was in hopes i should perhaps find miss pocock of whose being with you i've heard from mr newsome and whose acquaintance i should so much like my child to make
if i have the pleasure of seeing her and you do permit it i shall venture to ask her to be kind to jeanne
mr strether will tell youshe beautifully kept it upthat my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely
they've made friends he and she ever so happily and he doesn't i believe think ill of her
as for jeanne herself he has had the same success with her that i know he has had here wherever he has turned
she seemed to ask him for permission to say these things or seemed rather to take it softly and happily with the ease of intimacy for granted and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at any point more than halfway would be odiously basely to abandon her
yes he was with her and opposed even in this covert this semisafe fashion to those who were not he felt strangely and confusedly but excitedly inspiringly how much and how far
it was as if he had positively waited in suspense for something from her that would let him in deeper so that he might show her how he could take it
and what did in fact come as she drew out a little her farewell served sufficiently the purpose
as his success is a matter that i'm sure he'll never mention for himself i feel you see the less scruple which it's very good of me to say you know by the way she added as she addressed herself to him considering how little direct advantage i've gained from your triumphs with me
when does one ever see you
i wait at home and i languish
you'll have rendered me the service mrs pocock at least she wound up of giving me one of my muchtoorare glimpses of this gentleman
i certainly should be sorry to deprive you of anything that seems so much as you describe it your natural due
mr strether and i are very old friends sarah allowed but the privilege of his society isn't a thing i shall quarrel about with any one
and yet dear sarah he freely broke in i feel when i hear you say that that you don't quite do justice to the important truth of the extent to whichas you're also minei'm your natural due
i should like much better he laughed to see you fight for me
she met him mrs pocock on this with an arrest of speechwith a certain breathlessness as he immediately fancied on the score of a freedom for which she wasn't quite prepared
it had flared upfor all the harm he had intended by itbecause confoundedly he didn't want any more to be afraid about her than he wanted to be afraid about madame de vionnet
he had never naturally called her anything but sarah at home and though he had perhaps never quite so markedly invoked her as his dear that was somehow partly because no occasion had hitherto laid so effective a trap for it
but something admonished him now that it was too lateunless indeed it were possibly too early and that he at any rate shouldn't have pleased mrs pocock the more by it
well mr
strether
she murmured with vagueness yet with sharpness while her crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he was aware that this must be for the present the limit of her response
madame de vionnet had already however come to his aid and waymarsh as if for further participation moved again back to them
it was true that the aid rendered by madame de vionnet was questionable it was a sign that for all one might confess to with her and for all she might complain of not enjoying she could still insidiously show how much of the material of conversation had accumulated between them
the real truth is you know that you sacrifice one without mercy to dear old maria
she leaves no room in your life for anybody else
do you know she enquired of mrs pocock about dear old maria
the worst is that miss gostrey is really a wonderful woman
oh yes indeed strether answered for her mrs pocock knows about miss gostrey
your mother sarah must have told you about her your mother knows everything he sturdily pursued
and i cordially admit he added with his conscious gaiety of courage that she's as wonderful a woman as you like
ah it isn't i who 'like' dear mr strether anything to do with the matter
sarah pocock promptly protested and i'm by no means sure i havefrom my mother or from any one elsea notion of whom you're talking about
well he won't let you see her you know madame de vionnet sympathetically threw in
he never lets meold friends as we are i mean as i am with maria
he reserves her for his best hours keeps her consummately to himself only gives us others the crumbs of the feast
well countess i've had some of the crumbs waymarsh observed with weight and covering her with his large look which led her to break in before he could go on
comment donc he shares her with you
she exclaimed in droll stupefaction
take care you don't have before you go much further rather more of all ces dames than you may know what to do with
but he only continued in his massive way
i can post you about the lady mrs pocock so far as you may care to hear
i've seen her quite a number of times and i was practically present when they made acquaintance
i've kept my eye on her right along but i don't know as there's any real harm in her
'harm'
madame de vionnet quickly echoed
why she's the dearest and cleverest of all the clever and dear
well you run her pretty close countess waymarsh returned with spirit though there's no doubt she's pretty well up in things
she knows her way round europe
above all there's no doubt she does love strether
ah but we all do thatwe all love strether  it isn't a merit
their fellow visitor laughed keeping to her idea with a good conscience at which our friend was aware that he marvelled though he trusted also for it as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes to some later light
the prime effect of her tone howeverand it was a truth which his own eyes gave back to her in sad ironic playcould only be to make him feel that to say such things to a man in public a woman must practically think of him as ninety years old
he had turned awkwardly responsively red he knew at her mention of maria gostrey sarah pocock's presencethe particular quality of ithad made this inevitable and then he had grown still redder in proportion as he hated to have shown anything at all
he felt indeed that he was showing much as uncomfortably and almost in pain he offered up his redness to waymarsh who strangely enough seemed now to be looking at him with a certain explanatory yearning
something deepsomething built on their old old relationpassed in this complexity between them he got the sidewind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer questions
waymarsh's dry bare humouras it gave itself to be takengloomed out to demand justice
well if you talk of miss barrace i've my chance too it appeared stiffly to nod and it granted that it was giving him away but struggled to add that it did so only to save him
the sombre glow stared it at him till it fairly sounded outto save you poor old man to save you to save you in spite of yourself
yet it was somehow just this communication that showed him to himself as more than ever lost
still another result of it was to put before him as never yet that between his comrade and the interest represented by sarah there was already a basis
beyond all question now yes  waymarsh had been in occult relation with mrs newsomeout out it all came in the very effort of his face
yes you're feeling my handhe as good as proclaimed it but only because this at least i shall have got out of the damned old world  that i shall have picked up the pieces into which it has caused you to crumble
it was as if in short after an instant strether had not only had it from him but had recognised that so far as this went the instant had cleared the air
our friend understood and approved he had the sense that they wouldn't otherwise speak of it
this would be all and it would mark in himself a kind of intelligent generosity
it was with grim sarah thensarah grim for all her gracethat waymarsh had begun at ten o'clock in the morning to save him
wellif he could poor dear man with his big bleak kindness
the upshot of which crowded perception was that strether on his own side still showed no more than he absolutely had to
he showed the least possible by saying to mrs pocock after an interval much briefer than our glance at the picture reflected in him oh it's as true as they pleasethere's no miss gostrey for any one but menot the least little peep
i keep her to myself
well it's very good of you to notify me sarah replied without looking at him and thrown for a moment by this discrimination as the direction of her eyes showed upon a dimly desperate little community with madame de vionnet
but i hope i shan't miss her too much
madame de vionnet instantly rallied
and you knowthough it might occur to oneit isn't in the least that he's ashamed of her
she's reallyin a wayextremely goodlooking
ah but extremely
strether laughed while he wondered at the odd part he found thus imposed on him
it continued to be so by every touch from madame de vionnet
well as i say you know i wish you would keep me a little more to yourself
couldn't you name some day for me some hourand better soon than late
i'll be at home whenever it best suits you
therei can't say fairer
strether thought a moment while waymarsh and mrs pocock affected him as standing attentive
i did lately call on you
last weekwhile chad was out of town
yesand i was away as it happened too
you choose your moments well
but don't wait for my next absence for i shan't make another madame de vionnet declared while mrs pocock's here
that vow needn't keep you long fortunately sarah observed with reasserted suavity
i shall be at present but a short time in paris
i have my plans for other countries
i meet a number of charming friendsand her voice seemed to caress that description of these persons
ah then her visitor cheerfully replied all the more reason
tomorrow for instance or next day
she continued to strether
tuesday would do for me beautifully
tuesday then with pleasure
and at halfpast fiveor at six
it was ridiculous but mrs pocock and waymarsh struck him as fairly waiting for his answer
it was indeed as if they were arranged gathered for a performance the performance of europe by his confederate and himself
well the performance could only go on
say five fortyfive
five fortyfivegood
and now at last madame de vionnet must leave them though it carried for herself the performance a little further
i did hope so much also to see miss pocock
mayn't i still
sarah hesitated but she rose equal
she'll return your visit with me
she's at present out with mr pocock and my brother
i seeof course mr newsome has everything to show them
he has told me so much about her
my great desire's to give my daughter the opportunity of making her acquaintance
i'm always on the lookout for such chances for her
if i didn't bring her today it was only to make sure first that you'd let me
after which the charming woman risked a more intense appeal
it wouldn't suit you also to mention some near time so that we shall be sure not to lose you
strether on his side waited for sarah likewise had after all to perform and it occupied him to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at homeand on her first morning of pariswhile chad led the others forth
oh she was up to her eyes if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an understanding arrived at the evening before that waymarsh would come and find her alone
this was beginning wellfor a first day in paris and the thing might be amusing yet
but madame de vionnet's earnestness was meanwhile beautiful
you may think me indiscreet but i've such a desire my jeanne shall know an american girl of the really delightful kind
you see i throw myself for it on your charity
the manner of this speech gave strether such a sense of depths below it and behind it as he hadn't yet hadministered in a way that almost frightened him to his dim divinations of reasons but if sarah still in spite of it faltered this was why he had time for a sign of sympathy with her petitioner
let me say then dear lady to back your plea that miss mamie is of the most delightful kind of allis charming among the charming
even waymarsh though with more to produce on the subject could get into motion in time
yes countess the american girl's a thing that your country must at least allow ours the privilege to say we can show you
but her full beauty is only for those who know how to make use of her
ah then smiled madame de vionnet that's exactly what i want to do
i'm sure she has much to teach us
it was wonderful but what was scarce less so was that strether found himself by the quick effect of it moved another way
oh that may be
but don't speak of your own exquisite daughter you know as if she weren't pure perfection
i at least won't take that from you
mademoiselle de vionnet he explained in considerable form to mrs pocock is pure perfection
mademoiselle de vionnet is exquisite
it had been perhaps a little portentous but ah
sarah simply glittered
waymarsh himself for that matter apparently recognised in respect to the facts the need of a larger justice and he had with it an inclination to sarah
miss jane's strikingly handsomein the regular french style
it somehow made both strether and madame de vionnet laugh out though at the very moment he caught in sarah's eyes as glancing at the speaker a vague but unmistakeable you too
it made waymarsh in fact look consciously over her head
madame de vionnet meanwhile however made her point in her own way
i wish indeed i could offer you my poor child as a dazzling attraction  it would make one's position simple enough
she's as good as she can be but of course she's different and the question is nowin the light of the way things seem to goif she isn't after all too different too different i mean from the splendid type every one is so agreed that your wonderful country produces
on the other hand of course mr newsome who knows it so well has as a good friend dear kind man that he is done everything he canto keep us from fatal benightednessfor my small shy creature
well she wound up after mrs pocock had signified in a murmur still a little stiff that she would speak to her own young charge on the questionwell we shall sit my child and i and wait and wait and wait for you
but her last fine turn was for strether
do speak of us in such a way
as that something can't but come of it
oh something shall come of it
i take a great interest
he further declared and in proof of it the next moment he had gone with her down to her carriage
book ninth     i   the difficulty is strether said to madame de vionnet a couple of days later that i can't surprise them into the smallest sign of his not being the same old chad they've been for the last three years glowering at across the sea
they simply won't give any and as a policy you knowwhat you call a parti pris a deep gamethat's positively remarkable
it was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his hostess with the vision of it he had risen from his chair at the end of ten minutes and begun as a help not to worry to move about before her quite as he moved before maria
he had kept his appointment with her to the minute and had been intensely impatient though divided in truth between the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of having nothing at all
the short interval had in the face of their complication multiplied his impressionsit being meanwhile to be noted moreover that he already frankly already almost publicly viewed the complication as common to them
if madame de vionnet under sarah's eyes had pulled him into her boat there was by this time no doubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really most been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the vessel itself
they were in it together this moment as they hadn't yet been and he hadn't at present uttered the least of the words of alarm or remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel
he had other things to say to her than that she had put him in a position so quickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly altogether richly inevitable
that the outlook howevergiven the point of exposurehadn't cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was the first warning she received from him on his arrival
she had replied with indulgence that he was in too great a hurry and had remarked soothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely he might be
he felt her presence on the spot he felt her tone and everything about her as an aid to that effort and it was perhaps one of the proofs of her success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they talked
by the time he had explained to her why his impressions though multiplied still baffled him it was as if he had been familiarly talking for hours
they baffled him because sarahwell sarah was deep deeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself
he didn't say that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down as it were into her mother and that given mrs newsome's profundity the shaft thus sunk might well have a reach but he wasn't without a resigned apprehension that at such a rate of confidence between the two women he was likely soon to be moved to show how already at moments it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with mrs newsome
sarah to a certainty would have begun herself to feel it in himand this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more
from the moment she knew he could be tormented
but why can you be
his companion was surprised at his use of the word
because i'm made soi think of everything
ah one must never do that she smiled
one must think of as few things as possible
then he answered one must pick them out right
but all i mean isfor i express myself with violencethat she's in a position to watch me
there's an element of suspense for me and she can see me wriggle
but my wriggling doesn't matter he pursued
i can bear it
besides i shall wriggle out
the picture at any rate stirred in her an appreciation that he felt to be sincere
i don't see how a man can be kinder to a woman than you are to me
well kind was what he wanted to be yet even while her charming eyes rested on him with the truth of this he none the less had his humour of honesty
when i say suspense i mean you know he laughed suspense about my own case too
oh yesabout your own case too
it diminished his magnanimity but she only looked at him the more tenderly
not however he went on that i want to talk to you about that
it's my own little affair and i mentioned it simply as part of mrs pocock's advantage
no no though there was a queer present temptation in it and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a relief he wouldn't talk to her about mrs newsome wouldn't work off on her the anxiety produced in him by sarah's calculated omissions of reference
the effect she produced of representing her mother had been producedand that was just the immense the uncanny part of itwithout her having so much as mentioned that lady
she had brought no message had alluded to no question had only answered his enquiries with hopeless limited propriety
she had invented a way of meeting themas if he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation of distant degreethat made them almost ridiculous in him
he couldn't moreover on his own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately lacked news a circumstance of which it was sarah's profound policy not to betray a suspicion
these things all the same he wouldn't breathe to madame de vionnetmuch as they might make him walk up and down
and what he didn't sayas well as what she didn't for she had also her high decenciesenhanced the effect of his being there with her at the end of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he had yet had occasion to be
it ended in fact by being quite beautiful between them the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of not saying
he would have liked to turn her critically to the subject of mrs pocock but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the point of honour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her personal impression had been
he knew it for that matter without putting her to trouble that she wondered how with such elements sarah could still have no charm was one of the principal things she held her tongue about
strether would have been interested in her estimate of the elementsindubitably there some of them and to be appraised according to tastebut he denied himself even the luxury of this diversion
the way madame de vionnet affected him today was in itself a kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts
how could a woman think sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at it herself by such different roads
on the other hand of course sarah wasn't obliged to have it
he felt as if somehow madame de vionnet was
the great question meanwhile was what chad thought of his sister which was naturally ushered in by that of sarah's apprehension of chad
that they could talk of and with a freedom purchased by their discretion in other senses
the difficulty however was that they were reduced as yet to conjecture
he had given them in the day or two as little of a lead as sarah and madame de vionnet mentioned that she hadn't seen him since his sister's arrival
and does that strike you as such an age
she met it in all honesty
oh i won't pretend i don't miss him
sometimes i see him every day
our friendship's like that
make what you will of it
she whimsically smiled a little flicker of the kind occasional in her that had more than once moved him to wonder what he might best make of her
but he's perfectly right she hastened to add and i wouldn't have him fail in any way at present for the world
i'd sooner not see him for three months
i begged him to be beautiful to them and he fully feels it for himself
strether turned away under his quick perception she was so odd a mixture of lucidity and mystery
she fell in at moments with the theory about her he most cherished and she seemed at others to blow it into air
she spoke now as if her art were all an innocence and then again as if her innocence were all an art
oh he's giving himself up and he'll do so to the end
how can he but want now that it's within reach his full impressionwhich is much more important you know than either yours or mine
but he's just soaking strether said as he came back he's going in conscientiously for a saturation
i'm bound to say he is very good
ah she quietly replied to whom do you say it
and then more quietly still  he's capable of anything
strether more than reaffirmedoh he's excellent
i more and more like he insisted to see him with them though the oddity of this tone between them grew sharper for him even while they spoke
it placed the young man so before them as the result of her interest and the product of her genius acknowledged so her part in the phenomenon and made the phenomenon so rare that more than ever yet he might have been on the very point of asking her for some more detailed account of the whole business than he had yet received from her
the occasion almost forced upon him some question as to how she had managed and as to the appearance such miracles presented from her own singularly close place of survey
the moment in fact however passed giving way to more present history and he continued simply to mark his appreciation of the happy truth
it's a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust him
and then again while for a little she said nothingas if after all to her trust there might be a special limit  i mean for making a good show to them
yes she thoughtfully returnedbut if they shut their eyes to it
strether for an instant had his own thought
well perhaps that won't matter
you mean because he probablydo what they willwon't like them
oh 'do what they will'
they won't do much especially if sarah hasn't morewell more than one has yet made outto give
madame de vionnet weighed it
ah she has all her grace
it was a statement over which for a little they could look at each other sufficiently straight and though it produced no protest from strether the effect was somehow as if he had treated it as a joke
she may be persuasive and caressing with him she may be eloquent beyond words
she may get hold of him she wound upwell as neither you nor i have
yes she mayand now strether smiled
but he has spent all his time each day with jim
he's still showing jim round
she visibly wondered
then how about jim
strether took a turn before he answered
hasn't he given you jim
hasn't he before this 'done' him for you
he was a little at a loss
doesn't he tell you things
she hesitated
noand their eyes once more gave and took
not as you do
you somehow make me see themor at least feel them
and i haven't asked too much she added i've of late wanted so not to worry him
ah for that so have i he said with encouraging assent so thatas if she had answered everythingthey were briefly sociable on it
it threw him back on his other thought with which he took another turn stopping again however presently with something of a glow
you see jim's really immense
i think it will be jim who'll do it
she wondered
get hold of him
nojust the other thing
counteract sarah's spell
and he showed now our friend how far he had worked it out
jim's intensely cynical
oh dear jim
madame de vionnet vaguely smiled
yes literallydear jim
he's awful
what he wants heaven forgive him is to help us
you meanshe was eagerhelp me
well chad and me in the first place
but he throws you in too though without as yet seeing you much
only so far as he does see youif you don't mindhe sees you as awful
'awful'
she wanted it all
a regular bad onethough of course of a tremendously superior kind
dreadful delightful irresistible
ah dear jim
i should like to know him
i must
yes naturally
but will it do
you may you know strether suggested disappoint him
she was droll and humble about it
i can but try
but my wickedness then she went on is my recommendation for him
your wickedness and the charms with which in such a degree as yours he associates it
he understands you see that chad and i have above all wanted to have a good time and his view is simple and sharp
nothing will persuade himin the light that is of my behaviourthat i really didn't quite as much as chad come over to have one before it was too late
he wouldn't have expected it of me but men of my age at woollettand especially the least likely oneshave been noted as liable to strange outbreaks belated uncanny clutches at the unusual the ideal
it's an effect that a lifetime of woollett has quite been observed as having and i thus give it to you in jim's view for what it's worth
now his wife and his motherinlaw strether continued to explain have as in honour bound no patience with such phenomena late or earlywhich puts jim as against his relatives on the other side
besides he added i don't think he really wants chad back
if chad doesn't come  he'll havemadame de vionnet quite apprehendedmore of the free hand
well chad's the bigger man
so he'll work now en dessous to keep him quiet
nohe won't 'work' at all and he won't do anything en dessous
he's very decent and won't be a traitor in the camp
but he'll be amused with his own little view of our duplicity he'll sniff up what he supposes to be paris from morning till night and he'll be as to the rest for chadwell just what he is
she thought it over
a warning
he met it almost with glee
you are as wonderful as everybody says
and then to explain all he meant  i drove him about for his first hour and do you know whatall beautifully unconscioushe most put before me
why that something like that is at bottom as an improvement to his present state as in fact the real redemption of it what they think it may not be too late to make of our friend
with which as taking it in she seemed in her recurrent alarm bravely to gaze at the possibility he completed his statement
but it is too late
thanks to you
it drew from her again one of her indefinite reflexions
oh 'me'after all
he stood before her so exhilarated by his demonstration that he could fairly be jocular
everything's comparative
you're better than that
youshe could but answer himare better than anything
but she had another thought
will mrs pocock come to me
oh yesshe'll do that
as soon that is as my friend waymarshher friend nowleaves her leisure
she showed an interest
is he so much her friend as that
why didn't you see it all at the hotel
ohshe was amused'all' is a good deal to say
i don't knowi forget
i lost myself in her
you were splendid strether returnedbut 'all' isn't a good deal to say  it's only a little
yet it's charming so far as it goes
she wants a man to herself
and hasn't she got you
do you think she looked at meor even at youas if she had
strether easily dismissed that irony
every one you see must strike her as having somebody
you've got chadand chad has got you
i seeshe made of it what she could
and you've got maria
well he on his side accepted that
i've got maria
and maria has got me
so it goes
but mr jimwhom has he got
oh he has gotor it's as if he hadthe whole place
but for mr waymarshshe recalledisn't miss barrace before any one else
he shook his head
miss barrace is a raffinee and her amusement won't lose by mrs pocock
it will gain ratherespecially if sarah triumphs and she comes in for a view of it
how well you know us
madame de vionnet at this frankly sighed
noit seems to me it's we that i know
i know sarahit's perhaps on that ground only that my feet are firm
waymarsh will take her round while chad takes jimand i shall be i assure you delighted for both of them
sarah will have had what she requiresshe will have paid her tribute to the ideal and he will have done about the same
in paris it's in the airso what can one do less
if there's a point that beyond any other sarah wants to make it's that she didn't come out to be narrow
we shall feel at least that
oh she sighed the quantity we seem likely to 'feel'
but what becomes in these conditions of the girl
of mamieif we're all provided
ah for that said strether you can trust chad
to be you mean all right to her
to pay her every attention as soon as he has polished off jim
he wants what jim can give himand what jim really won'tthough he has had it all and more than all from me
he wants in short his own personal impression and he'll get itstrong
but as soon as he has got it mamie won't suffer
oh mamie mustn't suffer
madame de vionnet soothingly emphasised
but strether could reassure her
don't fear
as soon as he has done with jim jim will fall to me
and then you'll see
it was as if in a moment she saw already yet she still waited
then is she really quite charming
she asked
he had got up with his last words and gathered in his hat and gloves
i don't know i'm watching
i'm studying the case as it wereand i dare say i shall be able to tell you
she wondered
is it a case
yesi think so
at any rate i shall see'
but haven't you known her before
yes he smiledbut somehow at home she wasn't a case
she has become one since
it was as if he made it out for himself
she has become one here
so very very soon
he measured it laughing
not sooner than i did
and you became one
very very soon
the day i arrived
her intelligent eyes showed her thought of it
ah but the day you arrived you met maria
whom has miss pocock met
he paused again but he brought it out
hasn't she met chad
certainlybut not for the first time
he's an old friend
at which strether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her go on you mean that for her at least he's a new personthat she sees him as different
she sees him as different
and how does she see him
strether gave it up
how can one tell how a deep little girl sees a deep young man
is every one so deep
is she too
so it strikes me deeper than i thought
but wait a littlebetween us we'll make it out
you'll judge for that matter yourself
madame de vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance
then she will come with heri mean mamie with mrs
pocock
certainly
her curiosity if nothing else will in any case work that
but leave it all to chad
ah wailed madame de vionnet turning away a little wearily the things i leave to chad
the tone of it made him look at her with a kindness that showed his vision of her suspense
but he fell back on his confidence
oh welltrust him
trust him all the way
he had indeed no sooner so spoken than the queer displacement of his point of view appeared again to come up for him in the very sound which drew from him a short laugh immediately checked
he became still more advisory
when they do come give them plenty of miss jeanne
let mamie see her well
she looked for a moment as if she placed them face to face
for mamie to hate her
he had another of his corrective headshakes
mamie won't
trust them
she looked at him hard and then as if it were what she must always come back to  it's you i trust
but i was sincere she said at the hotel
i did i do want my child  well
strether waited with deference while she appeared to hesitate as to how to put it
well to do what she can for me
strether for a little met her eyes on it after which something that might have been unexpected to her came from him
poor little duck
not more expected for himself indeed might well have been her echo of it
poor little duck
but she immensely wants herself she said to see our friend's cousin
is that what she thinks her
it's what we call the young lady
he thought again then with a laugh  well your daughter will help you
and now at last he took leave of her as he had been intending for five minutes
but she went part of the way with him accompanying him out of the room and into the next and the next
her noble old apartment offered a succession of three the first two of which indeed on entering smaller than the last but each with its faded and formal air enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of approach
strether fancied them liked them and passing through them with her more slowly now met a sharp renewal of his original impression
he stopped he looked back the whole thing made a vista which he found high melancholy and sweetfull once more of dim historic shades of the faint faraway cannonroar of the great empire
it was doubtless half the projection of his mind but his mind was a thing that among old waxed parquets pale shades of pink and green pseudoclassic candelabra he had always needfully to reckon with
they could easily make him irrelevant
the oddity the originality the poetryhe didn't know what to call itof chad's connexion reaffirmed for him its romantic side
they ought to see this you know
they must
the pococks
she looked about in deprecation she seemed to see gaps he didn't
mamie and sarahmamie in particular
my shabby old place
but their things
oh their things
you were talking of what will do something for you  so that it strikes you she broke in that my poor place may
oh she ruefully mused that would be desperate
do you know what i wish
he went on
i wish mrs newsome herself could have a look
she stared missing a little his logic
it would make a difference
her tone was so earnest that as he continued to look about he laughed
it might
but you've told her you tell me  all about you
yes a wonderful story
but there's all the indescribablewhat one gets only on the spot
thank you
she charmingly and sadly smiled
it's all about me here he freely continued
mrs newsome feels things
but she seemed doomed always to come back to doubt
no one feels so much as you
nonot any one
so much the worse then for every one
it's very easy
they were by this time in the antechamber still alone together as she hadn't rung for a servant
the antechamber was high and square grave and suggestive too a little cold and slippery even in summer and with a few old prints that were precious strether divined on the walls
he stood in the middle slightly lingering vaguely directing his glasses while leaning against the doorpost of the room she gently pressed her cheek to the side of the recess
you would have been a friend
i
it startled him a little
for the reason you say
you're not stupid
and then abruptly as if bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact we're marrying jeanne
it affected him on the spot as a move in a game and he was even then not without the sense that that wasn't the way jeanne should be married
but he quickly showed his interest thoughas quickly afterwards struck himwith an absurd confusion of mind
'you'
you andanot chad
of course it was the child's father who made the 'we' but to the child's father it would have cost him an effort to allude
yet didn't it seem the next minute that monsieur de vionnet was after all not in questionsince she had gone on to say that it was indeed to chad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness itself
if i must tell you all it is he himself who has put us in the way
i mean in the way of an opportunity that so far as i can yet see is all i could possibly have dreamed of
for all the trouble monsieur de vionnet will ever take
it was the first time she had spoken to him of her husband and he couldn't have expressed how much more intimate with her it suddenly made him feel
it wasn't much in truththere were other things in what she was saying that were far more but it was as if while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of the past the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence
but our friend she asked hasn't then told you
he has told me nothing
well it has come with rather a rushall in a very few days and hasn't moreover yet taken a form that permits an announcement
it's only for youabsolutely you alonethat i speak i so want you to know
the sense he had so often had since the first hour of his disembarkment of being further and further in treated him again at this moment to another twinge but in this wonderful way of her putting him in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless
monsieur de vionnet will accept what he must accept
he has proposed half a dozen thingseach one more impossible than the other and he wouldn't have found this if he lives to a hundred
chad found it she continued with her lighted faintly flushed her conscious confidential face in the quietest way in the world
or rather it found himfor everything finds him i mean finds him right
you'll think we do such things strangelybut at my age she smiled one has to accept one's conditions
our young man's people had seen her one of his sisters a charming womanwe know all about themhad observed her somewhere with me
she had spoken to her brotherturned him on and we were again observed poor jeanne and i without our in the least knowing it
it was at the beginning of the winter it went on for some time it outlasted our absence it began again on our return and it luckily seems all right
the young man had met chad and he got a friend to approach himas having a decent interest in us
mr newsome looked well before he leaped he kept beautifully quiet and satisfied himself fully then only he spoke
it's what has for some time past occupied us
it seems as if it were what would do really really all one could wish
there are only two or three points to be settledthey depend on her father
but this time i think we're safe
strether consciously gaping a little had fairly hung upon her lips
i hope so with all my heart
and then he permitted himself does nothing depend on her
ah naturally everything did
but she's pleased comme tout
she has been perfectly free and heour young friendis really a combination
i quite adore him
strether just made sure
you mean your future soninlaw
future if we all bring it off
ah well said strether decorously i heartily hope you may
there seemed little else for him to say though her communication had the oddest effect on him
vaguely and confusedly he was troubled by it feeling as if he had even himself been concerned in something deep and dim
he had allowed for depths but these were greater  and it was as if oppressivelyindeed absurdlyhe was responsible for what they had now thrown up to the surface
it wasthrough something ancient and cold in itwhat he would have called the real thing
in short his hostess's news though he couldn't have explained why was a sensible shock and his oppression a weight he felt he must somehow or other immediately get rid of
there were too many connexions missing to make it tolerable he should do anything else
he was prepared to sufferbefore his own inner tribunalfor chad he was prepared to suffer even for madame de vionnet
but he wasn't prepared to suffer for the little girl so now having said the proper thing he wanted to get away
she held him an instant however with another appeal
do i seem to you very awful
awful
why so
but he called it to himself even as he spoke his biggest insincerity yet
our arrangements are so different from yours
mine
oh he could dismiss that too
i haven't any arrangements
then you must accept mine all the more that they're excellent
they're founded on a vieille sagesse
there will be much more if all goes well for you to hear and to know and everything believe me for you to like
don't be afraid you'll be satisfied
thus she could talk to him of what of her innermost lifefor that was what it came tohe must accept thus she could extraordinarily speak as if in such an affair his being satisfied had an importance
it was all a wonder and made the whole case larger
he had struck himself at the hotel before sarah and waymarsh as being in her boat but where on earth was he now
this question was in the air till her own lips quenched it with another
and do you suppose hewho loves her sowould do anything reckless or cruel
he wondered what he supposed
do you mean your young man
i mean yours
i mean mr
newsome
it flashed for strether the next moment a finer light and the light deepened as she went on
he takes thank god the truest tenderest interest in her
it deepened indeed
oh i'm sure of that
you were talking she said about one's trusting him
you see then how i do
he waited a momentit all came
i seei see
he felt he really did see
he wouldn't hurt her for the world norassuming she marries at allrisk anything that might make against her happiness
andwillingly at leasthe would never hurt me
her face with what he had by this time grasped told him more than her words whether something had come into it or whether he only read clearer her whole storywhat at least he then took for suchreached out to him from it
with the initiative she now attributed to chad it all made a sense and this sensea light a lead was what had abruptly risen before him
he wanted once more to get off with these things which was at last made easy a servant having for his assistance on hearing voices in the hall just come forward
all that strether had made out was while the man opened the door and impersonally waited summed up in his last word
i don't think you know chad will tell me anything
noperhaps not yet
and i won't as yet speak to him
ah that's as you'll think best
you must judge
she had finally given him her hand which he held a moment
how much i have to judge
everything said madame de vionnet  a remark that was indeedwith the refined disguised suppressed passion of her facewhat he most carried away
ii   so far as a direct approach was concerned sarah had neglected him for the week now about to end with a civil consistency of chill that giving him a higher idea of her social resource threw him back on the general reflexion that a woman could always be amazing
it indeed helped a little to console him that he felt sure she had for the same period also left chad's curiosity hanging though on the other hand for his personal relief chad could at least go through the various motionsand he made them extraordinarily numerousof seeing she had a good time
there wasn't a motion on which in her presence poor strether could so much as venture and all he could do when he was out of it was to walk over for a talk with maria
he walked over of course much less than usual but he found a special compensation in a certain halfhour during which toward the close of a crowded empty expensive day his several companions seemed to him so disposed of as to give his forms and usages a rest
he had been with them in the morning and had nevertheless called on the pococks in the afternoon but their whole group he then found had dispersed after a fashion of which it would amuse miss gostrey to hear
he was sorry again gratefully sorry she was so out of itshe who had really put him in but she had fortunately always her appetite for news
the pure flame of the disinterested burned in her cave of treasures as a lamp in a byzantine vault
it was just now as happened that for so fine a sense as hers a near view would have begun to pay
within three days precisely the situation on which he was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium the effect of his look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance
if the equilibrium might only prevail
sarah was out with waymarsh mamie was out with chad and jim was out alone
later on indeed he himself was booked to jim was to take him that evening to the varietieswhich strether was careful to pronounce as jim pronounced them
miss gostrey drank it in
what then tonight do the others do
well it has been arranged
waymarsh takes sarah to dine at bignons
she wondered
and what do they do after
they can't come straight home
no they can't come straight homeat least sarah can't
it's their secret but i think i've guessed it
then as she waited the circus
it made her stare a moment longer then laugh almost to extravagance
there's no one like you
like me
he only wanted to understand
like all of you togetherlike all of us  woollett milrose and their products
we're abysmalbut may we never be less so
mr newsome she continued meanwhile takes miss pocock
preciselyto the francais  to see what you took waymarsh and me to a familybill
ah then may mr chad enjoy it as i did
but she saw so much in things
do they spend their evenings your young people like that alone together
well they're young peoplebut they're old friends
i see i see
and do they dinefor a differenceat brebant's
oh where they dine is their secret too
but i've my idea that it will be very quietly at chad's own place
she'll come to him there alone
they looked at each other a moment
he has known her from a child
besides said strether with emphasis mamie's remarkable
she's splendid
she wondered
do you mean she expects to bring it off
getting hold of him
noi think not
she doesn't want him enoughor doesn't believe in her power
on which as he said nothing she continued  she finds she doesn't care for him
noi think she finds she does
but that's what i mean by so describing her
it's if she does that she's splendid
but we'll see he wound up where she comes out
you seem to show me sufficiently miss gostrey laughed where she goes in
but is her childhood's friend she asked permitting himself recklessly to flirt with her
nonot that
chad's also splendid
they're all splendid
he declared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy
they're at least happy
happy
it appeared with their various difficulties to surprise her
welli seem to myself among them the only one who isn't
she demurred
with your constant tribute to the ideal
he had a laugh at his tribute to the ideal but he explained after a moment his impression
i mean they're living
they're rushing about
i've already had my rushing
i'm waiting
but aren't you she asked by way of cheer waiting with me
he looked at her in all kindness
yesif it weren't for that
and you help me to wait she said
however she went on i've really something for you that will help you to wait and which you shall have in a minute
only there's something more i want from you first
i revel in sarah
so do i
if it weren't he again amusedly sighed for that
well you owe more to women than any man i ever saw
we do seem to keep you going
yet sarah as i see her must be great
she is strether fully assented  great
whatever happens she won't with these unforgettable days have lived in vain
miss gostrey had a pause
you mean she has fallen in love
i mean she wonders if she hasn'tand it serves all her purpose
it has indeed maria laughed served women's purposes before
yesfor giving in
but i doubt if the ideaas an ideahas ever up to now answered so well for holding out
that's her tribute to the idealwe each have our own
it's her romanceand it seems to me better on the whole than mine
to have it in paris too he explainedon this classic ground in this charged infectious air with so sudden an intensity  well it's more than she expected
she has had in short to recognise the breaking out for her of a real affinityand with everything to enhance the drama
miss gostrey followed
jim for instance
jim
jim hugely enhances
jim was made to enhance
and then mr waymarsh
it's the crowning touchit supplies the colour
he's positively separated
and she herself unfortunately isn'tthat supplies the colour too
miss gostrey was all there
but somehow
is he in love
strether looked at her a long time then looked all about the room then came a little nearer
will you never tell any one in the world as long as ever you live
never
it was charming
he thinks sarah really is
but he has no fear strether hastened to add
of her being affected by it
of his being
he likes it but he knows she can hold out
he's helping her he's floating her over by kindness
maria rather funnily considered it
floating her over in champagne
the kindness of dining her nose to nose at the hour when all paris is crowding to profane delights and in thewell in the great temple as one hears of it of pleasure
that's just it for both of them strether insistedand all of a supreme innocence
the parisian place the feverish hour the putting before her of a hundred francs' worth of food and drink which they'll scarcely touchall that's the dear man's own romance the expensive kind expensive in francs and centimes in which he abounds
and the circus afterwardswhich is cheaper but which he'll find some means of making as dear as possiblethat's also his tribute to the ideal
it does for him
he'll see her through
they won't talk of anything worse than you and me
well we're bad enough perhaps thank heaven she laughed to upset them
mr waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette
and the next moment she had dropped everything for a different pursuit
what you don't appear to know is that jeanne de vionnet has become engaged
she's to marryit has been definitely arrangedyoung monsieur de montbron
he fairly blushed
thenif you know itit's 'out'
don't i often know things that are not out
however she said this will be out tomorrow
but i see i've counted too much on your possible ignorance
you've been before me and i don't make you jump as i hoped
he gave a gasp at her insight
you never fail
i've had my jump
i had it when i first heard
then if you knew why didn't you tell me as soon as you came in
because i had it from her as a thing not yet to be spoken of
miss gostrey wondered
from madame de vionnet herself
as a probabilitynot quite a certainty  a good cause in which chad has been working
so i've waited
you need wait no longer she returned
it reached me yesterdayroundabout and accidental but by a person who had had it from one of the young man's own peopleas a thing quite settled
i was only keeping it for you
you thought chad wouldn't have told me
she hesitated
well if he hasn't  he hasn't
and yet the thing appears to have been practically his doing
so there we are
there we are
maria candidly echoed
that's why i jumped
i jumped he continued to explain because it means this disposition of the daughter that there's now nothing else nothing else but him and the mother
stillit simplifies
it simplifieshe fully concurred
but that's precisely where we are
it marks a stage in his relation
the act is his answer to mrs newsome's demonstration
it tells maria asked the worst
the worst
but is the worst what he wants sarah to know
he doesn't care for sarah
at which miss gostrey's eyebrows went up
you mean she has already dished herself
strether took a turn about he had thought it out again and again before this to the end but the vista seemed each time longer
he wants his good friend to know the best
i mean the measure of his attachment
she asked for a sign and he thought of that one
there it is
a concession to her jealousy
strether pulled up
yescall it that
make it luridfor that makes my problem richer
certainly let us have it luridfor i quite agree with you that we want none of our problems poor
but let us also have it clear
can he in the midst of such a preoccupation or on the heels of it have seriously cared for jeannecared i mean as a young man at liberty would have cared
well strether had mastered it
i think he can have thought it would be charming if he could care
it would be nicer
nicer than being tied up to marie
yesthan the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never hope short of a catastrophe to marry
and he was quite right said strether
it would certainly have been nicer
even when a thing's already nice there mostly is some other thing that would have been niceror as to which we wonder if it wouldn't
but his question was all the same a dream
he couldn't care in that way
he is tied up to marie
the relation is too special and has gone too far
it's the very basis and his recent lively contribution toward establishing jeanne in life has been his definite and final acknowledgement to madame de vionnet that he has ceased squirming
i doubt meanwhile he went on if sarah has at all directly attacked him
his companion brooded
but won't he wish for his own satisfaction to make his ground good to her
nohe'll leave it to me he'll leave everything to me
i 'sort of' feelhe worked it outthat the whole thing will come upon me
yes i shall have every inch and every ounce of it
i shall be used for it
and strether lost himself in the prospect
then he fancifully expressed the issue
to the last drop of my blood
maria however roundly protested
ah you'll please keep a drop for me
i shall have a use for it
which she didn't however follow up
she had come back the next moment to another matter
mrs pocock with her brother is trusting only to her general charm
so it would seem
and the charm's not working
well strether put it otherwise she's sounding the note of homewhich is the very best thing she can do
the best for madame de vionnet
the best for home itself
the natural one the right one
right maria asked when it fails
strether had a pause
the difficulty's jim
jim's the note of home
she debated
ah surely not the note of mrs
newsome
but he had it all
the note of the home for which mrs newsome wants himthe home of the business
jim stands with his little legs apart at the door of that tent and jim is frankly speaking extremely awful
maria stared
and you in you poor thing for your evening with him
oh he's all right for me
strether laughed
any one's good enough for me
but sarah shouldn't all the same have brought him
she doesn't appreciate him
his friend was amused with this statement of it
doesn't know you mean how bad he is
strether shook his head with decision
not really
she wondered
then doesn't mrs
newsome
it made him frankly do the same
well nosince you ask me
maria rubbed it in
not really either
not at all
she rates him rather high
with which indeed immediately he took himself up
well he is good too in his way
it depends on what you want him for
miss gostrey however wouldn't let it depend on anythingwouldn't have it and wouldn't want him at any price
it suits my book she said that he should be impossible and it suits it still better she more imaginatively added that mrs newsome doesn't know he is
strether in consequence had to take it from her but he fell back on something else
i'll tell you who does really know
mr waymarsh
never
never indeed
i'm not always thinking of mr waymarsh in fact i find now i never am
then he mentioned the person as if there were a good deal in it
mamie
his own sister
oddly enough it but let her down
what good will that do
none perhaps
but thereas usualwe are
iii   there they were yet again accordingly for two days more when strether on being at mrs pocock's hotel ushered into that lady's salon found himself at first assuming a mistake on the part of the servant who had introduced him and retired
the occupants hadn't come in for the room looked empty as only a room can look in paris of a fine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life carried on out of doors strays among scattered objects even as a summer air idles in a lonely garden
our friend looked about and hesitated observed on the evidence of a table charged with purchases and other matters that sarah had become possessedby no aid from himof the last number of the salmoncoloured revue noted further that mamie appeared to have received a present of fromentin's maitres d'autrefois from chad who had written her name on the cover and pulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he knew
this letter forwarded by a banker and arriving in mrs pocock's absence had been placed in evidence and it drew from the fact of its being unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its author
it brought home to him the scale on which mrs newsomefor she had been copious indeed this timewas writing to her daughter while she kept him in durance and it had altogether such an effect upon him as made him for a few minutes stand still and breathe low
in his own room at his own hotel he had dozens of wellfilled envelopes superscribed in that character and there was actually something in the renewal of his interrupted vision of the character that played straight into the so frequent question of whether he weren't already disinherited beyond appeal
it was such an assurance as the sharp downstrokes of her pen hadn't yet had occasion to give him but they somehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any decree of the writer
he looked at sarah's name and address in short as if he had been looking hard into her mother's face and then turned from it as if the face had declined to relax
but since it was in a manner as if mrs newsome were thereby all the more instead of the less in the room and were conscious sharply and sorely conscious of himself so he felt both held and hushed summoned to stay at least and take his punishment
by staying accordingly he took itcreeping softly and vaguely about and waiting for sarah to come in
she would come in if he stayed long enough and he had now more than ever the sense of her success in leaving him a prey to anxiety
it wasn't to be denied that she had had a happy instinct from the point of view of woollett in placing him thus at the mercy of her own initiative
it was very well to try to say he didn't carethat she might break ground when she would might never break it at all if she wouldn't and that he had no confession whatever to wait upon her with  he breathed from day to day an air that damnably required clearing and there were moments when he quite ached to precipitate that process
he couldn't doubt that should she only oblige him by surprising him just as he then was a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the concussion
he humbly circulated in this spirit till he suddenly had a fresh arrest
both the windows of the room stood open to the balcony but it was only now that in the glass of the leaf of one of them folded back he caught a reflexion quickly recognised as the colour of a lady's dress
somebody had been then all the while on the balcony and the person whoever it might be was so placed between the windows as to be hidden from him while on the other hand the many sounds of the street had covered his own entrance and movements
if the person were sarah he might on the spot therefore be served to his taste
he might lead her by a move or two up to the remedy for his vain tension as to which should he get nothing else from it he would at least have the relief of pulling down the roof on their heads
there was fortunately no one at hand to observein respect to his valourthat even on this completed reasoning he still hung fire
he had been waiting for mrs pocock and the sound of the oracle but he had to gird himself afreshwhich he did in the embrasure of the window neither advancing nor retreatingbefore provoking the revelation
it was apparently for sarah to come more into view he was in that case there at her service
she did however as meanwhile happened come more into view only she luckily came at the last minute as a contradiction of sarah
the occupant of the balcony was after all quite another person a person presented on a second look by a charming back and a slight shift of her position as beautiful brilliant unconscious mamiemamie alone at home mamie passing her time in her own innocent way mamie in short rather shabbily used but mamie absorbed interested and interesting
with her arms on the balustrade and her attention dropped to the street she allowed strether to watch her to consider several things without her turning round
but the oddity was that when he had so watched and considered he simply stepped back into the room without following up his advantage
he revolved there again for several minutes quite as with something new to think of and as if the bearings of the possibility of sarah had been superseded
for frankly yes it had bearings thus to find the girl in solitary possession
there was something in it that touched him to a point not to have been reckoned beforehand something that softly but quite pressingly spoke to him and that spoke the more each time he paused again at the edge of the balcony and saw her still unaware
her companions were plainly scattered sarah would be off somewhere with waymarsh and chad off somewhere with jim
strether didn't at all mentally impute to chad that he was with his good friend he gave him the benefit of supposing him involved in appearances that had he had to describe themfor instance to mariahe would have conveniently qualified as more subtle
it came to him indeed the next thing that there was perhaps almost an excess of refinement in having left mamie in such weather up there alone however she might in fact have extemporised under the charm of the rue de rivoli a little makeshift paris of wonder arid fancy
our friend in any case now recognisedand it was as if at the recognition mrs newsome's fixed intensity had suddenly with a deep audible gasp grown thin and vaguethat day after day he had been conscious in respect to his young lady of something odd and ambiguous yet something into which he could at last read a meaning
it had been at the most this mystery an obsessionoh an obsession agreeable and it had just now fallen into its place as at the touch of a spring
it had represented the possibility between them of some communication baffled by accident and delaythe possibility even of some relation as yet unacknowledged
there was always their old relation the fruit of the woollett years but thatand it was what was strangesthad nothing whatever in common with what was now in the air
as a child as a bud and then again as a flower of expansion mamie had bloomed for him freely in the almost incessantly open doorways of home where he remembered her as first very forward as then very backwardfor he had carried on at one period in mrs newsome's parlours oh mrs newsome's phases and his own
a course of english literature reenforced by exams and teasand once more finally as very much in advance
but he had kept no great sense of points of contact it not being in the nature of things at woollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in the same basket with the most withered of the winter apples
the child had given sharpness above all to his sense of the flight of time it was but the day before yesterday that he had tripped up on her hoop yet his experience of remarkable womendestined it would seem remarkably to growfelt itself ready this afternoon quite braced itself to include her
she had in fine more to say to him than he had ever dreamed the pretty girl of the moment could have and the proof of the circumstance was that visibly unmistakeably she had been able to say it to no one else
it was something she could mention neither to her brother to her sisterinlaw nor to chad though he could just imagine that had she still been at home she might have brought it out as a supreme tribute to age authority and attitude for mrs newsome
it was moreover something in which they all took an interest the strength of their interest was in truth just the reason of her prudence
all this then for five minutes was vivid to strether and it put before him that poor child she had now but her prudence to amuse her
that for a pretty girl in paris struck him with a rush as a sorry state so that under the impression he went out to her with a step as hypocritically alert he was well aware as if he had just come into the room
she turned with a start at his voice preoccupied with him though she might be she was just a scrap disappointed
oh i thought you were mr
bilham
the remark had been at first surprising and our friend's private thought under the influence of it temporarily blighted yet we are able to add that he presently recovered his inward tone and that many a fresh flower of fancy was to bloom in the same air
little bilhamsince little bilham was somewhat incongruously expectedappeared behindhand a circumstance by which strether was to profit
they came back into the room together after a little the couple on the balcony and amid its crimsonandgold elegance with the others still absent strether passed forty minutes that he appraised even at the time as far in the whole queer connexion from his idlest
yes indeed since he had the other day so agreed with maria about the inspiration of the lurid here was something for his problem that surely didn't make it shrink and that was floated in upon him as part of a sudden flood
he was doubtless not to know till afterwards on turning them over in thought of how many elements his impression was composed but he none the less felt as he sat with the charming girl the signal growth of a confidence
for she was charming when all was saidand none the less so for the visible habit and practice of freedom and fluency
she was charming he was aware in spite of the fact that if he hadn't found her so he would have found her something he should have been in peril of expressing as funny
yes she was funny wonderful mamie and without dreaming it she was bland she was bridalwith never that he could make out as yet a bridegroom to support it she was handsome and portly and easy and chatty soft and sweet and almost disconcertingly reassuring
she was dressed if we might so far discriminate less as a young lady than as an old onehad an old one been supposable to strether as so committed to vanity the complexities of her hair missed moreover also the looseness of youth and she had a mature manner of bending a little as to encourage and reward while she held neatly together in front of her a pair of strikingly polished hands  the combination of all of which kept up about her the glamour of her receiving placed her again perpetually between the windows and within sound of the icecream plates suggested the enumeration of all the names all the mr brookses and mr snookses gregarious specimens of a single type she was happy to meet
but if all this was where she was funny and if what was funnier than the rest was the contrast between her beautiful benevolent patronagesuch a hint of the polysyllabic as might make her something of a bore toward middle ageand her rather flat little voice the voice naturally unaffectedly yet of a girl of fifteen so strether none the less at the end of ten minutes felt in her a quiet dignity that pulled things bravely together
if quiet dignity almost more than matronly with voluminous too voluminous clothes was the effect she proposed to produce that was an ideal one could like in her when once one had got into relation
the great thing now for her visitor was that this was exactly what he had done it made so extraordinary a mixture of the brief and crowded hour
it was the mark of a relation that he had begun so quickly to find himself sure she was of all people as might have been said on the side and of the party of mrs newsome's original ambassador
she was in his interest and not in sarah's and some sign of that was precisely what he had been feeling in her these last days as imminent
finally placed in paris in immediate presence of the situation and of the hero of itby whom strether was incapable of meaning any one but chadshe had accomplished and really in a manner all unexpected to herself a change of base deep still things had come to pass within her and by the time she had grown sure of them strether had become aware of the little drama
when she knew where she was in short he had made it out and he made it out at present still better though with never a direct word passing between them all the while on the subject of his own predicament
there had been at first as he sat there with her a moment during which he wondered if she meant to break ground in respect to his prime undertaking
that door stood so strangely ajar that he was halfprepared to be conscious at any juncture of her having of any one's having quite bounced in
but friendly familiar light of touch and happy of tact she exquisitely stayed out so that it was for all the world as if to show she could deal with him without being reduced towell scarcely anything
it fully came up for them then by means of their talking of everything but chad that mamie unlike sarah unlike jim knew perfectly what had become of him
it fully came up that she had taken to the last fraction of an inch the measure of the change in him and that she wanted strether to know what a secret she proposed to make of it
they talked most convenientlyas if they had had no chance yetabout woollett and that had virtually the effect of their keeping the secret more close
the hour took on for strether little by little a queer sad sweetness of quality he had such a revulsion in mamie's favour and on behalf of her social value as might have come from remorse at some early injustice
she made him as under the breath of some vague western whiff homesick and freshly restless he could really for the time have fancied himself stranded with her on a far shore during an ominous calm in a quaint community of shipwreck
their little interview was like a picnic on a coral strand they passed each other with melancholy smiles and looks sufficiently allusive such cupfuls of water as they had saved
especially sharp in strether meanwhile was the conviction that his companion really knew as we have hinted where she had come out
it was at a very particular placeonly that she would never tell him it would be above all what he should have to puzzle for himself
this was what he hoped for because his interest in the girl wouldn't be complete without it
no more would the appreciation to which she was entitledso assured was he that the more he saw of her process the more he should see of her pride
she saw herself everything but she knew what she didn't want and that it was that had helped her
what didn't she wantthere was a pleasure lost for her old friend in not yet knowing as there would doubtless be a thrill in getting a glimpse
gently and sociably she kept that dark to him and it was as if she soothed and beguiled him in other ways to make up for it
she came out with her impression of madame de vionnetof whom she had heard so much she came out with her impression of jeanne whom she had been dying to see  she brought it out with a blandness by which her auditor was really stirred that she had been with sarah early that very afternoon and after dreadful delays caused by all sorts of things mainly eternally by the purchase of clothesclothes that unfortunately wouldn't be themselves eternalto call in the rue de bellechasse
at the sound of these names strether almost blushed to feel that he couldn't have sounded them firstand yet couldn't either have justified his squeamishness
mamie made them easy as he couldn't have begun to do and yet it could only have cost her more than he should ever have had to spend
it was as friends of chad's friends special distinguished desirable enviable that she spoke of them and she beautifully carried it off that much as she had heard of themthough she didn't say how or where which was a touch of her ownshe had found them beyond her supposition
she abounded in praise of them and after the manner of woollettwhich made the manner of woollett a loveable thing again to strether
he had never so felt the true inwardness of it as when his blooming companion pronounced the elder of the ladies of the rue de bellechasse too fascinating for words and declared of the younger that she was perfectly ideal a real little monster of charm
nothing she said of jeanne ought ever to happen to hershe's so awfully right as she is
another touch will spoil herso she oughtn't to be touched
ah but things here in paris strether observed do happen to little girls
and then for the joke's and the occasion's sake haven't you found that yourself
that things happen
oh i'm not a little girl
i'm a big battered blowsy one
i don't care mamie laughed what happens
strether had a pause while he wondered if it mightn't happen that he should give her the pleasure of learning that he found her nicer than he had really dreameda pause that ended when he had said to himself that so far as it at all mattered for her she had in fact perhaps already made this out
he risked accordingly a different questionthough conscious as soon as he had spoken that he seemed to place it in relation to her last speech
but that mademoiselle de vionnet is to be marriedi suppose you've heard of that
for all he then found he need fear
dear yes the gentleman was there monsieur de montbron whom madame de vionnet presented to us
and was he nice
mamie bloomed and bridled with her best reception manner
any man's nice when he's in love
it made strether laugh
but is monsieur de montbron in lovealreadywith you
oh that's not necessaryit's so much better he should be so with her which thank goodness i lost no time in discovering for myself
he's perfectly goneand i couldn't have borne it for her if he hadn't been
she's just too sweet
strether hesitated
and through being in love too
on which with a smile that struck him as wonderful mamie had a wonderful answer
she doesn't know if she is or not
it made him again laugh out
oh but you do
she was willing to take it that way
oh yes i know everything
and as she sat there rubbing her polished hands and making the best of itonly holding her elbows perhaps a little too much outthe momentary effect for strether was that every one else in all their affair seemed stupid
know that poor little jeanne doesn't know what's the matter with her
it was as near as they came to saying that she was probably in love with chad but it was quite near enough for what strether wanted which was to be confirmed in his certitude that whether in love or not she appealed to something large and easy in the girl before him
mamie would be fat too fat at thirty but she would always be the person who at the present sharp hour had been disinterestedly tender
if i see a little more of her as i hope i shall i think she'll like me enoughfor she seemed to like me todayto want me to tell her
and shall you
perfectly
i shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only too much to do right
to do right for her naturally said mamie is to please
her mother do you mean
her mother first
strether waited
and then
well 'then'mr
newsome
there was something really grand for him in the serenity of this reference
and last only monsieur de montbron
last onlyshe goodhumouredly kept it up
strether considered
so that every one after all then will be suited
she had one of her few hesitations but it was a question only of a moment and it was her nearest approach to being explicit with him about what was between them
i think i can speak for myself
i shall be
it said indeed so much told such a story of her being ready to help him so committed to him that truth in short for such use as he might make of it toward those ends of his own with which patiently and trustfully she had nothing to doit so fully achieved all this that he appeared to himself simply to meet it in its own spirit by the last frankness of admiration
admiration was of itself almost accusatory but nothing less would serve to show her how nearly he understood
he put out his hand for goodbye with a splendid splendid splendid
and he left her in her splendour still waiting for little bilham
book tenth     i   strether occupied beside little bilham three evenings after his interview with mamie pocock the same deep divan they had enjoyed together on the first occasion of our friend's meeting madame de vionnet and her daughter in the apartment of the boulevard malesherbes where his position affirmed itself again as ministering to an easy exchange of impressions
the present evening had a different stamp if the company was much more numerous so inevitably were the ideas set in motion
it was on the other hand however now strongly marked that the talkers moved in respect to such matters round an inner a protected circle
they knew at any rate what really concerned them tonight and strether had begun by keeping his companion close to it
only a few of chad's guests had dinedthat is fifteen or twenty a few compared with the large concourse offered to sight by eleven o'clock but number and mass quantity and quality light fragrance sound the overflow of hospitality meeting the high tide of response had all from the first pressed upon strether's consciousness and he felt himself somehow part and parcel of the most festive scene as the term was in which he had ever in his life been engaged
he had perhaps seen on fourths of july and on dear old domestic commencements more people assembled but he had never seen so many in proportion to the space or had at all events never known so great a promiscuity to show so markedly as picked
numerous as was the company it had still been made so by selection and what was above all rare for strether was that by no fault of his own he was in the secret of the principle that had worked
he hadn't enquired he had averted his head but chad had put him a pair of questions that themselves smoothed the ground
he hadn't answered the questions he had replied that they were the young man's own affair and he had then seen perfectly that the latter's direction was already settled
chad had applied for counsel only by way of intimating that he knew what to do and he had clearly never known it better than in now presenting to his sister the whole circle of his society
this was all in the sense and the spirit of the note struck by him on that lady's arrival he had taken at the station itself a line that led him without a break and that enabled him to lead the pococksthough dazed a little no doubt breathless no doubt and bewilderedto the uttermost end of the passage accepted by them perforce as pleasant
he had made it for them violently pleasant and mercilessly full the upshot of which was to strether's vision that they had come all the way without discovering it to be really no passage at all
it was a brave blind alley where to pass was impossible and where unless they stuck fast they would havewhich was always awkwardpublicly to back out
they were touching bottom assuredly tonight the whole scene represented the terminus of the culdesac
so could things go when there was a hand to keep them consistenta hand that pulled the wire with a skill at which the elder man more and more marvelled
the elder man felt responsible but he also felt successful since what had taken place was simply the issue of his own contention six weeks before that they properly should wait to see what their friends would have really to say
he had determined chad to wait he had determined him to see he was therefore not to quarrel with the time given up to the business
as much as ever accordingly now that a fortnight had elapsed the situation created for sarah and against which she had raised no protest was that of her having accommodated herself to her adventure as to a pleasureparty surrendered perhaps even somewhat in excess to bustle and to pace
if her brother had been at any point the least bit open to criticism it might have been on the ground of his spicing the draught too highly and pouring the cup too full
frankly treating the whole occasion of the presence of his relatives as an opportunity for amusement he left it no doubt but scant margin as an opportunity for anything else
he suggested invented aboundedyet all the while with the loosest easiest rein
strether during his own weeks had gained a sense of knowing paris but he saw it afresh and with fresh emotion in the form of the knowledge offered to his colleague
a thousand unuttered thoughts hummed for him in the air of these observations not the least frequent of which was that sarah might well of a truth not quite know whither she was drifting
she was in no position not to appear to expect that chad should treat her handsomely yet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time she missed the chance of marking the great nuance
the great nuance was in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomelyshe should like to see him not but that treating her handsomely none the less wasn't all in alltreating her handsomely buttered no parsnips and that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back
strether watching after his habit and overscoring with thought positively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for heroccasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump
would she jump could she would that be a safe placedthis question at such instants sat for him in her lapse into pallor her tight lips her conscious eyes
it came back to the main point at issue would she be after all to be squared
he believed on the whole she would jump yet his alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his suspense
one thing remained well before hima conviction that was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening that if she should gather in her skirts close her eyes and quit the carriage while in motion he would promptly enough become aware
she would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him it would be appointed to him unquestionably to receive her entire weight
signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened multiplied even through the dazzle of chad's party
it was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that leaving almost every one in the two other rooms leaving those of the guests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of both sexes and of several varieties of speech he had desired five quiet minutes with little bilham whom he always found soothing and even a little inspiring and to whom he had actually moreover something distinct and important to say
he had felt of oldfor it already seemed long agorather humiliated at discovering he could learn in talk with a personage so much his junior the lesson of a certain moral ease but he had now got used to thatwhether or no the mixture of the fact with other humiliations had made it indistinct whether or no directly from little bilham's example the example of his being contentedly just the obscure and acute little bilham he was
it worked so for him strether seemed to see and our friend had at private hours a wan smile over the fact that he himself after so many more years was still in search of something that would work
however as we have said it worked just now for them equally to have found a corner a little apart
what particularly kept it apart was the circumstance that the music in the salon was admirable with two or three such singers as it was a privilege to hear in private
their presence gave a distinction to chad's entertainment and the interest of calculating their effect on sarah was actually so sharp as to be almost painful
unmistakeably in her single person the motive of the composition and dressed in a splendour of crimson which affected strether as the sound of a fall through a skylight she would now be in the forefront of the listening circle and committed by it up to her eyes
those eyes during the wonderful dinner itself he hadn't once met having confessedlyperhaps a little pusillanimouslyarranged with chad that he should be on the same side of the table
but there was no use in having arrived now with little bilham at an unprecedented point of intimacy unless he could pitch everything into the pot
you who sat where you could see her what does she make of it all
by which i mean on what terms does she take it
oh she takes it i judge as proving that the claim of his family is more than ever justified
she isn't then pleased with what he has to show
on the contrary she's pleased with it as with his capacity to do this kind of thingmore than she has been pleased with anything for a long time
but she wants him to show it there
he has no right to waste it on the likes of us
strether wondered
she wants him to move the whole thing over
the whole thingwith an important exception
everything he has 'picked up'and the way he knows how
she sees no difficulty in that
she'd run the show herself and she'll make the handsome concession that woollett would be on the whole in some ways the better for it
not that it wouldn't be also in some ways the better for woollett
the people there are just as good
just as good as you and these others
ah that may be
but such an occasion as this whether or no strether said isn't the people
it's what has made the people possible
well then his friend replied there you are i give you my impression for what it's worth
mrs pocock has seen and that's tonight how she sits there
if you were to have a glimpse of her face you'd understand me
she has made up her mindto the sound of expensive music
strether took it freely in
ah then i shall have news of her
i don't want to frighten you but i think that likely
however little bilham continued if i'm of the least use to you to hold on by
you're not of the least
and strether laid an appreciative hand on him to say it
no one's of the least
with which to mark how gaily he could take it he patted his companion's knee
i must meet my fate alone and i shalloh you'll see
and yet he pursued the next moment you can help me too
you once said to mehe followed this furtherthat you held chad should marry
i didn't see then so well as i know now that you meant he should marry miss pocock
do you still consider that he should
because if you dohe kept it upi want you immediately to change your mind
you can help me that way
help you by thinking he should not marry
not marry at all events mamie
and who then
ah strether returned that i'm not obliged to say
but madame de vionneti suggestwhen he can'
oh
said little bilham with some sharpness
oh precisely
but he needn't marry at alli'm at any rate not obliged to provide for it
whereas in your case i rather feel that i am
little bilham was amused
obliged to provide for my marrying
yesafter all i've done to you
the young man weighed it
have you done as much as that
well said strether thus challenged of course i must remember what you've also done to me
we may perhaps call it square
but all the same he went on i wish awfully you'd marry mamie pocock yourself
little bilham laughed out
why it was only the other night in this very place that you were proposing to me a different union altogether
mademoiselle de vionnet
well strether easily confessed it
that i admit was a vain image
this is practical politics
i want to do something good for both of youi wish you each so well and you can see in a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the same stroke
she likes you you know
you console her
and she's splendid
little bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped plate
what do i console her for
it just made his friend impatient
oh come you knows  and what proves for you that she likes me
why the fact that i found her three days ago stopping at home alone all the golden afternoon on the mere chance that you'd come to her and hanging over her balcony on that of seeing your cab drive up
i don't know what you want more
little bilham after a moment found it
only just to know what proves to you that i like her
oh if what i've just mentioned isn't enough to make you do it you're a stonyhearted little fiend
besidesstrether encouraged his fancy's flightyou showed your inclination in the way you kept her waiting kept her on purpose to see if she cared enough for you
his companion paid his ingenuity the deference of a pause
i didn't keep her waiting
i came at the hour
i wouldn't have kept her waiting for the world the young man honourably declared
better stillthen there you are
and strether charmed held him the faster
even if you didn't do her justice moreover he continued i should insist on your immediately coming round to it
i want awfully to have worked it
i wantand our friend spoke now with a yearning that was really earnestat least to have done that
to have married me offwithout a penny
well i shan't live long and i give you my word now and here that i'll leave you every penny of my own
i haven't many unfortunately but you shall have them all
and miss pocock i think has a few
i want strether went on to have been at least to that extent constructive even expiatory
i've been sacrificing so to strange gods that i feel i want to put on record somehow my fidelityfundamentally unchanged after allto our own
i feel as if my hands were embrued with the blood of monstrous alien altarsof another faith altogether
there it isit's done
and then he further explained
it took hold of me because the idea of getting her quite out of the way for chad helps to clear my ground
the young man at this bounced about and it brought them face to face in admitted amusement
you want me to marry as a convenience to chad
no strether debatedhe doesn't care whether you marry or not
it's as a convenience simply to my own plan for him
'simply'
and little bilham's concurrence was in itself a lively comment
thank you
but i thought he continued you had exactly no plan 'for' him
well then call it my plan for myselfwhich may be well as you say to have none
his situation don't you see
is reduced now to the bare facts one has to recognise
mamie doesn't want him and he doesn't want mamie  so much as that these days have made clear
it's a thread we can wind up and tuck in
but little bilham still questioned
you cansince you seem so much to want to
but why should i
poor strether thought it over but was obliged of course to admit that his demonstration did superficially fail
seriously there is no reason
it's my affairi must do it alone
i've only my fantastic need of making my dose stiff
little bilham wondered
what do you call your dose
why what i have to swallow
i want my conditions unmitigated
he had spoken in the tone of talk for talk's sake and yet with an obscure truth lurking in the loose folds a circumstance presently not without its effect on his young friend
little bilham's eyes rested on him a moment with some intensity then suddenly as if everything had cleared up he gave a happy laugh
it seemed to say that if pretending or even trying or still even hoping to be able to care for mamie would be of use he was all there for the job
i'll do anything in the world for you
well strether smiled anything in the world is all i want
i don't know anything that pleased me in her more he went on than the way that on my finding her up there all alone coming on her unawares and feeling greatly for her being so out of it she knocked down my tall house of cards with her instant and cheerful allusion to the next young man
it was somehow so the note i neededher staying at home to receive him
it was chad of course said little bilham who asked the next young mani like your name for meto call
so i supposedall of which thank god is in our innocent and natural manners
but do you know strether asked if chad knows
and then as this interlocutor seemed at a loss why where she has come out
little bilham at this met his face with a conscious lookit was as if more than anything yet the allusion had penetrated
do you know yourself
strether lightly shook his head
there i stop
oh odd as it may appear to you there are things i don't know
i only got the sense from her of something very sharp and yet very deep down that she was keeping all to herself
that is i had begun with the belief that she had kept it to herself but face to face with her there i soon made out that there was a person with whom she would have shared it
i had thought she possibly might with mebut i saw then that i was only half in her confidence
when turning to me to greet mefor she was on the balcony and i had come in without her knowing itshe showed me she had been expecting you and was proportionately disappointed i got hold of the tail of my conviction
half an hour later i was in possession of all the rest of it
you know what has happened
he looked at his young friend hardthen he felt sure
for all you say you're up to your eyes
so there you are
little bilham after an instant pulled half round
i assure you she hasn't told me anything
of course she hasn't
for what do you suggest that i suppose her to take you
but you've been with her every day you've seen her freely you've liked her greatlyi stick to thatand you've made your profit of it
you know what she has been through as well as you know that she has dined here tonightwhich must have put her by the way through a good deal more
the young man faced this blast after which he pulled round the rest of the way
i haven't in the least said she hasn't been nice to me
but she's proud
and quite properly
but not too proud for that
it's just her pride that has made her
chad little bilham loyally went on has really been as kind to her as possible
it's awkward for a man when a girl's in love with him
ah but she isn'tnow
little bilham sat staring before him then he sprang up as if his friend's penetration recurrent and insistent made him really after all too nervous
noshe isn't now
it isn't in the least he went on chad's fault
he's really all right
i mean he would have been willing
but she came over with ideas
those she had got at home
they had been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife
she was to save our friend
ah like me poor thing
strether also got to his feet
exactlyshe had a bad moment
it was very soon distinct to her to pull her up to let her down that alas he was he is saved
there's nothing left for her to do
not even to love him
she would have loved him better as she originally believed him
strether wondered of course one asks one's self what notion a little girl forms where a young man's in question of such a history and such a state
well this little girl saw them no doubt as obscure but she saw them practically as wrong
the wrong for her was the obscure
chad turns out at any rate right and good and disconcerting while what she was all prepared for primed and girded and wound up for was to deal with him as the general opposite
yet wasn't her whole pointstrether weighed itthat he was to be that he could be made better redeemed
little bilham fixed it all a moment and then with a small headshake that diffused a tenderness  she's too late
too late for the miracle
yeshis companion saw enough
still if the worst fault of his condition is that it may be all there for her to profit by
oh she doesn't want to 'profit' in that flat way
she doesn't want to profit by another woman's workshe wants the miracle to have been her own miracle
that's what she's too late for
strether quite felt how it all fitted yet there seemed one loose piece
i'm bound to say you know that she strikes one on these lines as fastidiouswhat you call here difficile
little bilham tossed up his chin
of course she's difficileon any lines
what else in the world are our mamiesthe real the right ones
i see i see our friend repeated charmed by the responsive wisdom he had ended by so richly extracting
mamie is one of the real and the right
the very thing itself
and what it comes to then strether went on is that poor awful chad is simply too good for her
ah too good was what he was after all to be but it was she herself and she herself only who was to have made him so
it hung beautifully together but with still a loose end
wouldn't he do for her even if he should after all break  with his actual influence
oh little bilham had for this enquiry the sharpest of all his controls
how can he 'do'on any terms whateverwhen he's flagrantly spoiled
strether could only meet the question with his passive his receptive pleasure
well thank goodness you're not
you remain for her to save and i come back on so beautiful and full a demonstration to my contention of just nowthat of your showing distinct signs of her having already begun
the most he could further say to himselfas his young friend turned awaywas that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial
little bilham taking his course back to the music only shook his goodnatured ears an instant in the manner of a terrier who has got wet while strether relapsed into the sensewhich had for him in these days most of comfortthat he was free to believe in anything that from hour to hour kept him going
he had positively motions and flutters of this conscious hourtohour kind temporary surrenders to irony to fancy frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of observation constantly stronger for him as he felt in scent and colour and in which he could bury his nose even to wantonness
this last resource was offered him for that matter in the very form of his next clear perceptionthe vision of a prompt meeting in the doorway of the room between little bilham and brilliant miss barrace who was entering as bilham withdrew
she had apparently put him a question to which he had replied by turning to indicate his late interlocutor toward whom after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that optical machinery which seemed like her other ornaments curious and archaic the genial lady suggesting more than ever for her fellow guest the old french print the historic portrait directed herself with an intention that strether instantly met
he knew in advance the first note she would sound and took in as she approached all her need of sounding it
nothing yet had been so wonderful between them as the present occasion and it was her special sense of this quality in occasions that she was there as she was in most places to feed
that sense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she had quitted the other room forsaken the music dropped out of the play abandoned in a word the stage itself that she might stand a minute behind the scenes with strether and so perhaps figure as one of the famous augurs replying behind the oracle to the wink of the other
seated near him presently where little bilham had sat she replied in truth to many things beginning as soon as he had said to herwhat he hoped he said without fatuityall you ladies are extraordinarily kind to me
she played her long handle which shifted her observation she saw in an instant all the absences that left them free
how can we be anything else
but isn't that exactly your plight
'we ladies'oh we're nice and you must be having enough of us
as one of us you know i don't pretend i'm crazy about us
but miss gostrey at least tonight has left you alone hasn't she
with which she again looked about as if maria might still lurk
oh yes said strether she's only sitting up for me at home
and then as this elicited from his companion her gay oh oh oh
he explained that he meant sitting up in suspense and prayer
we thought it on the whole better she shouldn't be present and either way of course it's a terrible worry for her
he abounded in the sense of his appeal to the ladies and they might take their choice of his doing so from humility or from pride
yet she inclines to believe i shall come out
oh i incline to believe too you'll come out
miss barrace with her laugh was not to be behind
only the question's about where isn't it
however she happily continued if it's anywhere at all it must be very far on mustn't it
to do us justice i think you know she laughed we do among us all want you rather far on
yes yes she repeated in her quick droll way we want you very very far on
after which she wished to know why he had thought it better maria shouldn't be present
oh he replied it was really her own idea
i should have wished it
but she dreads responsibility
and isn't that a new thing for her
to dread it
no doubtno doubt
but her nerve has given way
miss barrace looked at him a moment
she has too much at stake
then less gravely  mine luckily for me holds out
luckily for me toostrether came back to that
my own isn't so firm my appetite for responsibility isn't so sharp as that i haven't felt the very principle of this occasion to be 'the more the merrier'
if we are so merry it's because chad has understood so well
he has understood amazingly said miss barrace
it's wonderfulstrether anticipated for her
it's wonderful
she to meet it intensified so that face to face over it they largely and recklessly laughed
but she presently added oh i see the principle
if one didn't one would be lost
but when once one has got hold of it  it's as simple as twice two
from the moment he had to do something  a crowdshe took him straight upwas the only thing
rather rather  a rumpus of sound she laughed or nothing
mrs pocock's built in or built outwhichever you call it she's packed so tight she can't move
she's in splendid isolationmiss barrace embroidered the theme
strether followed but scrupulous of justice
yet with every one in the place successively introduced to her
wonderfullybut just so that it does build her out
she's bricked up she's buried alive
strether seemed for a moment to look at it but it brought him to a sigh
oh but she's not dead
it will take more than this to kill her
his companion had a pause that might have been for pity
no i can't pretend i think she's finishedor that it's for more than tonight
she remained pensive as if with the same compunction
it's only up to her chin
then again for the fun of it  she can breathe
she can breathe
he echoed it in the same spirit
and do you know he went on what's really all this time happening to methrough the beauty of music the gaiety of voices the uproar in short of our revel and the felicity of your wit
the sound of mrs pocock's respiration drowns for me i assure you every other
it's literally all i hear
she focussed him with her clink of chains
well
she breathed ever so kindly
well what
she is free from her chin up she mused and that will be enough for her
it will be enough for me
strether ruefully laughed
waymarsh has really he then asked brought her to see you
yesbut that's the worst of it
i could do you no good
and yet i tried hard
strether wondered
and how did you try
why i didn't speak of you
i see
that was better
then what would have been worse
for speaking or silent she lightly wailed i somehow 'compromise'
and it has never been any one but you
that showshe was magnanimousthat it's something not in you but in one's self
it's my fault
she was silent a little
no it's mr waymarsh's
it's the fault of his having brought her
ah then said strether goodnaturedly why did he bring her
he couldn't afford not to
oh you were a trophyone of the spoils of conquest
but why in that case since you do 'compromise'  don't i compromise him as well
i do compromise him as well miss barrace smiled
i compromise him as hard as i can
but for mr waymarsh it isn't fatal
it'sso far as his wonderful relation with mrs pocock is concernedfavourable
and then as he still seemed slightly at sea  the man who had succeeded with me don't you see
for her to get him from me was such an added incentive
strether saw but as if his path was still strewn with surprises
it's 'from' you then that she has got him
she was amused at his momentary muddle
you can fancy my fight
she believes in her triumph
i think it has been part of her joy
oh her joy
strether sceptically murmured
well she thinks she has had her own way
and what's tonight for her but a kind of apotheosis
her frock's really good
good enough to go to heaven in
for after a real apotheosis strether went on there's nothing but heaven
for sarah there's only tomorrow
and you mean that she won't find tomorrow heavenly
well i mean that i somehow feel tonighton her behalftoo good to be true
she has had her cake that is she's in the act now of having it of swallowing the largest and sweetest piece
there won't be another left for her
certainly i haven't one
it can only at the best be chad
he continued to make it out as for their common entertainment
he may have one as it were up his sleeve yet it's borne in upon me that if he had  he wouldn'tshe quite understoodhave taken all this trouble
i dare say not and if i may be quite free and dreadful i very much hope he won't take any more
of course i won't pretend now she added not to know what it's a question of
oh every one must know now poor strether thoughtfully admitted and it's strange enough and funny enough that one should feel everybody here at this very moment to be knowing and watching and waiting
yesisn't it indeed funny
miss barrace quite rose to it
that's the way we are in paris
she was always pleased with a new contribution to that queerness
it's wonderful
but you know she declared it all depends on you
i don't want to turn the knife in your vitals but that's naturally what you just now meant by our all being on top of you
we know you as the hero of the drama and we're gathered to see what you'll do
strether looked at her a moment with a light perhaps slightly obscured
i think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner
he's scared at his heroismhe shrinks from his part
ah but we nevertheless believe he'll play it
that's why miss barrace kindly went on we take such an interest in you
we feel you'll come up to the scratch
and then as he seemed perhaps not quite to take fire  don't let him do it
don't let chad go
yes keep hold of him
with all thisand she indicated the general tributehe has done enough
we love him herehe's charming
it's beautiful said strether the way you all can simplify when you will
but she gave it to him back
it's nothing to the way you will when you must
he winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy and it kept him a moment quiet
he detained her however on her appearing about to leave him alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made
there positively isn't a sign of a hero tonight the hero's dodging and shirking the hero's ashamed
therefore you know i think what you must all really be occupied with is the heroine
miss barrace took a minute
the heroine
the heroine
i've treated her said strether not a bit like a hero
oh he sighed i don't do it well
she eased him off
you do it as you can
and then after another hesitation  i think she's satisfied
but he remained compunctious
i haven't been near her
i haven't looked at her
ah then you've lost a good deal
he showed he knew it
she's more wonderful than ever
than ever
with mr
pocock
strether wondered
madame de vionnetwith jim
madame de vionnetwith 'jim'
miss barrace was historic
and what's she doing with him
ah you must ask him
strether's face lighted again at the prospect
it will be amusing to do so
yet he continued to wonder
but she must have some idea
of course she hasshe has twenty ideas
she has in the first place said miss barrace swinging a little her tortoiseshell that of doing her part
her part is to help you
it came out as nothing had come yet links were missing and connexions unnamed but it was suddenly as if they were at the heart of their subject
yes how much more she does it strether gravely reflected than i help her
it all came over him as with the near presence of the beauty the grace the intense dissimulated spirit with which he had as he said been putting off contact
she has courage
ah she has courage
miss barrace quite agreed and it was as if for a moment they saw the quantity in each other's face
but indeed the whole thing was present
how much she must care
ah there it is
she does care
but it isn't is it miss barrace considerately added as if you had ever had any doubt of that
strether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he really never had
why of course it's the whole point
voila
miss barrace smiled
it's why one came out strether went on
and it's why one has stayed so long
and it's alsohe aboundedwhy one's going home
it's why it's why  it's why everything
she concurred
it's why she might be tonightfor all she looks and shows and for all your friend 'jim' doesabout twenty years old
that's another of her ideas to be for him and to be quite easily and charmingly as young as a little girl
strether assisted at his distance
'for him'
for chad
for chad in a manner naturally always
but in particular tonight for mr
pocock
and then as her friend still stared yes it is of a bravery but that's what she has  her high sense of duty
it was more than sufficiently before them
when mr newsome has his hands so embarrassed with his sister  it's quite the leaststrether filled it outthat she should take his sister's husband
certainlyquite the least
so she has taken him
she has taken him
it was all miss barrace had meant
still it remained enough
it must be funny
oh it is funny
that of course essentially went with it
but it brought them back
how indeed then she must care
in answer to which strether's entertainer dropped a comprehensive ah
expressive perhaps of some impatience for the time he took to get used to it
she herself had got used to it long before
ii   when one morning within the week he perceived the whole thing to be really at last upon him strether's immediate feeling was all relief
he had known this morning that something was about to happenknown it in a moment by waymarsh's manner when waymarsh appeared before him during his brief consumption of coffee and a roll in the small slippery salleamanger so associated with rich rumination
strether had taken there of late various lonely and absentminded meals he communed there even at the end of june with a suspected chill the air of old shivers mixed with old savours the air in which so many of his impressions had perversely matured the place meanwhile renewing its message to him by the very circumstance of his single state
he now sat there for the most part to sigh softly while he vaguely tilted his carafe over the vision of how much better waymarsh was occupied
that was really his success by the common measureto have led this companion so on and on
he remembered how at first there had been scarce a squattingplace he could beguile him into passing the actual outcome of which at last was that there was scarce one that could arrest him in his rush
his rushas strether vividly and amusedly figured itcontinued to be all with sarah and contained perhaps moreover the word of the whole enigma whipping up in its fine fullflavoured froth the very principle for good or for ill of his own of strether's destiny
it might after all to the end only be that they had united to save him and indeed so far as waymarsh was concerned that had to be the spring of action
strether was glad at all events in connexion with the case that the saving he required was not more scant so constituted a luxury was it in certain lights just to lurk there out of the full glare
he had moments of quite seriously wondering whether waymarsh wouldn't in fact thanks to old friendship and a conceivable indulgence make about as good terms for him as he might make for himself
they wouldn't be the same terms of course but they might have the advantage that he himself probably should be able to make none at all
he was never in the morning very late but waymarsh had already been out and after a peep into the dim refectory he presented himself with much less than usual of his large looseness
he had made sure through the expanse of glass exposed to the court that they would be alone and there was now in fact that about him that pretty well took up the room
he was dressed in the garments of summer and save that his white waistcoat was redundant and bulging these things favoured they determined his expression
he wore a straw hat such as his friend hadn't yet seen in paris and he showed a buttonhole freshly adorned with a magnificent rose
strether read on the instant his storyhow astir for the previous hour the sprinkled newness of the day so pleasant at that season in paris he was fairly panting with the pulse of adventure and had been with mrs pocock unmistakeably to the marche aux fleurs
strether really knew in this vision of him a joy that was akin to envy so reversed as he stood there did their old positions seem so comparatively doleful now showed by the sharp turn of the wheel the posture of the pilgrim from woollett
he wondered this pilgrim if he had originally looked to waymarsh so brave and well so remarkably launched as it was at present the latter's privilege to appear
he recalled that his friend had remarked to him even at chester that his aspect belied his plea of prostration but there certainly couldn't have been for an issue an aspect less concerned than waymarsh's with the menace of decay
strether had at any rate never resembled a southern planter of the great dayswhich was the image picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between the fuliginous face and the wide panama of his visitor
this type it further amused him to guess had been on waymarsh's part the object of sarah's care he was convinced that her taste had not been a stranger to the conception and purchase of the hat any more than her fine fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose
it came to him in the current of thought as things so oddly did come that he had never risen with the lark to attend a brilliant woman to the marche aux fleurs this could be fastened on him in connexion neither with miss gostrey nor with madame de vionnet the practice of getting up early for adventures could indeed in no manner be fastened on him
it came to him in fact that just here was his usual case  he was for ever missing things through his general genius for missing them while others were for ever picking them up through a contrary bent
and it was others who looked abstemious and he who looked greedy it was he somehow who finally paid and it was others who mainly partook
yes he should go to the scaffold yet for he wouldn't know quite whom
he almost for that matter felt on the scaffold now and really quite enjoying it
it worked out as because he was anxious thereit worked out as for this reason that waymarsh was so blooming
it was his trip for health for a change that proved the successwhich was just what strether planning and exerting himself had desired it should be
that truth already sat fullblown on his companion's lips benevolence breathed from them as with the warmth of active exercise and also a little as with the bustle of haste
mrs pocock whom i left a quarter of an hour ago at her hotel has asked me to mention to you that she would like to find you at home here in about another hour
she wants to see you she has something to sayor considers i believe that you may have  so that i asked her myself why she shouldn't come right round
she hasn't been round yetto see our place and i took upon myself to say that i was sure you'd be glad to have her
the thing's therefore you see to keep right here till she comes
the announcement was sociably even though after waymarsh's wont somewhat solemnly made but strether quickly felt other things in it than these light features
it was the first approach from that quarter to admitted consciousness it quickened his pulse it simply meant at last that he should have but himself to thank if he didn't know where he was
he had finished his breakfast he pushed it away and was on his feet
there were plenty of elements of surprise but only one of doubt
the thing's for you to keep here too
waymarsh had been slightly ambiguous
he wasn't ambiguous however after this enquiry and strether's understanding had probably never before opened so wide and effective a mouth as it was to open during the next five minutes
it was no part of his friend's wish as appeared to help to receive mrs pocock he quite understood the spirit in which she was to present herself but his connexion with her visit was limited to his havingwell as he might sayperhaps a little promoted it
he had thought and had let her know it that strether possibly would think she might have been round before
at any rate as turned out she had been wanting herself quite a while to come
i told her said waymarsh that it would have been a bright idea if she had only carried it out before
strether pronounced it so bright as to be almost dazzling
but why hasn't she carried it out before
she has seen me every dayshe had only to name her hour
i've been waiting and waiting
well i told her you had
and she has been waiting too
it was in the oddest way in the world on the showing of this tone a genial new pressing coaxing waymarsh a waymarsh conscious with a different consciousness from any he had yet betrayed and actually rendered by it almost insinuating
he lacked only time for full persuasion and strether was to see in a moment why
meantime however our friend perceived he was announcing a step of some magnanimity on mrs pocock's part so that he could deprecate a sharp question
it was his own high purpose in fact to have smoothed sharp questions to rest
he looked his old comrade very straight in the eyes and he had never conveyed to him in so mute a manner so much kind confidence and so much good advice
everything that was between them was again in his face but matured and shelved and finally disposed of
at any rate he added she's coming now
considering how many pieces had to fit themselves it all fell in strether's brain into a close rapid order
he saw on the spot what had happened and what probably would yet and it was all funny enough
it was perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him up to his flare of high spirits
what is she coming forto kill me
she's coming to be very very kind to you and you must let me say that i greatly hope you'll not be less so to herself
this was spoken by waymarsh with much gravity of admonition and as strether stood there he knew he had but to make a movement to take the attitude of a man gracefully receiving a present
the present was that of the opportunity dear old waymarsh had flattered himself he had divined in him the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly enjoyed so he had brought it to him thus as on a little silver breakfasttray familiarly though delicatelywithout oppressive pomp and he was to bend and smile and acknowledge was to take and use and be grateful
he was notthat was the beauty of itto be asked to deflect too much from his dignity
no wonder the old boy bloomed in this bland air of his own distillation
strether felt for a moment as if sarah were actually walking up and down outside
wasn't she hanging about the portecochere while her friend thus summarily opened a way
strether would meet her but to take it and everything would be for the best in the best of possible worlds
he had never so much known what any one meant as in the light of this demonstration he knew what mrs newsome did
it had reached waymarsh from sarah but it had reached sarah from her mother and there was no break in the chain by which it reached him
has anything particular happened he asked after a minuteso suddenly to determine her
has she heard anything unexpected from home
waymarsh on this it seemed to him looked at him harder than ever
'unexpected'
he had a brief hesitation then however he was firm
we're leaving paris
leaving
that is sudden
waymarsh showed a different opinion
less so than it may seem
the purpose of mrs pocock's visit is to explain to you in fact that it's not
strether didn't at all know if he had really an advantageanything that would practically count as one but he enjoyed for the momentas for the first time in his lifethe sense of so carrying it off
he wonderedit was amusingif he felt as the impudent feel
i shall take great pleasure i assure you in any explanation
i shall be delighted to receive sarah
the sombre glow just darkened in his comrade's eyes but he was struck with the way it died out again
it was too mixed with another consciousnessit was too smothered as might be said in flowers
he really for the time regretted itpoor dear old sombre glow
something straight and simple something heavy and empty had been eclipsed in its company something by which he had best known his friend
waymarsh wouldn't be his friend somehow without the occasional ornament of the sacred rage and the right to the sacred rageinestimably precious for strether's charityhe also seemed in a manner and at mrs pocock's elbow to have forfeited
strether remembered the occasion early in their stay when on that very spot he had come out with his earnest his ominous quit it
and so remembering felt it hang by a hair that he didn't himself now utter the same note
waymarsh was having a good timethis was the truth that was embarrassing for him and he was having it then and there he was having it in europe he was having it under the very protection of circumstances of which he didn't in the least approve all of which placed him in a false position with no issue possiblenone at least by the grand manner
it was practically in the manner of any oneit was all but in poor strether's ownthat instead of taking anything up he merely made the most of having to be himself explanatory
i'm not leaving for the united states direct
mr and mrs pocock and miss mamie are thinking of a little trip before their own return and we've been talking for some days past of our joining forces
we've settled it that we do join and that we sail together the end of next month
but we start tomorrow for switzerland
mrs pocock wants some scenery
she hasn't had much yet
he was brave in his way too keeping nothing back confessing all there was and only leaving strether to make certain connexions
is what mrs newsome had cabled her daughter an injunction to break off short
the grand manner indeed at this just raised its head a little
i know nothing about mrs newsome's cables
their eyes met on it with some intensityduring the few seconds of which something happened quite out of proportion to the time
it happened that strether looking thus at his friend didn't take his answer for truthand that something more again occurred in consequence of that
yeswaymarsh just did know about mrs newsome's cables  to what other end than that had they dined together at bignon's
strether almost felt for the instant that it was to mrs newsome herself the dinner had been given and for that matter quite felt how she must have known about it and as he might think protected and consecrated it
he had a quick blurred view of daily cables questions answers signals  clear enough was his vision of the expense that when so wound up the lady at home was prepared to incur
vivid not less was his memory of what during his long observation of her some of her attainments of that high pitch had cost her
distinctly she was at the highest now and waymarsh who imagined himself an independent performer was really forcing his fine old natural voice an overstrained accompanist
the whole reference of his errand seemed to mark her for strether as by this time consentingly familiar to him and nothing yet had so despoiled her of a special shade of consideration
you don't know he asked whether sarah has been directed from home to try me on the matter of my also going to switzerland
i know said waymarsh as manfully as possible nothing whatever about her private affairs though i believe her to be acting in conformity with things that have my highest respect
it was as manful as possible but it was still the false noteas it had to be to convey so sorry a statement
he knew everything strether more and more felt that he thus disclaimed and his little punishment was just in this doom to a second fib
what falser positiongiven the mancould the most vindictive mind impose
he ended by squeezing through a passage in which three months before he would certainly have stuck fast
mrs pocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put to her
but he continued but
he faltered on it
but what
don't put her too many
waymarsh looked large but the harm was done he couldn't do what he would help looking rosy
don't do anything you'll be sorry for
it was an attenuation strether guessed of something else that had been on his lips it was a sudden drop to directness and was thereby the voice of sincerity
he had fallen to the supplicating note and that immediately for our friend made a difference and reinstated him
they were in communication as they had been that first morning in sarah's salon and in her presence and madame de vionnet's and the same recognition of a great good will was again after all possible
only the amount of response waymarsh had then taken for granted was doubled decupled now
this came out when he presently said  of course i needn't assure you i hope you'll come with us
then it was that his implications and expectations loomed up for strether as almost pathetically gross
the latter patted his shoulder while he thanked him giving the goby to the question of joining the pococks he expressed the joy he felt at seeing him go forth again so brave and free and he in fact almost took leave of him on the spot
i shall see you again of course before you go but i'm meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently for what you've told me
i shall walk up and down in the court theredear little old court which we've each bepaced so this last couple of months to the tune of our flights and our drops our hesitations and our plunges  i shall hang about there all impatience and excitement please let sarah know till she graciously presents herself
leave me with her without fear he laughed i assure you i shan't hurt her
i don't think either she'll hurt me  i'm in a situation in which damage was some time ago discounted
besides that isn't what worries youbut don't don't explain
we're all right as we are  which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for each of us
we weren't it seemed all right as we were before and we've got over the ground all things considered quickly
i hope you'll have a lovely time in the alps
waymarsh fairly looked up at him as from the foot of them
i don't know as i ought really to go
it was the conscience of milrose in the very voice of milrose but oh it was feeble and flat
strether suddenly felt quite ashamed for him he breathed a greater boldness
let yourself on the contrary goin all agreeable directions
these are precious hoursat our age they mayn't recur
don't have it to say to yourself at milrose next winter that you hadn't courage for them
and then as his comrade queerly stared  live up to mrs
pocock
live up to her
you're a great help to her
waymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were certainly true and that it was yet ironical to say
it's more then than you are
that's exactly your own chance and advantage
besides said strether i do in my way contribute
i know what i'm about
waymarsh had kept on his great panama and as he now stood nearer the door his last look beneath the shade of it had turned again to darkness and warning
so do i
see here strether
i know what you're going to say
'quit this'
quit this
but it lacked its old intensity nothing of it remained it went out of the room with him
iii   almost the first thing strangely enough that about an hour later strether found himself doing in sarah's presence was to remark articulately on this failure in their friend of what had been superficially his great distinction
it was as ifhe alluded of course to the grand mannerthe dear man had sacrificed it to some other advantage which would be of course only for himself to measure
it might be simply that he was physically so much more sound than on his first coming out this was all prosaic comparatively cheerful and vulgar
and fortunately if one came to that his improvement in health was really itself grander than any manner it could be conceived as having cost him
you yourself alone dear sarahstrether took the plungehave done him it strikes me in these three weeks as much good as all the rest of his time together
it was a plunge because somehow the range of reference was in the conditions funny and made funnier still by sarah's attitude by the turn the occasion had with her appearance so sensibly taken
her appearance was really indeed funnier than anything elsethe spirit in which he felt her to be there as soon as she was there the shade of obscurity that cleared up for him as soon as he was seated with her in the small salon de lecture that had for the most part in all the weeks witnessed the wane of his early vivacity of discussion with waymarsh
it was an immense thing quite a tremendous thing for her to have come  this truth opened out to him in spite of his having already arrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it
he had done exactly what he had given waymarsh his word forhad walked and rewalked the court while he awaited her advent acquiring in this exercise an amount of light that affected him at the time as flooding the scene
she had decided upon the step in order to give him the benefit of a doubt in order to be able to say to her mother that she had even to abjectness smoothed the way for him
the doubt had been as to whether he mightn't take her as not having smoothed itand the admonition had possibly come from waymarsh's more detached spirit
waymarsh had at any rate certainly thrown his weight into the scalehe had pointed to the importance of depriving their friend of a grievance
she had done justice to the plea and it was to set herself right with a high ideal that she actually sat there in her state
her calculation was sharp in the immobility with which she held her tall parasolstick upright and at arm's length quite as if she had struck the place to plant her flag in the separate precautions she took not to show as nervous in the aggressive repose in which she did quite nothing but wait for him
doubt ceased to be possible from the moment he had taken in that she had arrived with no proposal whatever that her concern was simply to show what she had come to receive
she had come to receive his submission and waymarsh was to have made it plain to him that she would expect nothing less
he saw fifty things her host at this convenient stage but one of those he most saw was that their anxious friend hadn't quite had the hand required of him
waymarsh had however uttered the request that she might find him mild and while hanging about the court before her arrival he had turned over with zeal the different ways in which he could be so
the difficulty was that if he was mild he wasn't for her purpose conscious
if she wished him consciousas everything about her cried aloud that she didshe must accordingly be at costs to make him so
conscious he was for himselfbut only of too many things so she must choose the one she required
practically however it at last got itself named and when once that had happened they were quite at the centre of their situation
one thing had really done as well as another when strether had spoken of waymarsh's leaving him and that had necessarily brought on a reference to mrs pocock's similar intention the jump was but short to supreme lucidity
light became indeed after that so intense that strether would doubtless have but half made out in the prodigious glare by which of the two the issue had been in fact precipitated
it was in their contracted quarters as much there between them as if it had been something suddenly spilled with a crash and a splash on the floor
the form of his submission was to be an engagement to acquit himself within the twentyfour hours
he'll go in a moment if you give him the wordhe assures me on his honour he'll do that  this came in its order out of its order in respect to chad after the crash had occurred
it came repeatedly during the time taken by strether to feel that he was even more fixed in his rigour than he had supposedthe time he was not above adding to a little by telling her that such a way of putting it on her brother's part left him sufficiently surprised
she wasn't at all funny at lastshe was really fine and he felt easily where she was strongstrong for herself
it hadn't yet so come home to him that she was nobly and appointedly officious
she was acting in interests grander and clearer than that of her poor little personal poor little parisian equilibrium and all his consciousness of her mother's moral pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining force
she would be held up she would be strengthened he needn't in the least be anxious for her
what would once more have been distinct to him had he tried to make it so was that as mrs newsome was essentially all moral pressure the presence of this element was almost identical with her own presence
it wasn't perhaps that he felt he was dealing with her straight but it was certainly as if she had been dealing straight with him
she was reaching him somehow by the lengthened arm of the spirit and he was having to that extent to take her into account but he wasn't reaching her in turn not making her take him he was only reaching sarah who appeared to take so little of him
something has clearly passed between you and chad he presently said that i think i ought to know something more about
does he put it all he smiled on me
did you come out she asked to put it all on him
but he replied to this no further than after an instant by saying oh it's all right
chad i mean's all right in having said to youwell anything he may have said
i'll take it allwhat he does put on me
only i must see him before i see you again
she hesitated but she brought it out
is it absolutely necessary you should see me again
certainly if i'm to give you any definite word about anything
is it your idea then she returned that i shall keep on meeting you only to be exposed to fresh humiliation
he fixed her a longer time
are your instructions from mrs newsome that you shall even at the worst absolutely and irretrievably break with me
my instructions from mrs newsome are if you please my affair
you know perfectly what your own were and you can judge for yourself of what it can do for you to have made what you have of them
you can perfectly see at any rate i'll go so far as to say that if i wish not to expose myself i must wish still less to expose her
she had already said more than she had quite expected but though she had also pulled up the colour in her face showed him he should from one moment to the other have it all
he now indeed felt the high importance of his having it
what is your conduct she broke out as if to explainwhat is your conduct but an outrage to women like us
i mean your acting as if there can be a doubtas between us and such anotherof his duty
he thought a moment
it was rather much to deal with at once not only the question itself but the sore abysses it revealed
of course they're totally different kinds of duty
and do you pretend that he has any at allto such another
do you mean to madame de vionnet
he uttered the name not to affront her but yet again to gain timetime that he needed for taking in something still other and larger than her demand of a moment before
it wasn't at once that he could see all that was in her actual challenge but when he did he found himself just checking a low vague sound a sound which was perhaps the nearest approach his vocal chords had ever known to a growl
everything mrs pocock had failed to give a sign of recognising in chad as a particular part of a transformationeverything that had lent intention to this particular failureaffected him as gathered into a large loose bundle and thrown in her words into his face
the missile made him to that extent catch his breath which however he presently recovered
why when a woman's at once so charming and so beneficent  you can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a blush and can make them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you the straighter how you do it
yes she had taken him up as short and as sharply as that but he tried not to flounder in her grasp
i don't think there's anything i've done in any such calculated way as you describe
everything has come as a sort of indistinguishable part of everything else
your coming out belonged closely to my having come before you and my having come was a result of our general state of mind
our general state of mind had proceeded on its side from our queer ignorance our queer misconceptions and confusionsfrom which since then an inexorable tide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer knowledge
don't you like your brother as he is he went on and haven't you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that comes to
it put to her also doubtless his own tone too many things this at least would have been the case hadn't his final challenge directly helped her
everything at the stage they had reached directly helped her because everything betrayed in him such a basis of intention
he sawthe odd way things came outthat he would have been held less monstrous had he only been a little wilder
what exposed him was just his poor old trick of quiet inwardness what exposed him was his thinking such offence
he hadn't in the least however the desire to irritate that sarah imputed to him and he could only at last temporise for the moment with her indignant view
she was altogether more inflamed than he had expected and he would probably understand this better when he should learn what had occurred for her with chad
till then her view of his particular blackness her clear surprise at his not clutching the pole she held out must pass as extravagant
i leave you to flatter yourself she returned that what you speak of is what you've beautifully done
when a thing has been already described in such a lovely way
but she caught herself up and her comment on his description rang out sufficiently loud
do you consider her even an apology for a decent woman
ah there it was at last
she put the matter more crudely than for his own mixed purposes he had yet had to do but essentially it was all one matter
it was so muchso much and she treated it poor lady as so little
he grew conscious as he was now apt to do of a strange smile and the next moment he found himself talking like miss barrace
she has struck me from the first as wonderful
i've been thinking too moreover that after all she would probably have represented even for yourself something rather new and rather good
he was to have given mrs pocock with this however but her best opportunity for a sound of derision
rather new
i hope so with all my heart
i mean he explained that she might have affected you by her exquisite amiabilitya real revelation it has seemed to myself her high rarity her distinction of every sort
he had been with these words consciously a little precious but he had had to behe couldn't give her the truth of the case without them and it seemed to him moreover now that he didn't care
he had at all events not served his cause for she sprang at its exposed side
a 'revelation'to me  i've come to such a woman for a revelation
you talk to me about 'distinction'you you who've had your privilegewhen the most distinguished woman we shall either of us have seen in this world sits there insulted in her loneliness by your incredible comparison
strether forbore with an effort from straying but he looked all about him
does your mother herself make the point that she sits insulted
sarah's answer came so straight so pat as might have been said that he felt on the instant its origin
she has confided to my judgement and my tenderness the expression of her personal sense of everything and the assertion of her personal dignity
they were the very words of the lady of woolletthe would have known them in a thousand her parting charge to her child
mrs pocock accordingly spoke to this extent by book and the fact immensely moved him
if she does really feel as you say it's of course very very dreadful
i've given sufficient proof one would have thought he added of my deep admiration for mrs
newsome
and pray what proof would one have thought you'd call sufficient
that of thinking this person here so far superior to her
he wondered again he waited
ah dear sarah you must leave me this person here
in his desire to avoid all vulgar retorts to show how even perversely he clung to his rag of reason he had softly almost wailed this plea
yet he knew it to be perhaps the most positive declaration he had ever made in his life and his visitor's reception of it virtually gave it that importance
that's exactly what i'm delighted to do
god knows we don't want her
you take good care not to meet she observed in a still higher key my question about their life
if you do consider it a thing one can even speak of i congratulate you on your taste
the life she alluded to was of course chad's and madame de vionnet's which she thus bracketed together in a way that made him wince a little there being nothing for him but to take home her full intention
it was none the less his inconsequence that while he had himself been enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant woman's specific action he just suffered from any characterisation of it by other lips
i think tremendously well of her at the same time that i seem to feel her 'life' to be really none of my business
it's my business that is only so far as chad's own life is affected by it and what has happened don't you see
is that chad's has been affected so beautifully
the proof of the pudding's in the eatinghe tried with no great success to help it out with a touch of pleasantry while she let him go on as if to sink and sink
he went on however well enough as well as he could do without fresh counsel he indeed shouldn't stand quite firm he felt till he should have reestablished his communications with chad
still he could always speak for the woman he had so definitely promised to save
this wasn't quite for her the air of salvation but as that chill fairly deepened what did it become but a reminder that one might at the worst perish with her
and it was simple enoughit was rudimentary  not not to give her away
i find in her more merits than you would probably have patience with my counting over
and do you know he enquired the effect you produce on me by alluding to her in such terms
it's as if you had some motive in not recognising all she has done for your brother and so shut your eyes to each side of the matter in order whichever side comes up to get rid of the other
i don't you must allow me to say see how you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side nearest you
near methat sort of thing
and sarah gave a jerk back of her head that well might have nullified any active proximity
it kept her friend himself at his distance and he respected for a moment the interval
then with a last persuasive effort he bridged it
you don't on your honour appreciate chad's fortunate development
fortunate
she echoed again
and indeed she was prepared
i call it hideous
her departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent and she was already at the door that stood open to the court from the threshold of which she delivered herself of this judgement
it rang out so loud as to produce for the time the hush of everything else
strether quite as an effect of it breathed less bravely he could acknowledge it but simply enough
oh if you think that
then all's at an end
so much the better
i do think that
she passed out as she spoke and took her way straight across the court beyond which separated from them by the deep arch of the portecochere the low victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up
she made for it with decision and the manner of her break the sharp shaft of her rejoinder had an intensity by which strether was at first kept in arrest
she had let fly at him as from a stretched cord and it took him a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced
it was not the penetration of surprise it was that much more of certainty his case being put for him as he had as yet only put it to himself
she was away at any rate she had distanced himwith rather a grand spring an effect of pride and ease after all she had got into her carriage before he could overtake her and the vehicle was already in motion
he stopped halfway he stood there in the court only seeing her go and noting that she gave him no other look
the way he had put it to himself was that all quite might be at an end
each of her movements in this resolute rupture reaffirmed reenforced that idea
sarah passed out of sight in the sunny street while planted there in the centre of the comparatively grey court he continued merely to look before him
it probably was all at an end
book eleventh  note  in the  new york edition the following two chapters were placed in the reverse of the order appearing below
since  most scholars have agreed because of the internal evidence of the two chapters that an editorial error caused them to be printed in reverse order
this etext like other editions of the past four decades corrects the apparent errorrichard d hathaway preparer of this electronic text     i   he went late that evening to the boulevard malesherbes having his impression that it would be vain to go early and having also more than once in the course of the day made enquiries of the concierge
chad hadn't come in and had left no intimation he had affairs apparently at this junctureas it occurred to strether he so well might havethat kept him long abroad
our friend asked once for him at the hotel in the rue de rivoli but the only contribution offered there was the fact that every one was out
it was with the idea that he would have to come home to sleep that strether went up to his rooms from which however he was still absent though from the balcony a few moments later his visitor heard eleven o'clock strike
chad's servant had by this time answered for his reappearance he had the visitor learned come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again
strether spent an hour in waiting for himan hour full of strange suggestions persuasions recognitions one of those that he was to recall at the end of his adventure as the particular handful that most had counted
the mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his disposal by baptiste subtlest of servants the novel halfuncut the novel lemoncoloured and tender with the ivory knife athwart it like the dagger in a contadina's hair had been pushed within the soft circlea circle which for some reason affected strether as softer still after the same baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a further need of anything by monsieur he would betake himself to bed
the night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient the great flare of the lighted city rising high spending itself afar played up from the boulevard and through the vague vista of the successive rooms brought objects into view and added to their dignity
strether found himself in possession as he never yet had been he had been there alone had turned over books and prints had invoked in chad's absence the spirit of the place but never at the witching hour and never with a relish quite so like a pang
he spent a long time on the balcony he hung over it as he had seen little bilham hang the day of his first approach as he had seen mamie hang over her own the day little bilham himself might have seen her from below he passed back into the rooms the three that occupied the front and that communicated by wide doors and while he circulated and rested tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three months before to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then to speak to him
that voice he had to note failed audibly to sound which he took as the proof of all the change in himself
he had heard of old only what he could then hear what he could do now was to think of three months ago as a point in the far past
all voices had grown thicker and meant more things they crowded on him as he moved aboutit was the way they sounded together that wouldn't let him be still
he felt strangely as sad as if he had come for some wrong and yet as excited as if he had come for some freedom
but the freedom was what was most in the place and the hour it was the freedom that most brought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago missed
he could have explained little enough today either why he had missed it or why after years and years he should care that he had the main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less that everything represented the substance of his loss put it within reach within touch made it to a degree it had never been an affair of the senses
that was what it became for him at this singular time the youth he had long ago misseda queer concrete presence full of mystery yet full of reality which he could handle taste smell the deep breathing of which he could positively hear
it was in the outside air as well as within it was in the long watch from the balcony in the summer night of the wide late life of paris the unceasing soft quick rumble below of the little lighted carriages that in the press always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at monte carlo pushing up to the tables
this image was before him when he at last became aware that chad was behind
she tells me you put it all on mehe had arrived after this promptly enough at that information which expressed the case however quite as the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it
other things with this advantage of their virtually having the night before them came up for them and had as well the odd effect of making the occasion instead of hurried and feverish one of the largest loosest and easiest to which strether's whole adventure was to have treated him
he had been pursuing chad from an early hour and had overtaken him only now but now the delay was repaired by their being so exceptionally confronted
they had foregathered enough of course in all the various times they had again and again since that first night at the theatre been face to face over their question but they had never been so alone together as they were actually alonetheir talk hadn't yet been so supremely for themselves
and if many things moreover passed before them none passed more distinctly for strether than that striking truth about chad of which he had been so often moved to take note  the truth that everything came happily back with him to his knowing how to live
it had been seated in his pleased smilea smile that pleased exactly in the right degreeas his visitor turned round on the balcony to greet his advent his visitor in fact felt on the spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear witness to that facility
he surrendered himself accordingly to so approved a gift for what was the meaning of the facility but that others did surrender themselves
he didn't want luckily to prevent chad from living but he was quite aware that even if he had he would himself have thoroughly gone to pieces
it was in truth essentially by bringing down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the young man's own that he held together
and the great point above all the sign of how completely chad possessed the knowledge in question was that one thus became not only with a proper cheerfulness but with wild native impulses the feeder of his stream
their talk had accordingly not lasted three minutes without strether's feeling basis enough for the excitement in which he had waited
this overflow fairly deepened wastefully abounded as he observed the smallness of anything corresponding to it on the part of his friend
that was exactly this friend's happy case he put out his excitement or whatever other emotion the matter involved as he put out his washing than which no arrangement could make more for domestic order
it was quite for strether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress bringing home the triumphs of the mangle
when he had reported on sarah's visit which he did very fully chad answered his question with perfect candour
i positively referred her to youtold her she must absolutely see you
this was last night and it all took place in ten minutes
it was our first free talkreally the first time she had tackled me
she knew i also knew what her line had been with yourself knew moreover how little you had been doing to make anything difficult for her
so i spoke for you franklyassured her you were all at her service
i assured her i was too the young man continued and i pointed out how she could perfectly at any time have got at me
her difficulty has been simply her not finding the moment she fancied
her difficulty strether returned has been simply that she finds she's afraid of you
she's not afraid of me sarah one little scrap and it was just because she has seen how i can fidget when i give my mind to it that she has felt her best chance rightly enough to be in making me as uneasy as possible
i think she's at bottom as pleased to have you put it on me as you yourself can possibly be to put it
but what in the world my dear man chad enquired in objection to this luminosity have i done to make sally afraid
you've been 'wonderful wonderful' as we saywe poor people who watch the play from the pit and that's what has admirably made her
made her all the more effectually that she could see you didn't set about it on purposei mean set about affecting her as with fear
chad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive
i've only wanted to be kind and friendly to be decent and attentiveand i still only want to be
strether smiled at his comfortable clearness
well there can certainly be no way for it better than by my taking the onus
it reduces your personal friction and your personal offence to almost nothing
ah but chad with his completer conception of the friendly wouldn't quite have this
they had remained on the balcony where after their day of great and premature heat the midnight air was delicious and they leaned back in turn against the balustrade all in harmony with the chairs and the flowerpots the cigarettes and the starlight
the onus isn't really yoursafter our agreeing so to wait together and judge together
that was all my answer to sally chad pursuedthat we have been that we are just judging together
i'm not afraid of the burden strether explained i haven't come in the least that you should take it off me
i've come very much it seems to me to double up my fore legs in the manner of the camel when he gets down on his knees to make his back convenient
but i've supposed you all this while to have been doing a lot of special and private judgingabout which i haven't troubled you and i've only wished to have your conclusion first from you
i don't ask more than that i'm quite ready to take it as it has come
chad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of his smoke
well i've seen
strether waited a little
i've left you wholly alone haven't i think i may say since the first hour or twowhen i merely preached patienceso much as breathed on you
oh you've been awfully good
we've both been good thenwe've played the game
we've given them the most liberal conditions
ah said chad splendid conditions
it was open to them open to themhe seemed to make it out as he smoked with his eyes still on the stars
he might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope
strether wondered meanwhile what had been open to them and he finally let him have it
it was open to them simply to let me alone to have made up their minds on really seeing me for themselves that i could go on well enough as i was
strether assented to this proposition with full lucidity his companion's plural pronoun which stood all for mrs newsome and her daughter having no ambiguity for him
there was nothing apparently to stand for mamie and jim and this added to our friend's sense of chad's knowing what he thought
but they've made up their minds to the oppositethat you can't go on as you are
no chad continued in the same way they won't have it for a minute
strether on his side also reflectively smoked
it was as if their high place really represented some moral elevation from which they could look down on their recent past
there never was the smallest chance do you know that they would have it for a moment
of course notno real chance
but if they were willing to think there was
they weren't willing
strether had worked it all out
it wasn't for you they came out but for me
it wasn't to see for themselves what you're doing but what i'm doing
the first branch of their curiosity was inevitably destined under my culpable delay to give way to the second and it's on the second that if i may use the expression and you don't mind my marking the invidious fact they've been of late exclusively perched
when sarah sailed it was me in other words they were after
chad took it in both with intelligence and with indulgence
it is rather a business thenwhat i've let you in for
strether had again a brief pause which ended in a reply that seemed to dispose once for all of this element of compunction
chad was to treat it at any rate so far as they were again together as having done so
i was 'in' when you found me
ah but it was you the young man laughed who found me
i only found you out
it was you who found me in
it was all in the day's work for them at all events that they should come
and they've greatly enjoyed it strether declared
well i've tried to make them said chad
his companion did himself presently the same justice
so have i i tried even this very morningwhile mrs pocock was with me
she enjoys for instance almost as much as anything else not being as i've said afraid of me and i think i gave her help in that
chad took a deeper interest
was she very very nasty
strether debated
well she was the most important thingshe was definite
she wasat lastcrystalline
and i felt no remorse
i saw that they must have come
oh i wanted to see them for myself so that if it were only for that
chad's own remorse was as small
this appeared almost all strether wanted
isn't your having seen them for yourself then the thing beyond all others that has come of their visit
chad looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to put it so
don't you count it as anything that you're dishedif you are dished
are you my dear man dished
it sounded as if he were asking if he had caught cold or hurt his foot and strether for a minute but smoked and smoked
i want to see her again
i must see her
of course you must
then chad hesitated
do you meanamother herself
oh your motherthat will depend
it was as if mrs newsome had somehow been placed by the words very far off
chad however endeavoured in spite of this to reach the place
what do you mean it will depend on
strether for all answer gave him a longish look
i was speaking of sarah
i must positivelythough she quite cast me offsee her again
i can't part with her that way
then she was awfully unpleasant
again strether exhaled
she was what she had to be
i mean that from the moment they're not delighted they can only bewell what i admit she was
we gave them he went on their chance to be delighted and they've walked up to it and looked all round it and not taken it
you can bring a horse to water
chad suggested
precisely
and the tune to which this morning sarah wasn't delightedthe tune to which to adopt your metaphor she refused to drinkleaves us on that side nothing more to hope
chad had a pause and then as if consolingly  it was never of course really the least on the cards that they would be 'delighted'
well i don't know after all strether mused
i've had to come as far round
howeverhe shook it offit's doubtless my performance that's absurd
there are certainly moments said chad when you seem to me too good to be true
yet if you are true he added that seems to be all that need concern me
i'm true but i'm incredible
i'm fantastic and ridiculousi don't explain myself even to myself
how can they then strether asked understand me
so i don't quarrel with them
i see
they quarrel said chad rather comfortably with us
strether noted once more the comfort but his young friend had already gone on
i should feel greatly ashamed all the same if i didn't put it before you again that you ought to think after all tremendously well
i mean before giving up beyond recall with which insistence as from a certain delicacy dropped
ah but strether wanted it
say it all say it all
well at your age and with whatwhen all's said and donemother might do for you and be for you
chad had said it all from his natural scruple only to that extent so that strether after an instant himself took a hand
my absence of an assured future
the little i have to show toward the power to take care of myself
the way the wonderful way she would certainly take care of me
her fortune her kindness and the constant miracle of her having been disposed to go even so far
of course of coursehe summed it up
there are those sharp facts
chad had meanwhile thought of another still
and don't you really care
his friend slowly turned round to him
will you go
i'll go if you'll say you now consider i should
you know he went on i was ready six weeks ago
ah said strether that was when you didn't know i wasn't
you're ready at present because you do know it
that may be chad returned but all the same i'm sincere
you talk about taking the whole thing on your shoulders but in what light do you regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay
strether patted his arm as they stood together against the parapet reassuringlyseeming to wish to contend that he had the wherewithal but it was again round this question of purchase and price that the young man's sense of fairness continued to hover
what it literally comes to for you if you'll pardon my putting it so is that you give up money
possibly a good deal of money
oh strether laughed if it were only just enough you'd still be justified in putting it so
but i've on my side to remind you too that you give up money and more than 'possibly'quite certainly as i should supposea good deal
true enough but i've got a certain quantity chad returned after a moment
whereas you my dear man you  i can't be at all saidstrether took him upto have a 'quantity' certain or uncertain
very true
still i shan't starve
oh you mustn't starve
chad pacifically emphasised and so in the pleasant conditions they continued to talk though there was for that matter a pause in which the younger companion might have been taken as weighing again the delicacy of his then and there promising the elder some provision against the possibility just mentioned
this however he presumably thought best not to do for at the end of another minute they had moved in quite a different direction
strether had broken in by returning to the subject of chad's passage with sarah and enquiring if they had arrived in the event at anything in the nature of a scene
to this chad replied that they had on the contrary kept tremendously polite adding moreover that sally was after all not the woman to have made the mistake of not being
her hands are a good deal tied you see
i got so from the first he sagaciously observed the start of her
you mean she has taken so much from you
well i couldn't of course in common decency give less  only she hadn't expected i think that i'd give her nearly so much
and she began to take it before she knew it
and she began to like it said strether as soon as she began to take it
yes she has liked italso more than she expected
after which chad observed  but she doesn't like me
in fact she hates me
strether's interest grew
then why does she want you at home
because when you hate you want to triumph and if she should get me neatly stuck there she would triumph
strether followed afresh but looking as he went
certainlyin a manner
but it would scarce be a triumph worth having if once entangled feeling her dislike and possibly conscious in time of a certain quantity of your own you should on the spot make yourself unpleasant to her
ah said chad she can bear mecould bear me at least at home
it's my being there that would be her triumph
she hates me in paris
she hates in other words  yes that's it
chad had quickly understood this understanding which formed on the part of each as near an approach as they had yet made to naming madame de vionnet
the limitations of their distinctness didn't however prevent its fairly lingering in the air that it was this lady mrs pocock hated
it added one more touch moreover to their established recognition of the rare intimacy of chad's association with her
he had never yet more twitched away the last light veil from this phenomenon than in presenting himself as confounded and submerged in the feeling she had created at woollett
and i'll tell you who hates me too he immediately went on
strether knew as immediately whom he meant but with as prompt a protest
ah no
mamie doesn't hatewell he caught himself in timeanybody at all
mamie's beautiful
chad shook his head
that's just why i mind it
she certainly doesn't like me
how much do you mind it
what would you do for her
well i'd like her if she'd like me
really really chad declared
it gave his companion a moment's pause
you asked me just now if i don't as you said 'care' about a certain person
you rather tempt me therefore to put the question in my turn
don't you care about a certain other person
chad looked at him hard in the lamplight of the window
the difference is that i don't want to
strether wondered
'don't want' to
i try not tothat is i have tried
i've done my best
you can't be surprised the young man easily went on when you yourself set me on it
i was indeed he added already on it a little but you set me harder
it was six weeks ago that i thought i had come out
strether took it well in
but you haven't come out
i don't knowit's what i want to know said chad
and if i could have sufficiently wantedby myselfto go back i think i might have found out
possiblystrether considered
but all you were able to achieve was to want to want to
and even then he pursued only till our friends there came
do you want to want to still
as with a sound halfdolorous halfdroll and all vague and equivocal chad buried his face for a little in his hands rubbing it in a whimsical way that amounted to an evasion he brought it out more sharply  do you
chad kept for a time his attitude but at last he looked up and then abruptly jim is a damned dose
he declared
oh i don't ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on your relatives i simply put it to you once more whether you're now ready
you say you've 'seen'
is what you've seen that you can't resist
chad gave him a strange smilethe nearest approach he had ever shown to a troubled one
can't you make me not resist
what it comes to strether went on very gravely now and as if he hadn't heard him what it comes to is that more has been done for you i think than i've ever seen doneattempted perhaps but never so successfully doneby one human being for another
oh an immense deal certainlychad did it full justice
and you yourself are adding to it
it was without heeding this either that his visitor continued
and our friends there won't have it
no they simply won't
they demand you on the basis as it were of repudiation and ingratitude and what has been the matter with me strether went on is that i haven't seen my way to working with you for repudiation
chad appreciated this
then as you haven't seen yours you naturally haven't seen mine
there it is
after which he proceeded with a certain abruptness to a sharp interrogation
now do you say she doesn't hate me
strether hesitated
'she'
yesmother
we called it sarah but it comes to the same thing
ah strether objected not to the same thing as her hating you
on whichthough as if for an instant it had hung firechad remarkably replied  well if they hate my good friend that comes to the same thing
it had a note of inevitable truth that made strether take it as enough feel he wanted nothing more
the young man spoke in it for his good friend more than he had ever yet directly spoken confessed to such deep identities between them as he might play with the idea of working free from but which at a given moment could still draw him down like a whirlpool
and meanwhile he had gone on
their hating you too moreoverthat also comes to a good deal
ah said strether your mother doesn't
chad however loyally stuck to itloyally that is to strether
she will if you don't look out
well i do look out
i am after all looking out
that's just why our friend explained i want to see her again
it drew from chad again the same question
to see mother
to seefor the presentsarah
ah then there you are
and what i don't for the life of me make out chad pursued with resigned perplexity is what you gain by it
oh it would have taken his companion too long to say
that's because you have i verily believe no imagination
you've other qualities
but no imagination don't you see
at all
i dare say
i do see
it was an idea in which chad showed interest
but haven't you yourself rather too much
oh rather
so that after an instant under this reproach and as if it were at last a fact really to escape from strether made his move for departure
ii   one of the features of the restless afternoon passed by him after mrs pocock's visit was an hour spent shortly before dinner with maria gostrey whom of late in spite of so sustained a call on his attention from other quarters he had by no means neglected
and that he was still not neglecting her will appear from the fact that he was with her again at the same hour on the very morrowwith no less fine a consciousness moreover of being able to hold her ear
it continued inveterately to occur for that matter that whenever he had taken one of his greater turns he came back to where she so faithfully awaited him
none of these excursions had on the whole been livelier than the pair of incidentsthe fruit of the short interval since his previous visiton which he had now to report to her
he had seen chad newsome late the night before and he had had that morning as a sequel to this conversation a second interview with sarah
but they're all off he said at last
it puzzled her a moment
allmr
newsome with them
ah not yet
sarah and jim and mamie
but waymarsh with themfor sarah
it's too beautiful strether continued i find i don't get over thatit's always a fresh joy
but it's a fresh joy too he added thatwell what do you think
little bilham also goes
but he of course goes for mamie
miss gostrey wondered
'for' her
do you mean they're already engaged
well said strether say then for me
he'll do anything for me just as i will for that matteranything i canfor him
or for mamie either
she'll do anything for me
miss gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh
the way you reduce people to subjection
it's certainly on one side wonderful
but it's quite equalled on another by the way i don't
i haven't reduced sarah since yesterday though i've succeeded in seeing her again as i'll presently tell you
the others however are really all right
mamie by that blessed law of ours absolutely must have a young man
but what must poor mr bilham have
do you mean they'll marry for you
i mean that by the same blessed law it won't matter a grain if they don'ti shan't have in the least to worry
she saw as usual what he meant
and mr
jimwho goes for him
oh strether had to admit i couldn't manage that
he's thrown as usual on the world the world which after all by his accountfor he has prodigious adventuresseems very good to him
he fortunately'over here' as he saysfinds the world everywhere and his most prodigious adventure of all he went on has been of course of the last few days
miss gostrey already knowing instantly made the connexion
he has seen marie de vionnet again
he went all by himself the day after chad's partydidn't i tell youto tea with her
by her invitationall alone
quite like yourself
maria smiled
oh but he's more wonderful about her than i am
and then as his friend showed how she could believe it filling it out fitting it on to old memories of the wonderful woman  what i should have liked to manage would have been her going
to switzerland with the party
for jimand for symmetry
if it had been workable moreover for a fortnight she'd have gone
she's readyhe followed up his renewed vision of herfor anything
miss gostrey went with him a minute
she's too perfect
she will i think he pursued go tonight to the station
to see him off
with chadmarvellouslyas part of their general attention
and she does itit kept before himwith a light light grace a free free gaiety that may well softly bewilder mr
pocock
it kept her so before him that his companion had after an instant a friendly comment
as in short it has softly bewildered a saner man
are you really in love with her
maria threw off
it's of no importance i should know he replied
it matters so littlehas nothing to do practically with either of us
all the samemaria continued to smilethey go the five as i understand you and you and madame de vionnet stay
oh and chad
to which strether added  and you
ah 'me'
she gave a small impatient wail again in which something of the unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out
i don't stay it somehow seems to me much to my advantage
in the presence of all you cause to pass before me i've a tremendous sense of privation
strether hesitated
but your privation your keeping out of everything has beenhasn't itby your own choice
oh yes it has been necessarythat is it has been better for you
what i mean is only that i seem to have ceased to serve you
how can you tell that
he asked
you don't know how you serve me
when you cease  well
she said as he dropped
well i'll let you know
be quiet till then
she thought a moment
then you positively like me to stay
don't i treat you as if i did
you're certainly very kind to me
but that said maria is for myself
it's getting late as you see and paris turning rather hot and dusty
people are scattering and some of them in other places want me
but if you want me here
she had spoken as resigned to his word but he had of a sudden a still sharper sense than he would have expected of desiring not to lose her
i want you here
she took it as if the words were all she had wished as if they brought her gave her something that was the compensation of her case
thank you she simply answered
and then as he looked at her a little harder thank you very much she repeated
it had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk and it held him a moment longer
why two months or whatever the time was ago did you so suddenly dash off
the reason you afterwards gave me for having kept away three weeks wasn't the real one
she recalled
i never supposed you believed it was
yet she continued if you didn't guess it that was just what helped you
he looked away from her on this he indulged so far as space permitted in one of his slow absences
i've often thought of it but never to feel that i could guess it
and you see the consideration with which i've treated you in never asking till now
now then why do you ask
to show you how i miss you when you're not here and what it does for me
it doesn't seem to have done she laughed all it might
however she added if you've really never guessed the truth i'll tell it you
i've never guessed it strether declared
never
never
well then i dashed off as you say so as not to have the confusion of being there if marie de vionnet should tell you anything to my detriment
he looked as if he considerably doubted
you even then would have had to face it on your return
oh if i had found reason to believe it something very bad i'd have left you altogether
so then he continued it was only on guessing she had been on the whole merciful that you ventured back
maria kept it together
i owe her thanks
whatever her temptation she didn't separate us
that's one of my reasons she went on for admiring her so
let it pass then said strether for one of mine as well
but what would have been her temptation
what are ever the temptations of women
he thoughtbut hadn't naturally to think too long
men
she would have had you with it more for herself
but she saw she could have you without it
oh 'have' me
strether a trifle ambiguously sighed
you he handsomely declared would have had me at any rate with it
oh 'have' you
she echoed it as he had done
i do have you however she less ironically said from the moment you express a wish
he stopped before her full of the disposition
i'll express fifty
which indeed begot in her with a certain inconsequence a return of her small wail
ah there you are
there if it were so he continued for the rest of the time to be and it was as if to show her how she could still serve him that coming back to the departure of the pococks he gave her the view vivid with a hundred more touches than we can reproduce of what had happened for him that morning
he had had ten minutes with sarah at her hotel ten minutes reconquered by irresistible pressure from the time over which he had already described her to miss gostrey as having at the end of their interview on his own premises passed the great sponge of the future
he had caught her by not announcing himself had found her in her sittingroom with a dressmaker and a lingere whose accounts she appeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon withdrew
then he had explained to her how he had succeeded late the night before in keeping his promise of seeing chad
i told her i'd take it all
you'd 'take' it
why if he doesn't go
maria waited
and who takes it if he does
she enquired with a certain grimness of gaiety
well said strether i think i take in any event everything
by which i suppose you mean his companion brought out after a moment that you definitely understand you now lose everything
he stood before her again
it does come perhaps to the same thing
but chad now that he has seen doesn't really want it
she could believe that but she made as always for clearness
still what after all has he seen
what they want of him
and it's enough
it contrasts so unfavourably with what madame de vionnet wants
it contrastsjust so all round and tremendously
therefore perhaps most of all with what you want
oh said strether what i want is a thing i've ceased to measure or even to understand
but his friend none the less went on
do you want mrs newsomeafter such a way of treating you
it was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as yetsuch was their high formpermitted themselves but it seemed not wholly for this that he delayed a moment
i dare say it has been after all the only way she could have imagined
and does that make you want her any more
i've tremendously disappointed her strether thought it worth while to mention
of course you have
that's rudimentary that was plain to us long ago
but isn't it almost as plain maria went on that you've even yet your straight remedy
really drag him away as i believe you still can and you'd cease to have to count with her disappointment
ah then he laughed i should have to count with yours
but this barely struck her now
what in that case should you call counting
you haven't come out where you are i think to please me
oh he insisted that too you know has been part of it
i can't separateit's all one and that's perhaps why as i say i don't understand
but he was ready to declare again that this didn't in the least matter all the more that as he affirmed he hadn't really as yet come out
she gives me after all on its coming to the pinch a last mercy another chance
they don't sail you see for five or six weeks more and they haven'tshe admits thatexpected chad would take part in their tour
it's still open to him to join them at the last at liverpool
miss gostrey considered
how in the world is it 'open' unless you open it
how can he join them at liverpool if he but sinks deeper into his situation here
he has given heras i explained to you that she let me know yesterdayhis word of honour to do as i say
maria stared
but if you say nothing
well he as usual walked about on it
i did say something this morning
i gave her my answerthe word i had promised her after hearing from himself what he had promised
what she demanded of me yesterday you'll remember was the engagement then and there to make him take up this vow
well then miss gostrey enquired was the purpose of your visit to her only to decline
no it was to ask odd as that may seem to you for another delay
ah that's weak
precisely
she had spoken with impatience but so far as that at least he knew where he was
if i am weak i want to find it out
if i don't find it out i shall have the comfort the little glory of thinking i'm strong
it's all the comfort i judge she returned that you will have
at any rate he said it will have been a month more
paris may grow from day to day hot and dusty as you say but there are other things that are hotter and dustier
i'm not afraid to stay on the summer here must be amusing in a wildif it isn't a tameway of its own the place at no time more picturesque
i think i shall like it
and then he benevolently smiled for her there will be always you
oh she objected it won't be as a part of the picturesqueness that i shall stay for i shall be the plainest thing about you
you may you see at any rate she pursued have nobody else
madame de vionnet may very well be going off mayn't sheand mr newsome by the same stroke  unless indeed you've had an assurance from them to the contrary
so that if your idea's to stay for themit was her duty to suggest ityou may be left in the lurch
of course if they do stayshe kept it upthey would be part of the picturesqueness
or else indeed you might join them somewhere
strether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought but the next moment he spoke more critically
do you mean that they'll probably go off together
she just considered
i think it will be treating you quite without ceremony if they do though after all she added it would be difficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your case
of course strether conceded my attitude toward them is extraordinary
just so so that one may ask one's self what style of proceeding on their own part can altogether match it
the attitude of their own that won't pale in its light they've doubtless still to work out
the really handsome thing perhaps she presently threw off would be for them to withdraw into more secluded conditions offering at the same time to share them with you
he looked at her on this as if some generous irritationall in his interesthad suddenly again flickered in her and what she next said indeed halfexplained it
don't really be afraid to tell me if what now holds you is the pleasant prospect of the empty town with plenty of seats in the shade cool drinks deserted museums drives to the bois in the evening and our wonderful woman all to yourself
and she kept it up still more
the handsomest thing of all when one makes it out would i dare say be that mr chad should for a while go off by himself
it's a pity from that point of view she wound up that he doesn't pay his mother a visit
it would at least occupy your interval
the thought in fact held her a moment
why doesn't he pay his mother a visit
even a week at this good moment would do
my dear lady strether repliedand he had it even to himself surprisingly readymy dear lady his mother has paid him a visit
mrs newsome has been with him this month with an intensity that i'm sure he has thoroughly felt he has lavishly entertained her and she has let him have her thanks
do you suggest he shall go back for more of them
well she succeeded after a little in shaking it off
i see
it's what you don't suggestwhat you haven't suggested
and you know
so would you my dear he kindly said if you had so much as seen her
as seen mrs
newsome
no sarahwhich both for chad and for myself has served all the purpose
and served it in a manner she responsively mused so extraordinary
well you see he partly explained what it comes to is that she's all cold thoughtwhich sarah could serve to us cold without its really losing anything
so it is that we know what she thinks of us
maria had followed but she had an arrest
what i've never made out if you come to that is what you thinki mean you personallyof her
don't you so much when all's said as care a little
that he answered with no loss of promptness is what even chad himself asked me last night
he asked me if i don't mind the losswell the loss of an opulent future
which moreover he hastened to add was a perfectly natural question
i call your attention all the same said miss gostrey to the fact that i don't ask it
what i venture to ask is whether it's to mrs newsome herself that you're indifferent
i haven't been sohe spoke with all assurance
i've been the very opposite
i've been from the first moment preoccupied with the impression everything might be making on herquite oppressed haunted tormented by it
i've been interested only in her seeing what i've seen
and i've been as disappointed in her refusal to see it as she has been in what has appeared to her the perversity of my insistence
do you mean that she has shocked you as you've shocked her
strether weighed it
i'm probably not so shockable
but on the other hand i've gone much further to meet her
she on her side hasn't budged an inch
so that you're now at lastmaria pointed the moralin the sad stage of recriminations
noit's only to you i speak
i've been like a lamb to sarah
i've only put my back to the wall
it's to that one naturally staggers when one has been violently pushed there
she watched him a moment
thrown over
well as i feel i've landed somewhere i think i must have been thrown
she turned it over but as hoping to clarify much rather than to harmonise
the thing is that i suppose you've been disappointing  quite from the very first of my arrival
i dare say
i admit i was surprising even to myself
and then of course maria went on i had much to do with it
with my being surprising
that will do she laughed if you're too delicate to call it my being
naturally she added you came over more or less for surprises
naturally
he valued the reminder
but they were to have been all for youshe continued to piece it outand none of them for her
once more he stopped before her as if she had touched the point
that's just her difficultythat she doesn't admit surprises
it's a fact that i think describes and represents her and it falls in with what i tell youthat she's all as i've called it fine cold thought
she had to her own mind worked the whole thing out in advance and worked it out for me as well as for herself
whenever she has done that you see there's no room left no margin as it were for any alteration
she's filled as full packed as tight as she'll hold and if you wish to get anything more or different either out or in  you've got to make over altogether the woman herself
what it comes to said strether is that you've got morally and intellectually to get rid of her
which would appear maria returned to be practically what you've done
but her friend threw back his head
i haven't touched her
she won't be touched
i see it now as i've never done and she hangs together with a perfection of her own he went on that does suggest a kind of wrong in any change of her composition
it was at any rate he wound up the woman herself as you call her the whole moral and intellectual being or block that sarah brought me over to take or to leave
it turned miss gostrey to deeper thought
fancy having to take at the point of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block
it was in fact said strether what at home i had done
but somehow over there i didn't quite know it
one never does i suppose miss gostrey concurred realise in advance in such a case the size as you may say of the block
little by little it looms up
it has been looming for you more and more till at last you see it all
i see it all he absently echoed while his eyes might have been fixing some particularly large iceberg in a cool blue northern sea
it's magnificent
he then rather oddly exclaimed
but his friend who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him kept the thread
there's nothing so magnificentfor making others feel youas to have no imagination
it brought him straight round
ah there you are
it's what i said last night to chad
that he himself i mean has none
then it would appear maria suggested that he has after all something in common with his mother
he has in common that he makes one as you say 'feel' him
and yet he added as if the question were interesting one feels others too even when they have plenty
miss gostrey continued suggestive
madame de vionnet
she has plenty
certainlyshe had quantities of old
but there are different ways of making one's self felt
yes it comes no doubt to that
you now  he was benevolently going on but she wouldn't have it
oh i don't make myself felt so my quantity needn't be settled
yours you know she said is monstrous
no one has ever had so much
it struck him for a moment
that's what chad also thinks
there you are thenthough it isn't for him to complain of it
oh he doesn't complain of it said strether
that's all that would be wanting
but apropos of what maria went on did the question come up
well of his asking me what it is i gain
she had a pause
then as i've asked you too it settles my case
oh you have she repeated treasures of imagination
but he had been for an instant thinking away from this and he came up in another place
and yet mrs newsomeit's a thing to rememberhas imagined did that is imagine and apparently still does horrors about what i should have found
i was booked by her visionextraordinarily intense after allto find them and that i didn't that i couldn't that as she evidently felt i wouldn'tthis evidently didn't at all as they say 'suit' her book
it was more than she could bear
that was her disappointment
you mean you were to have found chad himself horrible
i was to have found the woman
horrible
found her as she imagined her
and strether paused as if for his own expression of it he could add no touch to that picture
his companion had meanwhile thought
she imagined stupidlyso it comes to the same thing
stupidly
oh
said strether
but she insisted
she imagined meanly
he had it however better
it couldn't but be ignorantly
well intensity with ignorancewhat do you want worse
this question might have held him but he let it pass
sarah isn't ignorantnow she keeps up the theory of the horrible
ah but she's intenseand that by itself will do sometimes as well
if it doesn't do in this case at any rate to deny that marie's charming it will do at least to deny that she's good
what i claim is that she's good for chad
you don't claimshe seemed to like it clearthat she's good for you
but he continued without heeding
that's what i wanted them to come out forto see for themselves if she's bad for him
and now that they've done so they won't admit that she's good even for anything
they do think strether presently admitted that she's on the whole about as bad for me
but they're consistent of course inasmuch as they've their clear view of what's good for both of us
for you to begin withmaria all responsive confined the question for the momentto eliminate from your existence and if possible even from your memory the dreadful creature that i must gruesomely shadow forth for them even more than to eliminate the distincter evilthereby a little less portentousof the person whose confederate you've suffered yourself to become
however that's comparatively simple
you can easily at the worst after all give me up
i can easily at the worst after all give you up
the irony was so obvious that it needed no care
i can easily at the worst after all even forget you
call that then workable
but mr newsome has much more to forget
how can he do it
ah there again we are
that's just what i was to have made him do just where i was to have worked with him and helped
she took it in silence and without attenuationas if perhaps from very familiarity with the facts and her thought made a connexion without showing the links
do you remember how we used to talk at chester and in london about my seeing you through
she spoke as of faroff things and as if they had spent weeks at the places she named
it's just what you are doing
ah but the worstsince you've left such a marginmay be still to come
you may yet break down
yes i may yet break down
but will you take me
he had hesitated and she waited
take you
for as long as i can bear it
she also debated mr newsome and madame de vionnet may as we were saying leave town
how long do you think you can bear it without them
strether's reply to this was at first another question
do you mean in order to get away from me
her answer had an abruptness
don't find me rude if i say i should think they'd want to
he looked at her hard againseemed even for an instant to have an intensity of thought under which his colour changed
but he smiled
you mean after what they've done to me
after what she has
at this however with a laugh he was all right again
ah but she hasn't done it yet
iii   he had taken the train a few days after this from a stationas well as to a stationselected almost at random such days whatever should happen were numbered and he had gone forth under the impulseartless enough no doubtto give the whole of one of them to that french ruralism with its cool special green into which he had hitherto looked only through the little oblong window of the pictureframe
it had been as yet for the most part but a land of fancy for himthe background of fiction the medium of art the nursery of letters practically as distant as greece but practically also wellnigh as consecrated
romance could weave itself for strether's sense out of elements mild enough and even after what he had as he felt lately been through he could thrill a little at the chance of seeing something somewhere that would remind him of a certain small lambinet that had charmed him long years before at a boston dealer's and that he had quite absurdly never forgotten
it had been offered he remembered at a price he had been instructed to believe the lowest ever named for a lambinet a price he had never felt so poor as on having to recognise all the same as beyond a dream of possibility
he had dreamedhad turned and twisted possibilities for an hour  it had been the only adventure of his life in connexion with the purchase of a work of art
the adventure it will be perceived was modest but the memory beyond all reason and by some accident of association was sweet
the little lambinet abode with him as the picture he would have boughtthe particular production that had made him for the moment overstep the modesty of nature
he was quite aware that if he were to see it again he should perhaps have a drop or a shock and he never found himself wishing that the wheel of time would turn it up again just as he had seen it in the marooncoloured skylighted inner shrine of tremont street
it would be a different thing however to see the remembered mixture resolved back into its elementsto assist at the restoration to nature of the whole faraway hour  the dusty day in boston the background of the fitchburg depot of the marooncoloured sanctum the specialgreen vision the ridiculous price the poplars the willows the rushes the river the sunny silvery sky the shady woody horizon
he observed in respect to his train almost no condition save that it should stop a few times after getting out of the banlieue he threw himself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of where to alight
his theory of his excursion was that he could alight anywherenot nearer paris than an hour's runon catching a suggestion of the particular note required
it made its sign the suggestionweather air light colour and his mood all favouringat the end of some eighty minutes the train pulled up just at the right spot and he found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an appointment
it will be felt of him that he could amuse himself at his age with very small things if it be again noted that his appointment was only with a superseded boston fashion
he hadn't gone far without the quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently kept
the oblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines the poplars and willows the reeds and rivera river of which he didn't know and didn't want to know the namefell into a composition full of felicity within them the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish the village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey it was all there in shortit was what he wanted  it was tremont street it was france it was lambinet
moreover he was freely walking about in it
he did this last for an hour to his heart's content making for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his impression and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them again and reached the marooncoloured wall
it was a wonder no doubt that the taste of idleness for him shouldn't need more time to sweeten but it had in fact taken the few previous days it had been sweetening in truth ever since the retreat of the pococks
he walked and walked as if to show himself how little he had now to do he had nothing to do but turn off to some hillside where he might stretch himself and hear the poplars rustle and whencein the course of an afternoon so spent an afternoon richly suffused too with the sense of a book in his pockethe should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out just the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to dinner
there was a train back to paris at  and he saw himself partaking at the close of the day with the enhancements of a coarse white cloth and a sanded door of something fried and felicitous washed down with authentic wine after which he might as he liked either stroll back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the local carriole and converse with his driver a driver who naturally wouldn't fail of a stiff clean blouse of a knitted nightcap and of the genius of responsewho in fine would sit on the shafts tell him what the french people were thinking and remind him as indeed the whole episode would incidentally do of maupassant
strether heard his lips for the first time in french air as this vision assumed consistency emit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company
he had been afraid of chad and of maria and of madame de vionnet he had been most of all afraid of waymarsh in whose presence so far as they had mixed together in the light of the town he had never without somehow paying for it aired either his vocabulary or his accent
he usually paid for it by meeting immediately afterwards waymarsh's eye
such were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had turned off to the hillside that did really and truly as well as most amiably await him beneath the poplars the hillside that made him feel for a murmurous couple of hours how happy had been his thought
he had the sense of success of a finer harmony in things nothing but what had turned out as yet according to his plan
it most of all came home to him as he lay on his back on the grass that sarah had really gone that his tension was really relaxed the peace diffused in these ideas might be delusive but it hung about him none the less for the time
it fairly for half an hour sent him to sleep he pulled his straw hat over his eyeshe had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of waymarsh'sand lost himself anew in lambinet
it was as if he had found out he was tiredtired not from his walk but from that inward exercise which had known on the whole for three months so little intermission
that was itwhen once they were off he had dropped this moreover was what he had dropped to and now he was touching bottom
he was kept luxuriously quiet soothed and amused by the consciousness of what he had found at the end of his descent
it was very much what he had told maria gostrey he should like to stay on for the hugelydistributed paris of summer alternately dazzling and dusky with a weight lifted for him off its columns and cornices and with shade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues
it was present to him without attenuation that reaching out the day after making the remark for some proof of his freedom he had gone that very afternoon to see madame de vionnet
he had gone again the next day but one and the effect of the two visits the aftersense of the couple of hours spent with her was almost that of fulness and frequency
the brave intention of frequency so great with him from the moment of his finding himself unjustly suspected at woollett had remained rather theoretic and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars was the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful
he had surely got rid of it now this special shyness what had become of it if it hadn't precisely within the week rubbed off
it struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had still been careful he had been so for a reason
he had really feared in his behaviour a lapse from good faith if there was a danger of one's liking such a woman too much one's best safety was in waiting at least till one had the right to do so
in the light of the last few days the danger was fairly vivid so that it was proportionately fortunate that the right was likewise established
it seemed to our friend that he had on each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter  how could he have done so more he at all events asked himself than in having immediately let her know that if it was all the same to her he preferred not to talk about anything tiresome
he had never in his life so sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark he had never so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in addressing it to madame de vionnet's intelligence
it hadn't been till later that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the pleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked about it was not till later even that he remembered how with their new tone they hadn't so much as mentioned the name of chad himself
one of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this delightful facility with such a woman of arriving at a new tone he thought as he lay on his back of all the tones she might make possible if one were to try her and at any rate of the probability that one could trust her to fit them to occasions
he had wanted her to feel that as he was disinterested now so she herself should be and she had showed she felt it and he had showed he was grateful and it had been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time
they had had other but irrelevant meetings it was quite as if had they sooner known how much they really had in common there were quantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped
well they were skipping them now even to graceful gratitude even to handsome don't mention it
and it was amazing what could still come up without reference to what had been going on between them
it might have been on analysis nothing more than shakespeare and the musical glasses but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have said to her don't like me if it's a question of liking me for anything obvious and clumsy that i've as they call it 'done' for you like mewell like me hang it for anything else you choose
so by the same propriety don't be for me simply the person i've come to know through my awkward connexion with chadwas ever anything by the way more awkward
be for me please with all your admirable tact and trust just whatever i may show you it's a present pleasure to me to think you
it had been a large indication to meet but if she hadn't met it what had she done and how had their time together slipped along so smoothly mild but not slow and melting liquefying into his happy illusion of idleness
he could recognise on the other hand that he had probably not been without reason in his prior his restricted state for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith
he really continued in the picturethat being for himself his situationall the rest of this rambling day so that the charm was still was indeed more than ever upon him when toward six o'clock he found himself amicably engaged with a stout whitecapped deepvoiced woman at the door of the auberge of the biggest village a village that affected him as a thing of whiteness blueness and crookedness set in coppery green and that had the river flowing behind or before itone couldn't say which at the bottom in particular of the inngarden
he had had other adventures before this had kept along the height after shaking off slumber had admired had almost coveted another small old church all steep roof and dim slatecolour without and all whitewash and paper flowers within had lost his way and had found it again had conversed with rustics who struck him perhaps a little more as men of the world than he had expected had acquired at a bound a fearless facility in french had had as the afternoon waned a watery bock all pale and parisian in the cafe of the furthest village which was not the biggest and had meanwhile not once overstepped the oblong gilt frame
the frame had drawn itself out for him as much as you please but that was just his luck
he had finally come down again to the valley to keep within touch of stations and trains turning his face to the quarter from which he had started and thus it was that he had at last pulled up before the hostess of the cheval blanc who met him with a rough readiness that was like the clatter of sabots over stones on their common ground of a cotelette de veau a l'oseille and a subsequent lift
he had walked many miles and didn't know he was tired but he still knew he was amused and even that though he had been alone all day he had never yet so struck himself as engaged with others and in midstream of his drama
it might have passed for finished his drama with its catastrophe all but reached  it had however none the less been vivid again for him as he thus gave it its fuller chance
he had only had to be at last well out of it to feel it oddly enough still going on
for this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picturethat it was essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage that the very air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of the sky
the play and the characters had without his knowing it till now peopled all his space for him and it seemed somehow quite happy that they should offer themselves in the conditions so supplied with a kind of inevitability
it was as if the conditions made them not only inevitable but so much more nearly natural and right as that they were at least easier pleasanter to put up with
the conditions had nowhere so asserted their difference from those of woollett as they appeared to him to assert it in the little court of the cheval blanc while he arranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax
they were few and simple scant and humble but they were the thing as he would have called it even to a greater degree than madame de vionnet's old high salon where the ghost of the empire walked
the thing was the thing that implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he had had to tackle and it was queer of course but so it wasthe implication here was complete
not a single one of his observations but somehow fell into a place in it not a breath of the cooler evening that wasn't somehow a syllable of the text
the text was simply when condensed that in these places such things were and that if it was in them one elected to move about one had to make one's account with what one lighted on
meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did affect oneso far as the village aspect was concernedas whiteness crookedness and blueness set in coppery green there being positively for that matter an outer wall of the white horse that was painted the most improbable shade
that was part of the amusementas if to show that the fun was harmless just as it was enough further that the picture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good woman's broad sketch of what she could do for her visitor's appetite
he felt in short a confidence and it was general and it was all he wanted to feel
it suffered no shock even on her mentioning that she had in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who unlike monsieur had arrived by the riverin a boat of their own who had asked her half an hour before what she could do for them and had then paddled away to look at something a little further upfrom which promenade they would presently return
monsieur might meanwhile if he liked pass into the garden such as it was where she would serve him should he wish itfor there were tables and benches in plentya bitter before his repast
here she would also report to him on the possibility of a conveyance to his station and here at any rate he would have the agrement of the river
it may be mentioned without delay that monsieur had the agrement of everything and in particular for the next twenty minutes of a small and primitive pavilion that at the garden's edge almost overhung the water testifying in its somewhat battered state to much fond frequentation
it consisted of little more than a platform slightly raised with a couple of benches and a table a protecting rail and a projecting roof but it raked the full greyblue stream which taking a turn a short distance above passed out of sight to reappear much higher up and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for sundays and other feasts
strether sat there and though hungry felt at peace the confidence that had so gathered for him deepened with the lap of the water the ripple of the surface the rustle of the reeds on the opposite bank the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a couple of small boats attached to a rough landingplace hard by
the valley on the further side was all coppergreen level and glazed pearly sky a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees which looked flat like espaliers and though the rest of the village straggled away in the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the boats suggestive
such a river set one afloat almost before one could take up the oarsthe idle play of which would be moreover the aid to the full impression
this perception went so far as to bring him to his feet but that movement in turn made him feel afresh that he was tired and while he leaned against a post and continued to look out he saw something that gave him a sharper arrest
iv  what he saw was exactly the right thinga boat advancing round the bend and containing a man who held the paddles and a lady at the stern with a pink parasol
it was suddenly as if these figures or something like them had been wanted in the picture had been wanted more or less all day and had now drifted into sight with the slow current on purpose to fill up the measure
they came slowly floating down evidently directed to the landingplace near their spectator and presenting themselves to him not less clearly as the two persons for whom his hostess was already preparing a meal
for two very happy persons he found himself straightway taking thema young man in shirtsleeves a young woman easy and fair who had pulled pleasantly up from some other place and being acquainted with the neighbourhood had known what this particular retreat could offer them
the air quite thickened at their approach with further intimations the intimation that they were expert familiar frequentthat this wouldn't at all events be the first time
they knew how to do it he vaguely feltand it made them but the more idyllic though at the very moment of the impression as happened their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide the oarsman letting it go
it had by this time none the less come much nearernear enough for strether to dream the lady in the stern had for some reason taken account of his being there to watch them
she had remarked on it sharply yet her companion hadn't turned round it was in fact almost as if our friend had felt her bid him keep still
she had taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered and it continued to waver while they just stood off
this little effect was sudden and rapid so rapid that strether's sense of it was separate only for an instant from a sharp start of his own
he too had within the minute taken in something taken in that he knew the lady whose parasol shifting as if to hide her face made so fine a pink point in the shining scene
it was too prodigious a chance in a million but if he knew the lady the gentleman who still presented his back and kept off the gentleman the coatless hero of the idyll who had responded to her start was to match the marvel none other than chad
chad and madame de vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the countrythough it was as queer as fiction as farce that their country could happen to be exactly his and she had been the first at recognition the first to feel across the water the shockfor it appeared to come to thatof their wonderful accident
strether became aware with this of what was taking placethat her recognition had been even stranger for the pair in the boat that her immediate impulse had been to control it and that she was quickly and intensely debating with chad the risk of betrayal
he saw they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadn't made them out so that he had before him for a few seconds his own hesitation
it was a sharp fantastic crisis that had popped up as if in a dream and it had had only to last the few seconds to make him feel it as quite horrible
they were thus on either side trying the other side and all for some reason that broke the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note
it seemed to him again within the limit that he had but one thing to doto settle their common question by some sign of surprise and joy
he hereupon gave large play to these things agitating his hat and his stick and loudly calling outa demonstration that brought him relief as soon as he had seen it answered
the boat in midstream still went a little wildwhich seemed natural however while chad turned round half springing up and his good friend after blankness and wonder began gaily to wave her parasol
chad dropped afresh to his paddles and the boat headed round amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile and relief as strether continued to fancy superseding mere violence
our friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of violence avertedthe violence of their having cut him out there in the eye of nature on the assumption that he wouldn't know it
he awaited them with a face from which he was conscious of not being able quite to banish this idea that they would have gone on not seeing and not knowing missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess had he himself taken a line to match
that at least was what darkened his vision for the moment
afterwards after they had bumped at the landingplace and he had assisted their getting ashore everything found itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter
they could so much better at last on either side treat it as a wild extravagance of hazard that the situation was made elastic by the amount of explanation called into play
why indeedapart from odditythe situation should have been really stiff was a question naturally not practical at the moment and in fact so far as we are concerned a question tackled later on and in private only by strether himself
he was to reflect later on and in private that it was mainly he who had explainedas he had had moreover comparatively little difficulty in doing
he was to have at all events meanwhile the worrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having plotted this coincidence taking such pains as might be to give it the semblance of an accident
that possibilityas their imputationdidn't of course bear looking into for an instant yet the whole incident was so manifestly arrange it as they would an awkward one that he could scarce keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from rising to his lips
disclaimers of intention would have been as tactless as his presence was practically gross and the narrowest escape they either of them had was his lucky escape in the event from making any
nothing of the sort so far as surface and sound were involved was even in question surface and sound all made for their common ridiculous good fortune for the general invraisemblance of the occasion for the charming chance that they had the others in passing ordered some food to be ready the charming chance that he had himself not eaten the charming chance even more that their little plans their hours their train in short from labas would all match for their return together to paris
the chance that was most charming of all the chance that drew from madame de vionnet her clearest gayest comme cela se trouve
was the announcement made to strether after they were seated at table the word given him by their hostess in respect to his carriage for the station on which he might now count
it settled the matter for his friends as well the conveyanceit was all too luckywould serve for them and nothing was more delightful than his being in a position to make the train so definite
it might have been for themselvesto hear madame de vionnetalmost unnaturally vague a detail left to be fixed though strether indeed was afterwards to remember that chad had promptly enough intervened to forestall this appearance laughing at his companion's flightiness and making the point that he had after all in spite of the bedazzlement of a day out with her known what he was about
strether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him the effect of forming chad's almost sole intervention and indeed he was to remember further still in subsequent meditation many things that as it were fitted together
another of them was for instance that the wonderful woman's overflow of surprise and amusement was wholly into french which she struck him as speaking with an unprecedented command of idiomatic turns but in which she got as he might have said somewhat away from him taking all at once little brilliant jumps that he could but lamely match
the question of his own french had never come up for them it was the one thing she wouldn't have permittedit belonged for a person who had been through much to mere boredom but the present result was odd fairly veiling her identity shifting her back into a mere voluble class or race to the intense audibility of which he was by this time inured
when she spoke the charming slightly strange english he best knew her by he seemed to feel her as a creature among all the millions with a language quite to herself the real monopoly of a special shade of speech beautifully easy for her yet of a colour and a cadence that were both inimitable and matters of accident
she came back to these things after they had shaken down in the innparlour and knew as it were what was to become of them it was inevitable that loud ejaculation over the prodigy of their convergence should at last wear itself out
then it was that his impression took fuller formthe impression destined only to deepen to complete itself that they had something to put a face upon to carry off and make the best of and that it was she who admirably on the whole was doing this
it was familiar to him of course that they had something to put a face upon their friendship their connexion took any amount of explainingthat would have been made familiar by his twenty minutes with mrs pocock if it hadn't already been so
yet his theory as we know had bountifully been that the facts were specifically none of his business and were over and above so far as one had to do with them intrinsically beautiful and this might have prepared him for anything as well as rendered him proof against mystification
when he reached home that night however he knew he had been at bottom neither prepared nor proof and since we have spoken of what he was after his return to recall and interpret it may as well immediately be said that his real experience of these few hours put on in that belated visionfor he scarce went to bed till morningthe aspect that is most to our purpose
he then knew more or less how he had been affectedhe but half knew at the time
there had been plenty to affect him even after as has been said they had shaken down for his consciousness though muffled had its sharpest moments during this passage a marked drop into innocent friendly bohemia
they then had put their elbows on the table deploring the premature end of their two or three dishes which they had tried to make up with another bottle while chad joked a little spasmodically perhaps even a little irrelevantly with the hostess
what it all came to had been that fiction and fable were inevitably in the air and not as a simple term of comparison but as a result of things said also that they were blinking it all round and that they yet needn't so much as that have blinked itthough indeed if they hadn't strether didn't quite see what else they could have done
strether didn't quite see that even at an hour or two past midnight even when he had at his hotel for a long time without a light and without undressing sat back on his bedroom sofa and stared straight before him
he was at that point of vantage in full possession to make of it all what he could
he kept making of it that there had been simply a lie in the charming affaira lie on which one could now detached and deliberate perfectly put one's finger
it was with the lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed that they had waited for their carriole rather impatiently and had then got into the vehicle and sensibly subsiding driven their three or four miles through the darkening summer night
the eating and drinking which had been a resource had had the effect of having served its turn the talk and laughter had done as much and it was during their somewhat tedious progress to the station during the waits there the further delays their submission to fatigue their silences in the dim compartment of the muchstopping train that he prepared himself for reflexions to come
it had been a performance madame de vionnet's manner and though it had to that degree faltered toward the end as through her ceasing to believe in it as if she had asked herself or chad had found a moment surreptitiously to ask her what after all was the use a performance it had none the less quite handsomely remained with the final fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to abandon
from the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful indeed wonderful for readiness for beautiful assurance for the way her decision was taken on the spot without time to confer with chad without time for anything
their only conference could have been the brief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the spectator on the bank for they hadn't been alone together a moment since and must have communicated all in silence
it was a part of the deep impression for strether and not the least of the deep interest that they could so communicatethat chad in particular could let her know he left it to her
he habitually left things to others as strether was so well aware and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live
it was as if he had humoured her to the extent of letting her lie without correctionalmost as if really he would be coming round in the morning to set the matter as between strether and himself right
of course he couldn't quite come it was a case in which a man was obliged to accept the woman's version even when fantastic if she had with more flurry than she cared to show elected as the phrase was to represent that they had left paris that morning and with no design but of getting back within the dayif she had so sizedup in the woollett phrase their necessity she knew best her own measure
there were things all the same it was impossible to blink and which made this measure an odd onethe too evident fact for instance that she hadn't started out for the day dressed and hatted and shod and even for that matter pink parasol'd as she had been in the boat
from what did the drop in her assurance proceed as the tension increasedfrom what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but from her consciousness of not presenting as night closed in with not so much as a shawl to wrap her round an appearance that matched her story
she admitted that she was cold but only to blame her imprudence which chad suffered her to give such account of as she might
her shawl and chad's overcoat and her other garments and his those they had each worn the day before were at the place best known to themselvesa quiet retreat enough no doubtat which they had been spending the twentyfour hours to which they had fully meant to return that evening from which they had so remarkably swum into strether's ken and the tacit repudiation of which had been thus the essence of her comedy
strether saw how she had perceived in a flash that they couldn't quite look to going back there under his nose though honestly as he gouged deeper into the matter he was somewhat surprised as chad likewise had perhaps been at the uprising of this scruple
he seemed even to divine that she had entertained it rather for chad than for herself and that as the young man had lacked the chance to enlighten her she had had to go on with it he meanwhile mistaking her motive
he was rather glad none the less that they had in point of fact not parted at the cheval blanc that he hadn't been reduced to giving them his blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river
he had had in the actual case to makebelieve more than he liked but this was nothing it struck him to what the other event would have required
could he literally quite have faced the other event
would he have been capable of making the best of it with them
this was what he was trying to do now but with the advantage of his being able to give more time to it a good deal counteracted by his sense of what over and above the central fact itself he had to swallow
it was the quantity of makebelieve involved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his spiritual stomach
he moved however from the consideration of that quantityto say nothing of the consciousness of that organback to the other feature of the show the deep deep truth of the intimacy revealed
that was what in his vain vigil he oftenest reverted to  intimacy at such a point was like thatand what in the world else would one have wished it to be like
it was all very well for him to feel the pity of its being so much like lying he almost blushed in the dark for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness as a little girl might have dressed her doll
he had made themand by no fault of their ownmomentarily pull it for him the possibility out of this vagueness and must he not therefore take it now as they had had simply with whatever thin attenuations to give it to him
the very question it may be added made him feel lonely and cold
there was the element of the awkward all round but chad and madame de vionnet had at least the comfort that they could talk it over together
with whom could he talk of such thingsunless indeed always at almost any stage with maria
he foresaw that miss gostrey would come again into requisition on the morrow though it wasn't to be denied that he was already a little afraid of her what on earththat's what i want to know nowhad you then supposed
he recognised at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing
verily verily his labour had been lost
he found himself supposing innumerable and wonderful things
book twelfth     i   strether couldn't have said he had during the previous hours definitely expected it yet when later on that morningthough no later indeed than for his coming forth at ten o'clockhe saw the concierge produce on his approach a petit bleu delivered since his letters had been sent up he recognised the appearance as the first symptom of a sequel
he then knew he had been thinking of some early sign from chad as more likely after all than not and this would be precisely the early sign
he took it so for granted that he opened the petit bleu just where he had stopped in the pleasant cool draught of the portecochereonly curious to see where the young man would at such a juncture break out
his curiosity however was more than gratified the small missive whose gummed edge he had detached without attention to the address not being from the young man at all but from the person whom the case gave him on the spot as still more worth while
worth while or not he went round to the nearest telegraphoffice the big one on the boulevard with a directness that almost confessed to a fear of the danger of delay
he might have been thinking that if he didn't go before he could think he wouldn't perhaps go at all
he at any rate kept in the lower sidepocket of his morning coat a very deliberate hand on his blue missive crumpling it up rather tenderly than harshly
he wrote a reply on the boulevard also in the form of a petit bleuwhich was quickly done under pressure of the place inasmuch as like madame de vionnet's own communication it consisted of the fewest words
she had asked him if he could do her the very great kindness of coming to see her that evening at halfpast nine and he answered as if nothing were easier that he would present himself at the hour she named
she had added a line of postscript to the effect that she would come to him elsewhere and at his own hour if he preferred but he took no notice of this feeling that if he saw her at all half the value of it would be in seeing her where he had already seen her best
he mightn't see her at all that was one of the reflexions he made after writing and before he dropped his closed card into the box he mightn't see any one at all any more at all he might make an end as well now as ever leaving things as they were since he was doubtless not to leave them better and taking his way home so far as should appear that a home remained to him
this alternative was for a few minutes so sharp that if he at last did deposit his missive it was perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect
there was none other however than the common and constant pressure familiar to our friend under the rubric of postes et telegraphesthe something in the air of these establishments the vibration of the vast strange life of the town the influence of the types the performers concocting their messages the little prompt paris women arranging pretexting goodness knew what driving the dreadful needlepointed public pen at the dreadful sandstrewn public table implements that symbolised for strether's too interpretative innocence something more acute in manners more sinister in morals more fierce in the national life
after he had put in his paper he had ranged himself he was really amused to think on the side of the fierce the sinister the acute
he was carrying on a correspondence across the great city quite in the key of the postes et telegraphes in general and it was fairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his state that sorted with the occupation of his neighbours
he was mixed up with the typical tale of paris and so were they poor thingshow could they all together help being
they were no worse than he in short and he no worse than theyif queerly enough no better and at all events he had settled his hash so that he went out to begin from that moment his day of waiting
the great settlement was as he felt in his preference for seeing his correspondent in her own best conditions
that was part of the typical tale the part most significant in respect to himself
he liked the place she lived in the picture that each time squared itself large and high and clear around her  every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different shade
yet what precisely was he doing with shades of pleasure now and why hadn't he properly and logically compelled her to commit herself to whatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might throw up
he might have proposed as for sarah pocock the cold hospitality of his own salon de lecture in which the chill of sarah's visit seemed still to abide and shades of pleasure were dim he might have suggested a stone bench in the dusty tuileries or a penny chair at the back part of the champs elysees
these things would have been a trifle stern and sternness alone now wouldn't be sinister
an instinct in him cast about for some form of discipline in which they might meetsome awkwardness they would suffer from some danger or at least some grave inconvenience they would incur
this would give a sensewhich the spirit required rather ached and sighed in the absence ofthat somebody was paying something somewhere and somehow that they were at least not all floating together on the silver stream of impunity
just instead of that to go and see her late in the evening as if for all the worldwell as if he were as much in the swim as anybody else  this had as little as possible in common with the penal form
even when he had felt that objection melt away however the practical difference was small the long stretch of his interval took the colour it would and if he lived on thus with the sinister from hour to hour it proved an easier thing than one might have supposed in advance
he reverted in thought to his old tradition the one he had been brought up on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away the notion that the state of the wrongdoer or at least this person's happiness presented some special difficulty
what struck him now rather was the ease of itfor nothing in truth appeared easier
it was an ease he himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day giving himself quite up not so much as trying to dress it out in any particular whatever as a difficulty not after all going to see mariawhich would have been in a manner a result of such dressing only idling lounging smoking sitting in the shade drinking lemonade and consuming ices
the day had turned to heat and eventual thunder and he now and again went back to his hotel to find that chad hadn't been there
he hadn't yet struck himself since leaving woollett so much as a loafer though there had been times when he believed himself touching bottom
this was a deeper depth than any and with no foresight scarcely with a care as to what he should bring up
he almost wondered if he didn't look demoralised and disreputable he had the fanciful vision as he sat and smoked of some accidental some motived return of the pococks who would be passing along the boulevard and would catch this view of him
they would have distinctly on his appearance every ground for scandal
but fate failed to administer even that sternness the pococks never passed and chad made no sign
strether meanwhile continued to hold off from miss gostrey keeping her till tomorrow so that by evening his irresponsibility his impunity his luxury had becomethere was no other word for themimmense
between nine and ten at last in the high clear picturehe was moving in these days as in a gallery from clever canvas to clever canvashe drew a long breath  it was so presented to him from the first that the spell of his luxury wouldn't be broken
he wouldn't have that is to become responsiblethis was admirably in the air she had sent for him precisely to let him feel it so that he might go on with the comfort comfort already established hadn't it been
of regarding his ordeal the ordeal of the weeks of sarah's stay and of their climax as safely traversed and left behind him
didn't she just wish to assure him that she now took it all and so kept it that he was absolutely not to worry any more was only to rest on his laurels and continue generously to help her
the light in her beautiful formal room was dim though it would do as everything would always do the hot night had kept out lamps but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over the chimneypiece like the tall tapers of an altar
the windows were all open their redundant hangings swaying a little and he heard once more from the empty court the small plash of the fountain
from beyond this and as from a great distancebeyond the court beyond the corps de logis forming the frontcame as if excited and exciting the vague voice of paris
strether had all along been subject to sudden gusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as theseodd starts of the historic sense suppositions and divinations with no warrant but their intensity
thus and so on the eve of the great recorded dates the days and nights of revolution the sounds had come in the omens the beginnings broken out
they were the smell of revolution the smell of the public temperor perhaps simply the smell of blood
it was at present queer beyond words subtle he would have risked saying that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene but it was doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air which had hung about all day without release
his hostess was dressed as for thunderous times and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have just attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white of a character so oldfashioned if he were not mistaken that madame roland must on the scaffold have worn something like it
this effect was enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf of crape or gauze disposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic touch the pathetic the noble analogy
poor strether in fact scarce knew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman receiving him and making him as she could do such things at once familiarly and gravely welcome moved over her great room with her image almost repeated in its polished floor which had been fully bared for summer
the associations of the place all felt again the gleam here and there in the subdued light of glass and gilt and parquet with the quietness of her own note as the centrethese things were at first as delicate as if they had been ghostly and he was sure in a moment that whatever he should find he had come for it wouldn't be for an impression that had previously failed him
that conviction held him from the outset and seeming singularly to simplify certified to him that the objects about would help him would really help them both
no he might never see them againthis was only too probably the last time and he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them
he should soon be going to where such things were not and it would be a small mercy for memory for fancy to have in that stress a loaf on the shelf
he knew in advance he should look back on the perception actually sharpest with him as on the view of something old old old the oldest thing he had ever personally touched and he also knew even while he took his companion in as the feature among features that memory and fancy couldn't help being enlisted for her
she might intend what she would but this was beyond anything she could intend with things from far backtyrannies of history facts of type values as the painters said of expressionall working for her and giving her the supreme chance the chance of the happy the really luxurious few the chance on a great occasion to be natural and simple
she had never with him been more so or if it was the perfection of art it would neverand that came to the same thingbe proved against her
what was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time without detriment to her simplicity
caprices he was sure she felt were before anything else bad manners and that judgement in her was by itself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that in his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on
if therefore her presence was now quite other than the one she had shown him the night before there was nothing of violence in the changeit was all harmony and reason
it gave him a mild deep person whereas he had had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference a person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them but she was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her bridging of intervals and this now fell in with what he understood he was to leave to her
the only thing was that if he was to leave it all to her why exactly had she sent for him
he had had vaguely in advance his explanation his view of the probability of her wishing to set something right to deal in some way with the fraud so lately practised on his presumed credulity
would she attempt to carry it further or would she blot it out
would she throw over it some more or less happy colour or would she do nothing about it at all
he perceived soon enough at least that however reasonable she might be she wasn't vulgarly confused and it herewith pressed upon him that their eminent lie chad's and hers was simply after all such an inevitable tribute to good taste as he couldn't have wished them not to render
away from them during his vigil he had seemed to wince at the amount of comedy involved whereas in his present posture he could only ask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy back
he shouldn't enjoy it at all but once more and yet once more he could trust her
that is he could trust her to make deception right
as she presented things the uglinessgoodness knew whywent out of them none the less too that she could present them with an art of her own by not so much as touching them
she let the matter at all events lie where it waswhere the previous twentyfour hours had placed it appearing merely to circle about it respectfully tenderly almost piously while she took up another question
she knew she hadn't really thrown dust in his eyes this the previous night before they separated had practically passed between them and as she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him might amount to so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he had been tried and tested
she had settled with chad after he left them that she would for her satisfaction assure herself of this quantity and chad had as usual let her have her way
chad was always letting people have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel for him it somehow always did turn his wheel
strether felt oddly enough before these facts freshly and consentingly passive they again so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention were intimate that his intervention had absolutely aided and intensified their intimacy and that in fine he must accept the consequence of that
he had absolutely become himself with his perceptions and his mistakes his concessions and his reserves the droll mixture as it must seem to them of his braveries and his fears the general spectacle of his art and his innocence almost an added link and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon
it was as if he had been hearing their very tone when she brought out a reference that was comparatively straight
the last twice that you've been here you know i never asked you she said with an abrupt transitionthey had been pretending before this to talk simply of the charm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen
the effort was confessedly vain not for such talk had she invited him and her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the needful on his coming to her after sarah's flight
what she hadn't asked him then was to state to her where and how he stood for her she had been resting on chad's report of their midnight hour together in the boulevard malesherbes
the thing therefore she at present desired was ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which disinterested and merciful she hadn't worried him
tonight truly she would worry him and this was her appeal to him to let her risk it
he wasn't to mind if she bored him a little she had behaved after allhadn't sheso awfully awfully well
ii   oh you're all right you're all right he almost impatiently declared his impatience being moreover not for her pressure but for her scruple
more and more distinct to him was the tune to which she would have had the matter out with chad  more and more vivid for him the idea that she had been nervous as to what he might be able to stand
yes it had been a question if he had stood what the scene on the river had given him and though the young man had doubtless opined in favour of his recuperation her own last word must have been that she should feel easier in seeing for herself
that was it unmistakeably she was seeing for herself
what he could stand was thus in these moments in the balance for strether who reflected as he became fully aware of it that he must properly brace himself
he wanted fully to appear to stand all he might and there was a certain command of the situation for him in this very wish not to look too much at sea
she was ready with everything but so sufficiently was he that is he was at one point the more prepared of the two inasmuch as for all her cleverness she couldn't produce on the spotand it was surprisingan account of the motive of her note
he had the advantage that his pronouncing her all right gave him for an enquiry
may i ask delighted as i've been to come if you've wished to say something special
he spoke as if she might have seen he had been waiting for itnot indeed with discomfort but with natural interest
then he saw that she was a little taken aback was even surprised herself at the detail she had neglectedthe only one ever yet having somehow assumed he would know would recognise would leave some things not to be said
she looked at him however an instant as if to convey that if he wanted them all
selfish and vulgarthat's what i must seem to you
you've done everything for me and here i am as if i were asking for more
but it isn't she went on because i'm afraidthough i am of course afraid as a woman in my position always is
i mean it isn't because one lives in terrorit isn't because of that one is selfish for i'm ready to give you my word tonight that i don't care don't care what still may happen and what i may lose
i don't ask you to raise your little finger for me again nor do i wish so much as to mention to you what we've talked of before either my danger or my safety or his mother or his sister or the girl he may marry or the fortune he may make or miss or the right or the wrong of any kind he may do
if after the help one has had from you one can't either take care of one's self or simply hold one's tongue one must renounce all claim to be an object of interest
it's in the name of what i do care about that i've tried still to keep hold of you
how can i be indifferent she asked to how i appear to you
and as he found himself unable immediately to say  why if you're going need you after all
is it impossible you should stay onso that one mayn't lose you
impossible i should live with you here instead of going home
not 'with' us if you object to that but near enough to us somewhere for us to see youwell she beautifully brought out when we feel we must
how shall we not sometimes feel it
i've wanted to see you often when i couldn't she pursued all these last weeks
how shan't i then miss you now with the sense of your being gone forever
then as if the straightness of this appeal taking him unprepared had visibly left him wondering  where is your 'home' moreover nowwhat has become of it
i've made a change in your life i know i have i've upset everything in your mind as well in your sense ofwhat shall i call itall the decencies and possibilities
it gives me a kind of detestation she pulled up short
oh but he wanted to hear
detestation of what
of everythingof life
ah that's too much he laughedor too little
too little preciselyshe was eager
what i hate is myselfwhen i think that one has to take so much to be happy out of the lives of others and that one isn't happy even then
one does it to cheat one's self and to stop one's mouthbut that's only at the best for a little
the wretched self is always there always making one somehow a fresh anxiety
what it comes to is that it's not that it's never a happiness any happiness at all to take
the only safe thing is to give
it's what plays you least false
interesting touching strikingly sincere as she let these things come from her she yet puzzled and troubled himso fine was the quaver of her quietness
he felt what he had felt before with her that there was always more behind what she showed and more and more again behind that
you know so at least she added where you are
you ought to know it indeed then for isn't what you've been giving exactly what has brought us together this way
you've been making as i've so fully let you know i've felt strether said the most precious present i've ever seen made and if you can't sit down peacefully on that performance you are no doubt born to torment yourself
but you ought he wound up to be easy
and not trouble you any more no doubtnot thrust on you even the wonder and the beauty of what i've done only let you regard our business as over and well over and see you depart in a peace that matches my own
no doubt no doubt no doubt she nervously repeatedall the more that i don't really pretend i believe you couldn't for yourself not have done what you have
i don't pretend you feel yourself victimised for this evidently is the way you live and it's whatwe're agreedis the best way
yes as you say she continued after a moment i ought to be easy and rest on my work
well then here am i doing so
i am easy
you'll have it for your last impression
when is it you say you go
she asked with a quick change
he took some time to replyhis last impression was more and more so mixed a one
it produced in him a vague disappointment a drop that was deeper even than the fall of his elation the previous night
the good of what he had done if he had done so much wasn't there to enliven him quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand gay finale
women were thus endlessly absorbent and to deal with them was to walk on water
what was at bottom the matter with her embroider as she might and disclaim as she mightwhat was at bottom the matter with her was simply chad himself
it was of chad she was after all renewedly afraid the strange strength of her passion was the very strength of her fear she clung to him lambert strether as to a source of safety she had tested and generous graceful truthful as she might try to be exquisite as she was she dreaded the term of his being within reach
with this sharpest perception yet it was like a chill in the air to him it was almost appalling that a creature so fine could be by mysterious forces a creature so exploited
for at the end of all things they were mysterious  she had but made chad what he wasso why could she think she had made him infinite
she had made him better she had made him best she had made him anything one would but it came to our friend with supreme queerness that he was none the less only chad
strether had the sense that he a little had made him too his high appreciation had as it were consecrated her work the work however admirable was nevertheless of the strict human order and in short it was marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys of comforts aberrations however one classed them within the common experience should be so transcendently prized
it might have made strether hot or shy as such secrets of others brought home sometimes do make us but he was held there by something so hard that it was fairly grim
this was not the discomposure of last night that had quite passedsuch discomposures were a detail the real coercion was to see a man ineffably adored
there it was againit took women it took women if to deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that the water rose
and it had never surely risen higher than round this woman
he presently found himself taking a long look from her and the next thing he knew he had uttered all his thought
you're afraid for your life
it drew out her long look and he soon enough saw why
a spasm came into her face the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed at first in silence and then as the sound suddenly comes from a child quickened to gasps to sobs
she sat and covered her face with her hands giving up all attempt at a manner
it's how you see me it's how you see meshe caught her breath with itand it's as i am and as i must take myself and of course it's no matter
her emotion was at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss stand with his sense of having upset her though of having done it by the truth
he had to listen to her in a silence that he made no immediate effort to attenuate feeling her doubly woeful amid all her dim diffused elegance consenting to it as he had consented to the rest and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of such a fine free range of bliss and bale
he couldn't say it was not no matter for he was serving her to the end he now knew anywayquite as if what he thought of her had nothing to do with it
it was actually moreover as if he didn't think of her at all as if he could think of nothing but the passion mature abysmal pitiful she represented and the possibilities she betrayed
she was older for him tonight visibly less exempt from the touch of time but she was as much as ever the finest and subtlest creature the happiest apparition it had been given him in all his years to meet and yet he could see her there as vulgarly troubled in very truth as a maidservant crying for her young man
the only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant wouldn't the weakness of which wisdom too the dishonour of which judgement seemed but to sink her lower
her collapse however no doubt was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he intervened
of course i'm afraid for my life
but that's nothing
it isn't that
he was silent a little longer as if thinking what it might be
there's something i have in mind that i can still do
but she threw off at last with a sharp sad headshake drying her eyes what he could still do
i don't care for that
of course as i've said you're acting in your wonderful way for yourself and what's for yourself is no more my businessthough i may reach out unholy hands so clumsily to touch itthan if it were something in timbuctoo
it's only that you don't snub me as you've had fifty chances to doit's only your beautiful patience that makes one forget one's manners
in spite of your patience all the same she went on you'd do anything rather than be with us here even if that were possible
you'd do everything for us but be mixed up with uswhich is a statement you can easily answer to the advantage of your own manners
you can say 'what's the use of talking of things that at the best are impossible'
what is of course the use
it's only my little madness
you'd talk if you were tormented
and i don't mean now about him
oh for him
positively strangely bitterly as it seemed to strether she gave him for the moment away
you don't care what i think of you but i happen to care what you think of me
and what you might she added
what you perhaps even did
he gained time
what i did
did think before
before this
didn't you think
but he had already stopped her
i didn't think anything
i never think a step further than i'm obliged to
that's perfectly false i believe she returnedexcept that you may no doubt often pull up when things become too ugly or even i'll say to save you a protest too beautiful
at any rate even so far as it's true we've thrust on you appearances that you've had to take in and that have therefore made your obligation
ugly or beautifulit doesn't matter what we call themyou were getting on without them and that's where we're detestable
we bore youthat's where we are
and we may wellfor what we've cost you
all you can do now is not to think at all
and i who should have liked to seem to youwell sublime
he could only after a moment reecho miss barrace
you're wonderful
i'm old and abject and hideousshe went on as without hearing him
abject above all
or old above all
it's when one's old that it's worst
i don't care what becomes of itlet what will there it is
it's a doomi know it you can't see it more than i do myself
things have to happen as they will
with which she came back again to what face to face with him had so quite broken down
of course you wouldn't even if possible and no matter what may happen to you be near us
but think of me think of me
she exhaled it into air
he took refuge in repeating something he had already said and that she had made nothing of
there's something i believe i can still do
and he put his hand out for goodbye
she again made nothing of it she went on with her insistence
that won't help you
there's nothing to help you
well it may help you he said
she shook her head
there's not a grain of certainty in my futurefor the only certainty is that i shall be the loser in the end
she hadn't taken his hand but she moved with him to the door
that's cheerful he laughed for your benefactor
what's cheerful for me she replied is that we might you and i have been friends
that's itthat's it
you see how as i say i want everything
i've wanted you too
ah but you've had me
he declared at the door with an emphasis that made an end
iii   his purpose had been to see chad the next day and he had prefigured seeing him by an early call having in general never stood on ceremony in respect to visits at the boulevard malesherbes
it had been more often natural for him to go there than for chad to come to the small hotel the attractions of which were scant yet it nevertheless just now at the eleventh hour did suggest itself to strether to begin by giving the young man a chance
it struck him that in the inevitable course chad would be round as waymarsh used to saywaymarsh who already somehow seemed long ago
he hadn't come the day before because it had been arranged between them that madame de vionnet should see their friend first but now that this passage had taken place he would present himself and their friend wouldn't have long to wait
strether assumed he became aware on this reasoning that the interesting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes and that the more interesting of the twoas she was after allwould have communicated to the other the issue of her appeal
chad would know without delay that his mother's messenger had been with her and though it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what had occurred he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel he could go on
the day however brought early or late no word from him and strether felt as a result of this that a change had practically come over their intercourse
it was perhaps a premature judgement or it only meant perhapshow could he tellthat the wonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion he had accidentally checked
they might have gone back to the country and gone back but with a long breath drawn that indeed would best mark chad's sense that reprobation hadn't rewarded madame de vionnet's request for an interview
at the end of the twentyfour hours at the end of the fortyeight there was still no overture so that strether filled up the time as he had so often filled it before by going to see miss gostrey
he proposed amusements to her he felt expert now in proposing amusements and he had thus for several days an odd sense of leading her about paris of driving her in the bois of showing her the penny steamboatsthose from which the breeze of the seine was to be best enjoyedthat might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of the capital to an intelligent niece from the country
he found means even to take her to shops she didn't know or that she pretended she didn't while she on her side was like the country maiden all passive modest and gratefulgoing in fact so far as to emulate rusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments
strether described these vague proceedings to himself described them even to her as a happy interlude the sign of which was that the companions said for the time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety
he proclaimed satiety at the outset and she quickly took the hint as docile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient niece
he told her as yet nothing of his late adventurefor as an adventure it now ranked with him he pushed the whole business temporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful assent
she left questions unaskedshe who for so long had been all questions she gave herself up to him with an understanding of which mere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression
she knew his sense of his situation had taken still another stepof that he was quite aware but she conveyed that whatever had thus happened for him it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself
thisthough it mightn't to a detached spirit have seemed muchwas the major interest and she met it with a new directness of response measuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance
touched as he had so often been by her before he was for his part too touched afresh all the more that though he could be duly aware of the principle of his own mood he couldn't be equally so of the principle of hers
he knew that is in a mannerknew roughly and resignedlywhat he himself was hatching whereas he had to take the chance of what he called to himself maria's calculations
it was all he needed that she liked him enough for what they were doing and even should they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that the essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the soreness produced by other relations
these others appeared to him now horribly complex they bristled with fine points points all unimaginable beforehand points that pricked and drew blood a fact that gave to an hour with his present friend on a bateaumouche or in the afternoon shade of the champs elysees something of the innocent pleasure of handling rounded ivory
his relation with chad personallyfrom the moment he had got his point of viewhad been of the simplest yet this also struck him as bristling after a third and a fourth blank day had passed
it was as if at last however his care for such indications had dropped there came a fifth blank day and he ceased to enquire or to heed
they now took on to his fancy miss gostrey and he the image of the babes in the wood they could trust the merciful elements to let them continue at peace
he had been great already as he knew at postponements but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to feel its fine attraction
it amused him to say to himself that he might for all the world have been going to diedie resignedly the scene was filled for him with so deep a deathbed hush so melancholy a charm
that meant the postponement of everything elsewhich made so for the quiet lapse of life and the postponement in especial of the reckoning to comeunless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same thing with extinction
it faced him the reckoning over the shoulder of much interposing experiencewhich also faced him and one would float to it doubtless duly through these caverns of kubla khan
it was really behind everything it hadn't merged in what he had done his final appreciation of what he had donehis appreciation on the spotwould provide it with its main sharpness
the spot so focussed was of course woollett and he was to see at the best what woollett would be with everything there changed for him
wouldn't that revelation practically amount to the windup of his career
well the summer's end would show his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain delay and he had with it we should mention other pastimes than maria's companyplenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed him but at one point
he was well in port the outer sea behind him and it was only a matter of getting ashore
there was a question that came and went for him however as he rested against the side of his ship and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged his hours with miss gostrey
it was a question about himself but it could only be settled by seeing chad again it was indeed his principal reason for wanting to see chad
after that it wouldn't signifyit was a ghost that certain words would easily lay to rest
only the young man must be there to take the words
once they were taken he wouldn't have a question left none that is in connexion with this particular affair
it wouldn't then matter even to himself that he might now have been guilty of speaking because of what he had forfeited
that was the refinement of his supreme scruplehe wished so to leave what he had forfeited out of account
he wished not to do anything because he had missed something else because he was sore or sorry or impoverished because he was maltreated or desperate he wished to do everything because he was lucid and quiet just the same for himself on all essential points as he had ever been
thus it was that while he virtually hung about for chad he kept mutely putting it  you've been chucked old boy but what has that to do with it
it would have sickened him to feel vindictive
these tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his idleness and they were presently lost in a new light from maria
she had a fresh fact for him before the week was out and she practically met him with it on his appearing one night
he hadn't on this day seen her but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her to dine with him somewhere out of doors on one of the terraces in one of the gardens of which the paris of summer was profuse
it had then come on to rain so that disconcerted he changed his mind dining alone at home a little stuffily and stupidly and waiting on her afterwards to make up his loss
he was sure within a minute that something had happened it was so in the air of the rich little room that he had scarcely to name his thought
softly lighted the whole colour of the place with its vague values was in cool fusionan effect that made the visitor stand for a little agaze
it was as if in doing so now he had felt a recent presencehis recognition of the passage of which his hostess in turn divined
she had scarcely to say ityes she has been here and this time i received her
it wasn't till a minute later that she added  there being as i understand you no reason now
none for your refusing
noif you've done what you've had to do
i've certainly so far done it strether said as that you needn't fear the effect or the appearance of coming between us
there's nothing between us now but what we ourselves have put there and not an inch of room for anything else whatever
therefore you're only beautifully with us as alwaysthough doubtless now if she has talked to you rather more with us than less
of course if she came he added it was to talk to you
it was to talk to me maria returned on which he was further sure that she was practically in possession of what he himself hadn't yet told her
he was even sure she was in possession of things he himself couldn't have told for the consciousness of them was now all in her face and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her the close of all uncertainties
it came out for him more than ever yet that she had had from the first a knowledge she believed him not to have had a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined to make a difference for him
the difference for him might not inconceivably be an arrest of his independence and a change in his attitudein other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of woollett
she had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that would send him swinging back to mrs newsome
he hadn't it was true week after week shown signs of receiving it but the possibility had been none the less in the air
what maria accordingly had had now to take in was that the shock had descended and that he hadn't all the same swung back
he had grown clear in a flash on a point long since settled for herself but no reapproximation to mrs newsome had occurred in consequence
madame de vionnet had by her visit held up the torch to these truths and what now lingered in poor maria's face was the somewhat smoky light of the scene between them
if the light however wasn't as we have hinted the glow of joy the reasons for this also were perhaps discernible to strether even through the blur cast over them by his natural modesty
she had held herself for months with a firm hand she hadn't interfered on any chanceand chances were specious enoughthat she might interfere to her profit
she had turned her back on the dream that mrs newsome's rupture their friend's forfeiturethe engagement the relation itself broken beyond all mendingmight furnish forth her advantage and to stay her hand from promoting these things she had on private difficult but rigid lines played strictly fair
she couldn't therefore but feel that though as the end of all the facts in question had been stoutly confirmed her ground for personal for what might have been called interested elation remained rather vague
strether might easily have made out that she had been asking herself in the hours she had just sat through if there were still for her or were only not a fair shade of uncertainty
let us hasten to add however that what he at first made out on this occasion he also at first kept to himself
he only asked what in particular madame de vionnet had come for and as to this his companion was ready
she wants tidings of mr newsome whom she appears not to have seen for some days
then she hasn't been away with him again
she seemed to think maria answered that he might have gone away with you
and did you tell her i know nothing of him
she had her indulgent headshake
i've known nothing of what you know
i could only tell her i'd ask you
then i've not seen him for a weekand of course i've wondered
his wonderment showed at this moment as sharper but he presently went on
still i dare say i can put my hand on him
did she strike you he asked as anxious
she's always anxious
after all i've done for her
and he had one of the last flickers of his occasional mild mirth
to think that was just what i came out to prevent
she took it up but to reply
you don't regard him then as safe
i was just going to ask you how in that respect you regard madame de vionnet
she looked at him a little
what woman was ever safe
she told me she addedand it was as if at the touch of the connexionof your extraordinary meeting in the country
after that a quoi se fier
it was as an accident in all the possible or impossible chapter strether conceded amazing enough
but still but still
but still she didn't mind
she doesn't mind anything
well then as you don't either we may all sink to rest
he appeared to agree with her but he had his reservation
i do mind chad's disappearance
oh you'll get him back
but now you know she said why i went to mentone
he had sufficiently let her see that he had by this time gathered things together but there was nature in her wish to make them clearer still
i didn't want you to put it to me
to put it to you
the question of what you were at lasta week agoto see for yourself
i didn't want to have to lie for her
i felt that to be too much for me
a man of course is always expected to do itto do it i mean for a woman but not a woman for another woman unless perhaps on the titfortat principle as an indirect way of protecting herself
i don't need protection so that i was free to 'funk' yousimply to dodge your test
the responsibility was too much for me
i gained time and when i came back the need of a test had blown over
strether thought of it serenely
yes when you came back little bilham had shown me what's expected of a gentleman
little bilham had lied like one
and like what you believed him
well said strether it was but a technical liehe classed the attachment as virtuous
that was a view for which there was much to be saidand the virtue came out for me hugely there was of course a great deal of it
i got it full in the face and i haven't you see done with it yet
what i see what i saw maria returned is that you dressed up even the virtue
you were wonderfulyou were beautiful as i've had the honour of telling you before but if you wish really to know she sadly confessed i never quite knew where you were
there were moments she explained when you struck me as grandly cynical there were others when you struck me as grandly vague
her friend considered
i had phases
i had flights
yes but things must have a basis
a basis seemed to me just what her beauty supplied
her beauty of person
well her beauty of everything
the impression she makes
she has such variety and yet such harmony
she considered him with one of her deep returns of indulgencereturns out of all proportion to the irritations they flooded over
you're complete
you're always too personal he goodhumouredly said but that's precisely how i wondered and wandered
if you mean she went on that she was from the first for you the most charming woman in the world nothing's more simple
only that was an odd foundation
for what i reared on it
for what you didn't
well it was all not a fixed quantity
and it had for meit has stillsuch elements of strangeness
her greater age than his her different world traditions association her other opportunities liabilities standards
his friend listened with respect to his enumeration of these disparities then she disposed of them at a stroke
those things are nothing when a woman's hit
it's very awful
she was hit
strether on his side did justice to that plea
oh of course i saw she was hit
that she was hit was what we were busy with that she was hit was our great affair
but somehow i couldn't think of her as down in the dust
and as put there by our little chad
yet wasn't 'your' little chad just your miracle
strether admitted it
of course i moved among miracles
it was all phantasmagoric
but the great fact was that so much of it was none of my businessas i saw my business
it isn't even now
his companion turned away on this and it might well have been yet again with the sharpness of a fear of how little his philosophy could bring her personally
i wish she could hear you
mrs
newsome
nonot mrs newsome since i understand you that it doesn't matter now what mrs newsome hears
hasn't she heard everything
practicallyyes
he had thought a moment but he went on
you wish madame de vionnet could hear me
madame de vionnet
she had come back to him
she thinks just the contrary of what you say
that you distinctly judge her
he turned over the scene as the two women thus placed together for him seemed to give it
she might have known
might have known you don't
miss gostrey asked as he let it drop
she was sure of it at first she pursued as he said nothing she took it for granted at least as any woman in her position would
but after that she changed her mind she believed you believed  well
he was curious
why in her sublimity
and that belief had remained with her i make out till the accident of the other day opened your eyes
for that it did said maria open them  she can't helphe had taken it upbeing aware
no he mused i suppose she thinks of that even yet
then they were closed
there you are
however if you see her as the most charming woman in the world it comes to the same thing
and if you'd like me to tell her that you do still so see her
miss gostrey in short offered herself for service to the end
it was an offer he could temporarily entertain but he decided
she knows perfectly how i see her
not favourably enough she mentioned to me to wish ever to see her again
she told me you had taken a final leave of her
she says you've done with her
so i have
maria had a pause then she spoke as if for conscience
she wouldn't have done with you
she feels she has lost youyet that she might have been better for you
oh she has been quite good enough
strether laughed
she thinks you and she might at any rate have been friends
we might certainly
that's justhe continued to laughwhy i'm going
it was as if maria could feel with this then at last that she had done her best for each
but she had still an idea
shall i tell her that
no
tell her nothing
very well then
to which in the next breath miss gostrey added poor dear thing
her friend wondered then with raised eyebrows  me
oh no
marie de vionnet
he accepted the correction but he wondered still
are you so sorry for her as that
it made her think a momentmade her even speak with a smile
but she didn't really retract
i'm sorry for us all
iv  he was to delay no longer to reestablish communication with chad and we have just seen that he had spoken to miss gostrey of this intention on hearing from her of the young man's absence
it was not moreover only the assurance so given that prompted him it was the need of causing his conduct to square with another profession stillthe motive he had described to her as his sharpest for now getting away
if he was to get away because of some of the relations involved in staying the cold attitude toward them might look pedantic in the light of lingering on
he must do both things he must see chad but he must go
the more he thought of the former of these duties the more he felt himself make a subject of insistence of the latter
they were alike intensely present to him as he sat in front of a quiet little cafe into which he had dropped on quitting maria's entresol
the rain that had spoiled his evening with her was over for it was still to him as if his evening had been spoiledthough it mightn't have been wholly the rain
it was late when he left the cafe yet not too late he couldn't in any case go straight to bed and he would walk round by the boulevard malesherbesrather far roundon his way home
present enough always was the small circumstance that had originally pressed for him the spring of so big a differencethe accident of little bilham's appearance on the balcony of the mystic troisieme at the moment of his first visit and the effect of it on his sense of what was then before him
he recalled his watch his wait and the recognition that had proceeded from the young stranger that had played frankly into the air and had presently brought him upthings smoothing the way for his first straight step
he had since had occasion a few times to pass the house without going in but he had never passed it without again feeling how it had then spoken to him
he stopped short tonight on coming to sight of it  it was as if his last day were oddly copying his first
the windows of chad's apartment were open to the balconya pair of them lighted and a figure that had come out and taken up little bilham's attitude a figure whose cigarettespark he could see leaned on the rail and looked down at him
it denoted however no reappearance of his younger friend it quickly defined itself in the tempered darkness as chad's more solid shape so that chad's was the attention that after he had stepped forward into the street and signalled he easily engaged chad's was the voice that sounding into the night with promptness and seemingly with joy greeted him and called him up
that the young man had been visible there just in this position expressed somehow for strether that as maria gostrey had reported he had been absent and silent and our friend drew breath on each landingthe lift at that hour having ceased to workbefore the implications of the fact
he had been for a week intensely away away to a distance and alone but he was more back than ever and the attitude in which strether had surprised him was something more than a returnit was clearly a conscious surrender
he had arrived but an hour before from london from lucerne from homburg from no matter wherethough the visitor's fancy on the staircase liked to fill it out and after a bath a talk with baptiste and a supper of light cold clever french things which one could see the remains of there in the circle of the lamp pretty and ultraparisian he had come into the air again for a smoke was occupied at the moment of strether's approach in what might have been called taking up his life afresh
his life his lifestrether paused anew on the last flight at this final rather breathless sense of what chad's life was doing with chad's mother's emissary
it was dragging him at strange hours up the staircases of the rich it was keeping him out of bed at the end of long hot days it was transforming beyond recognition the simple subtle conveniently uniform thing that had anciently passed with him for a life of his own
why should it concern him that chad was to be fortified in the pleasant practice of smoking on balconies of supping on salads of feeling his special conditions agreeably reaffirm themselves of finding reassurance in comparisons and contrasts
there was no answer to such a question but that he was still practically committedhe had perhaps never yet so much known it
it made him feel old and he would buy his railwayticketfeeling no doubt olderthe next day but he had meanwhile come up four flights counting the entresol at midnight and without a lift for chad's life
the young man hearing him by this time and with baptiste sent to rest was already at the door so that strether had before him in full visibility the cause in which he was labouring and even with the troisieme fairly gained panting a little
chad offered him as always a welcome in which the cordial and the formalso far as the formal was the respectfulhandsomely met and after he had expressed a hope that he would let him put him up for the night strether was in full possession of the key as it might have been called to what had lately happened
if he had just thought of himself as old chad was at sight of him thinking of him as older  he wanted to put him up for the night just because he was ancient and weary
it could never be said the tenant of these quarters wasn't nice to him a tenant who if he might indeed now keep him was probably prepared to work it all still more thoroughly
our friend had in fact the impression that with the minimum of encouragement chad would propose to keep him indefinitely an impression in the lap of which one of his own possibilities seemed to sit
madame de vionnet had wished him to stayso why didn't that happily fit
he could enshrine himself for the rest of his days in his young host's chambre d'ami and draw out these days at his young host's expense  there could scarce be greater logical expression of the countenance he had been moved to give
there was literally a minuteit was strange enoughduring which he grasped the idea that as he was acting as he could only act he was inconsistent
the sign that the inward forces he had obeyed really hung together would be thatin default always of another careerhe should promote the good cause by mounting guard on it
these things during his first minutes came and went but they were after all practically disposed of as soon as he had mentioned his errand
he had come to say goodbyeyet that was only a part so that from the moment chad accepted his farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation gave way to something else
he proceeded with the rest of his business
you'll be a brute you knowyou'll be guilty of the last infamyif you ever forsake her
that uttered there at the solemn hour uttered in the place that was full of her influence was the rest of his business and when once he had heard himself say it he felt that his message had never before been spoken
it placed his present call immediately on solid ground and the effect of it was to enable him quite to play with what we have called the key
chad showed no shade of embarrassment but had none the less been troubled for him after their meeting in the country had had fears and doubts on the subject of his comfort
he was disturbed as it were only for him and had positively gone away to ease him off to let him downif it wasn't indeed rather to screw him upthe more gently
seeing him now fairly jaded he had come with characteristic good humour all the way to meet him and what strether thereupon supremely made out was that he would abound for him to the end in conscientious assurances
this was what was between them while the visitor remained so far from having to go over old ground he found his entertainer keen to agree to everything
it couldn't be put too strongly for him that he'd be a brute
oh ratherif i should do anything of that sort
i hope you believe i really feel it
i want it said strether to be my last word of all to you
i can't say more you know and i don't see how i can do more in every way than i've done
chad took this almost artlessly as a direct allusion
you've seen her
oh yesto say goodbye
and if i had doubted the truth of what i tell you  she'd have cleared up your doubt
chad understoodratheragain
it even kept him briefly silent
but he made that up
she must have been wonderful
she was strether candidly admittedall of which practically told as a reference to the conditions created by the accident of the previous week
they appeared for a little to be looking back at it and that came out still more in what chad next said
i don't know what you've really thought all along i never did knowfor anything with you seemed to be possible
but of courseof course  without confusion quite with nothing but indulgence he broke down he pulled up
after all you understand
i spoke to you originally only as i had to speak
there's only one wayisn't thereabout such things
however he smiled with a final philosophy i see it's all right
strether met his eyes with a sense of multiplying thoughts
what was it that made him at present late at night and after journeys so renewedly so substantially young
strether saw in a moment what it wasit was that he was younger again than madame de vionnet
he himself said immediately none of the things that he was thinking he said something quite different
you have really been to a distance
i've been to england
chad spoke cheerfully and promptly but gave no further account of it than to say  one must sometimes get off
strether wanted no more factshe only wanted to justify as it were his question
of course you do as you're free to do
but i hope this time that you didn't go for me
for very shame at bothering you really too much
my dear man chad laughed what wouldn't i do for you
strether's easy answer for this was that it was a disposition he had exactly come to profit by
even at the risk of being in your way i've waited on you know for a definite reason
chad took it in
oh yesfor us to make if possible a still better impression
and he stood there happily exhaling his full general consciousness
i'm delighted to gather that you feel we've made it
there was a pleasant irony in the words which his guest preoccupied and keeping to the point didn't take up
if i had my sense of wanting the rest of the timethe time of their being still on this side he continued to explaini know now why i wanted it
he was as grave as distinct as a demonstrator before a blackboard and chad continued to face him like an intelligent pupil
you wanted to have been put through the whole thing
strether again for a moment said nothing he turned his eyes away and they lost themselves through the open window in the dusky outer air
i shall learn from the bank here where they're now having their letters and my last word which i shall write in the morning and which they're expecting as my ultimatum will so immediately reach them
the light of his plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his companion's face as he again met it and he completed his demonstration
he pursued indeed as if for himself
of course i've first to justify what i shall do
you're justifying it beautifully
chad declared
it's not a question of advising you not to go strether said but of absolutely preventing you if possible from so much as thinking of it
let me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred
chad showed a surprise
what makes you think me capable
you'd not only be as i say a brute you'd be his companion went on in the same way a criminal of the deepest dye
chad gave a sharper look as if to gauge a possible suspicion
i don't know what should make you think i'm tired of her
strether didn't quite know either and such impressions for the imaginative mind were always too fine too floating to produce on the spot their warrant
there was none the less for him in the very manner of his host's allusion to satiety as a thinkable motive a slight breath of the ominous
i feel how much more she can do for you
she hasn't done it all yet
stay with her at least till she has
and leave her then
chad had kept smiling but its effect in strether was a shade of dryness
don't leave her before
when you've got all that can be goti don't say he added a trifle grimly
that will be the proper time
but as for you from such a woman there will always be something to be got my remark's not a wrong to her
chad let him go on showing every decent deference showing perhaps also a candid curiosity for this sharper accent
i remember you you know as you were
an awful ass wasn't i
the response was as prompt as if he had pressed a spring it had a ready abundance at which he even winced so that he took a moment to meet it
you certainly then wouldn't have seemed worth all you've let me in for
you've defined yourself better
your value has quintupled
well then wouldn't that be enough
chad had risked it jocosely but strether remained blank
enough
if one should wish to live on one's accumulations
after which however as his friend appeared cold to the joke the young man as easily dropped it
of course i really never forget night or day what i owe her
i owe her everything
i give you my word of honour he frankly rang out that i'm not a bit tired of her
strether at this only gave him a stare  the way youth could express itself was again and again a wonder
he meant no harm though he might after all be capable of much yet he spoke of being tired of her almost as he might have spoken of being tired of roast mutton for dinner
she has never for a moment yet bored menever been wanting as the cleverest women sometimes are in tact
she has never talked about her tactas even they too sometimes talk but she has always had it
she has never had it morehe handsomely made the pointthan just lately
and he scrupulously went further
she has never been anything i could call a burden
strether for a moment said nothing then he spoke gravely with his shade of dryness deepened
oh if you didn't do her justice
i should be a beast eh
strether devoted no time to saying what he would be that visibly would take them far
if there was nothing for it but to repeat however repetition was no mistake
you owe her everythingvery much more than she can ever owe you
you've in other words duties to her of the most positive sort and i don't see what other dutiesas the others are presented to youcan be held to go before them
chad looked at him with a smile
and you know of course about the others ehsince it's you yourself who have done the presenting
much of ityesand to the best of my ability
but not allfrom the moment your sister took my place
she didn't chad returned
sally took a place certainly but it was never i saw from the first moment to be yours
no onewith uswill ever take yours
it wouldn't be possible
ah of course sighed strether i knew it
i believe you're right
no one in the world i imagine was ever so portentously solemn
there i am he added with another sigh as if weary enough on occasion of this truth
i was made so
chad appeared for a little to consider the way he was made he might for this purpose have measured him up and down
his conclusion favoured the fact
you have never needed any one to make you better
there has never been any one good enough
they couldn't the young man declared
his friend hesitated
i beg your pardon
they have
chad showed not without amusement his doubt
who then
stretherthough a little dimlysmiled at him
womentoo
'two'
chad stared and laughed
oh i don't believe for such work in any more than one
so you're proving too much
and what is beastly at all events he added is losing you
strether had set himself in motion for departure but at this he paused
are you afraid
afraid
of doing wrong
i mean away from my eye
before chad could speak however he had taken himself up
i am certainly he laughed prodigious
yes you spoil us for all the stupid
this might have been on chad's part in its extreme emphasis almost too freely extravagant but it was full plainly enough of the intention of comfort it carried with it a protest against doubt and a promise positively of performance
picking up a hat in the vestibule he came out with his friend came downstairs took his arm affectionately as to help and guide him treating him if not exactly as aged and infirm yet as a noble eccentric who appealed to tenderness and keeping on with him while they walked to the next corner and the next
you needn't tell me you needn't tell me
this again as they proceeded he wished to make strether feel
what he needn't tell him was now at last in the geniality of separation anything at all it concerned him to know
he knew up to the hiltthat really came over chad he understood felt recorded his vow and they lingered on it as they had lingered in their walk to strether's hotel the night of their first meeting
the latter took at this hour all he could get he had given all he had had to give he was as depleted as if he had spent his last sou
but there was just one thing for which before they broke off chad seemed disposed slightly to bargain
his companion needn't as he said tell him but he might himself mention that he had been getting some news of the art of advertisement
he came out quite suddenly with this announcement while strether wondered if his revived interest were what had taken him with strange inconsequence over to london
he appeared at all events to have been looking into the question and had encountered a revelation
advertising scientifically worked presented itself thus as the great new force
it really does the thing you know
they were face to face under the streetlamp as they had been the first night and strether no doubt looked blank
affects you mean the sale of the object advertised
yesbut affects it extraordinarily really beyond what one had supposed
i mean of course when it's done as one makes out that in our roaring age it can be done
i've been finding out a little though it doubtless doesn't amount to much more than what you originally so awfully vividlyand all very nearly that first nightput before me
it's an art like another and infinite like all the arts
he went on as if for the joke of italmost as if his friend's face amused him
in the hands naturally of a master
the right man must take hold
with the right man to work it c'est un monde
strether had watched him quite as if there on the pavement without a pretext he had begun to dance a fancy step
is what you're thinking of that you yourself in the case you have in mind would be the right man
chad had thrown back his light coat and thrust each of his thumbs into an armhole of his waistcoat in which position his fingers played up and down
why what is he but what you yourself as i say took me for when you first came out
strether felt a little faint but he coerced his attention
oh yes and there's no doubt that with your natural parts you'd have much in common with him
advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret of trade
it's quite possible it will be open to yougiving the whole of your mind to itto make the whole place hum with you
your mother's appeal is to the whole of your mind and that's exactly the strength of her case
chad's fingers continued to twiddle but he had something of a drop
ah we've been through my mother's case
so i thought
why then do you speak of the matter
only because it was part of our original discussion
to wind up where we began my interest's purely platonic
there at any rate the fact isthe fact of the possible
i mean the money in it
oh damn the money in it
said strether
and then as the young man's fixed smile seemed to shine out more strange  shall you give your friend up for the money in it
chad preserved his handsome grimace as well as the rest of his attitude
you're not altogetherin your so great 'solemnity'kind
haven't i been drinking you inshowing you all i feel you're worth to me
what have i done what am i doing but cleave to her to the death
the only thing is he goodhumouredly explained that one can't but have it before one in the cleavingthe point where the death comes in
don't be afraid for that
it's pleasant to a fellow's feelings he developed to 'sizeup' the bribe he applies his foot to
oh then if all you want's a kickable surface the bribe's enormous
good
then there it goes
chad administered his kick with fantastic force and sent an imaginary object flying
it was accordingly as if they were once more rid of the question and could come back to what really concerned him
of course i shall see you tomorrow
but strether scarce heeded the plan proposed for this he had still the impressionnot the slighter for the simulated kickof an irrelevant hornpipe or jig
you're restless
ah returned chad as they parted you're exciting
v   he had however within two days another separation to face
he had sent maria gostrey a word early by hand to ask if he might come to breakfast in consequence of which at noon she awaited him in the cool shade of her little dutchlooking diningroom
this retreat was at the back of the house with a view of a scrap of old garden that had been saved from modern ravage and though he had on more than one other occasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of hospitality the place had never before struck him as so sacred to pleasant knowledge to intimate charm to antique order to a neatness that was almost august
to sit there was as he had told his hostess before to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter which was somehow becoming improving to life so that one's eyes were held and comforted
strether's were comforted at all events nowand the more that it was the last timewith the charming effect on the board bare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface of the small old crockery and old silver matched by the more substantial pieces happily disposed about the room
the specimens of vivid delf in particular had the dignity of family portraits and it was in the midst of them that our friend resignedly expressed himself
he spoke even with a certain philosophic humour
there's nothing more to wait for i seem to have done a good day's work
i've let them have it all round
i've seen chad who has been to london and come back
he tells me i'm 'exciting' and i seem indeed pretty well to have upset every one
i've at any rate excited him
he's distinctly restless
you've excited me miss gostrey smiled
i'm distinctly restless
oh you were that when i found you
it seems to me i've rather got you out of it
what's this he asked as he looked about him but a haunt of ancient peace
i wish with all my heart she presently replied i could make you treat it as a haven of rest
on which they fronted each other across the table as if things unuttered were in the air
strether seemed in his way when he next spoke to take some of them up
it wouldn't give methat would be the troublewhat it will no doubt still give you
i'm not he explained leaning back in his chair but with his eyes on a small ripe round melonin real harmony with what surrounds me
you are
i take it too hard
you don't
it makesthat's what it comes to in the enda fool of me
then at a tangent what has he been doing in london
he demanded
ah one may go to london maria laughed
you know i did
yeshe took the reminder
and you brought me back
he brooded there opposite to her but without gloom
whom has chad brought
he's full of ideas
and i wrote to sarah he added the first thing this morning
so i'm square
i'm ready for them
she neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others
marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings of an immense man of business
there it is
he's the son of his father
but such a father
ah just the right one from that point of view
but it isn't his father in him strether added that troubles me
what is it then
he came back to his breakfast he partook presently of the charming melon which she liberally cut for him and it was only after this that he met her question
then moreover it was but to remark that he'd answer her presently
she waited she watched she served him and amused him and it was perhaps with this last idea that she soon reminded him of his having never even yet named to her the article produced at woollett
do you remember our talking of it in londonthat night at the play
before he could say yes however she had put it to him for other matters
did he remember did he rememberthis and that of their first days
he remembered everything bringing up with humour even things of which she professed no recollection things she vehemently denied and falling back above all on the great interest of their early time the curiosity felt by both of them as to where he would come out
they had so assumed it was to be in some wonderful placethey had thought of it as so very much out
well that was doubtless what it had beensince he had come out just there
he was out in truth as far as it was possible to be and must now rather bethink himself of getting in again
he found on the spot the image of his recent history he was like one of the figures of the old clock at berne
they came out on one side at their hour jigged along their little course in the public eye and went in on the other side
he too had jigged his little coursehim too a modest retreat awaited
he offered now should she really like to know to name the great product of woollett
it would be a great commentary on everything
at this she stopped him off she not only had no wish to know but she wouldn't know for the world
she had done with the products of woollettfor all the good she had got from them
she desired no further news of them and she mentioned that madame de vionnet herself had to her knowledge lived exempt from the information he was ready to supply
she had never consented to receive it though she would have taken it under stress from mrs pocock
but it was a matter about which mrs pocock appeared to have had little to saynever sounding the wordand it didn't signify now
there was nothing clearly for maria gostrey that signified nowsave one sharp point that is to which she came in time
i don't know whether it's before you as a possibility that left to himself mr chad may after all go back
i judge that it is more or less so before you from what you just now said of him
her guest had his eyes on her kindly but attentively as if foreseeing what was to follow this
i don't think it will be for the money
and then as she seemed uncertain  i mean i don't believe it will be for that he'll give her up
then he will give her up
strether waited a moment rather slow and deliberate now drawing out a little this last soft stage pleading with her in various suggestive and unspoken ways for patience and understanding
what were you just about to ask me
is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up
with mrs
newsome
her assent as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name was only in her face but she added with it  or is there anything he can do that would make her try it
to patch it up with me
his answer came at last in a conclusive headshake
there's nothing any one can do
it's over
over for both of us
maria wondered seemed a little to doubt
are you so sure for her
oh yessure now
too much has happened
i'm different for her
she took it in then drawing a deeper breath
i see
so that as she's different for you  ah but he interrupted she's not
and as miss gostrey wondered again  she's the same
she's more than ever the same
but i do what i didn't beforei see her
he spoke gravely and as if responsiblysince he had to pronounce and the effect of it was slightly solemn so that she simply exclaimed oh
satisfied and grateful however she showed in her own next words an acceptance of his statement
what then do you go home to
he had pushed his plate a little away occupied with another side of the matter taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that he soon found himself on his feet
he was affected in advance by what he believed might come from her and he would have liked to forestall it and deal with it tenderly  yet in the presence of it he wished still more to bethough as smoothly as possibledeterrent and conclusive
he put her question by for the moment he told her more about chad
it would have been impossible to meet me more than he did last night on the question of the infamy of not sticking to her
is that what you called it for him'infamy'
oh rather
i described to him in detail the base creature he'd be and he quite agrees with me about it
so that it's really as if you had nailed him
quite really as if
i told him i should curse him
oh she smiled you have done it
and then having thought again you can't after that propose
yet she scanned his face
propose again to mrs
newsome
she hesitated afresh but she brought it out
i've never believed you know that you did propose
i always believed it was really sheand so far as that goes i can understand it
what i mean is she explained that with such a spiritthe spirit of cursesyour breach is past mending
she has only to know what you've done to him never again to raise a finger
i've done said strether what i couldone can't do more
he protests his devotion and his horror
but i'm not sure i've saved him
he protests too much
he asks how one can dream of his being tired
but he has all life before him
maria saw what he meant
he's formed to please
and it's our friend who has formed him
strether felt in it the strange irony
so it's scarcely his fault
it's at any rate his danger
i mean said strether it's hers
but she knows it
yes she knows it
and is your idea miss gostrey asked that there was some other woman in london
yes
no
that is i have no ideas
i'm afraid of them
i've done with them
and he put out his hand to her
goodbye
it brought her back to her unanswered question
to what do you go home
i don't know
there will always be something
to a great difference she said as she kept his hand
a great differenceno doubt
yet i shall see what i can make of it
shall you make anything so good
but as if remembering what mrs newsome had done it was as far as she went
he had sufficiently understood
so good as this place at this moment
so good as what you make of everything you touch
he took a moment to say for really and truly what stood about him there in her offerwhich was as the offer of exquisite service of lightened care for the rest of his daysmight well have tempted
it built him softly round it roofed him warmly over it rested all so firm on selection
and what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge
it was awkward it was almost stupid not to seem to prize such things yet none the less so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a moment
she'd moreover understandshe always understood
that indeed might be but meanwhile she was going on
there's nothing you know i wouldn't do for you
oh yesi know
there's nothing she repeated in all the world
i know
i know
but all the same i must go
he had got it at last
to be right
to be right
she had echoed it in vague deprecation but he felt it already clear for her
that you see is my only logic
not out of the whole affair to have got anything for myself
she thought
but with your wonderful impressions you'll have got a great deal
a great dealhe agreed
but nothing like you
it's you who would make me wrong
honest and fine she couldn't greatly pretend she didn't see it
still she could pretend just a little
but why should you be so dreadfully right
that's the way thatif i must goyou yourself would be the first to want me
and i can't do anything else
so then she had to take it though still with her defeated protest
it isn't so much your being 'right'it's your horrible sharp eye for what makes you so
oh but you're just as bad yourself
you can't resist me when i point that out
she sighed it at last all comically all tragically away
i can't indeed resist you
then there we are
said strether
the turn of the screw   the story had held us round the fire sufficiently breathless but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome as on christmas eve in an old house a strange tale should essentially be i remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child
the case i may mention was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasionan appearance of a dreadful kind to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again but to encounter also herself before she had succeeded in doing so the same sight that had shaken him
it was this observation that drew from douglasnot immediately but later in the eveninga reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
someone else told a story not particularly effective which i saw he was not following
this i took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait
we waited in fact till two nights later but that same evening before we scattered he brought out what was in his mind
i quite agreein regard to griffins ghost or whatever it wasthat its appearing first to the little boy at so tender an age adds a particular touch
but its not the first occurrence of its charming kind that i know to have involved a child
if the child gives the effect another turn of the screw what do you say to two children  we say of course somebody exclaimed that they give two turns
also that we want to hear about them  i can see douglas there before the fire to which he had got up to present his back looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets
nobody but me till now has ever heard
its quite too horrible this naturally was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price and our friend with quiet art prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on its beyond everything
nothing at all that i know touches it  for sheer terror i remember asking
he seemed to say it was not so simple as that to be really at a loss how to qualify it
he passed his hand over his eyes made a little wincing grimace
for dreadfuldreadfulness  oh how delicious cried one of the women
he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
for general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain  well then i said just sit right down and begin  he turned round to the fire gave a kick to a log watched it an instant
then as he faced us again i cant begin
i shall have to send to town there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
the storys written
its in a locked drawerit has not been out for years
i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it  it was to me in particular that he appeared to propound thisappeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate
he had broken a thickness of ice the formation of many a winter had had his reasons for a long silence
the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me
i adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing then i asked him if the experience in question had been his own
to this his answer was prompt
oh thank god no  and is the record yours
you took the thing down  nothing but the impression
i took that herehe tapped his heart
ive never lost it  then your manuscript  is in old faded ink and in the most beautiful hand he hung fire again
a womans
she has been dead these twenty years
she sent me the pages in question before she died they were all listening now and of course there was somebody to be arch or at any rate to draw the inference
but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation
she was a most charming person but she was ten years older than i
she was my sisters governess he quietly said
she was the most agreeable woman ive ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
it was long ago and this episode was long before
i was at trinity and i found her at home on my coming down the second summer
i was much there that yearit was a beautiful one and we had in her offhours some strolls and talks in the gardentalks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice
oh yes dont grin i liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too
if she hadnt she wouldnt have told me
she had never told anyone
it wasnt simply that she said so but that i knew she hadnt
i was sure i could see
youll easily judge why when you hear  because the thing had been such a scare  he continued to fix me
youll easily judge he repeated you will  i fixed him too
i see
she was in love  he laughed for the first time
you are acute
yes she was in love
that is she had been
that came outshe couldnt tell her story without its coming out
i saw it and she saw i saw it but neither of us spoke of it
i remember the time and the placethe corner of the lawn the shade of the great beeches and the long hot summer afternoon
it wasnt a scene for a shudder but oh he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
youll receive the packet thursday morning i inquired
probably not till the second post  well then after dinner  youll all meet me here he looked us round again
isnt anybody going it was almost the tone of hope
everybody will stay  i willand i will cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
mrs griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
who was it she was in love with  the story will tell i took upon myself to reply
oh i cant wait for the story  the story wont tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way  mores the pity then
thats the only way i ever understand  wont you tell douglas somebody else inquired
he sprang to his feet again
yestomorrow
now i must go to bed
good night and quickly catching up a candlestick he left us slightly bewildered
from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair whereupon mrs griffin spoke
well if i dont know who she was in love with i know who he was  she was ten years older said her husband
raison de plusat that age
but its rather nice his long reticence  forty years griffin put in
with this outbreak at last  the outbreak i returned will make a tremendous occasion of thursday night and everyone so agreed with me that in the light of it we lost all attention for everything else
the last story however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial had been told we handshook and candlestuck as somebody said and went to bed
i knew the next day that a letter containing the key had by the first post gone off to his london apartments but in spite ofor perhaps just on account ofthe eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner till such an hour of the evening in fact as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed
then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so
we had it from him again before the fire in the hall as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night
it appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
poor douglas before his deathwhen it was in sightcommitted to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
the departing ladies who had said they would stay didnt of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
but that only made his little final auditory more compact and select kept it round the hearth subject to a common thrill
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun
the fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson had at the age of twenty on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom come up to london in trepidation to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser
this person proved on her presenting herself for judgment at a house in harley street that impressed her as vast and imposingthis prospective patron proved a gentleman a bachelor in the prime of life such a figure as had never risen save in a dream or an old novel before a fluttered anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage
one could easily fix his type it never happily dies out
he was handsome and bold and pleasant offhand and gay and kind
he struck her inevitably as gallant and splendid but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor an obligation he should gratefully incur
she conceived him as rich but as fearfully extravagantsaw him all in a glow of high fashion of good looks of expensive habits of charming ways with women
he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
he had been left by the death of their parents in india guardian to a small nephew and a small niece children of a younger a military brother whom he had lost two years before
these children were by the strangest of chances for a man in his positiona lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patiencevery heavily on his hands
it had all been a great worry and on his own part doubtless a series of blunders but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could had in particular sent them down to his other house the proper place for them being of course the country and kept them there from the first with the best people he could find to look after them parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself whenever he might to see how they were doing
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
he had put them in possession of bly which was healthy and secure and had placed at the head of their little establishmentbut below stairs onlyan excellent woman mrs grose whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother
she was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl of whom without children of her own she was by good luck extremely fond
there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
she would also have in holidays to look after the small boy who had been for a term at schoolyoung as he was to be sent but what else could be doneand who as the holidays were about to begin would be back from one day to the other
there had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose
she had done for them quite beautifullyshe was a most respectable persontill her death the great awkwardness of which had precisely left no alternative but the school for little miles
mrs grose since then in the way of manners and things had done as she could for flora and there were further a cook a housemaid a dairywoman an old pony an old groom and an old gardener all likewise thoroughly respectable
so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question
and what did the former governess die ofof so much respectability  our friends answer was prompt
that will come out
i dont anticipate  excuse mei thought that was just what you are doing  in her successors place i suggested i should have wished to learn if the office brought with it  necessary danger to life douglas completed my thought
she did wish to learn and she did learn
you shall hear tomorrow what she learned
meanwhile of course the prospect struck her as slightly grim
she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
she hesitatedtook a couple of days to consult and consider
but the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure and on a second interview she faced the music she engaged and douglas with this made a pause that for the benefit of the company moved me to throw in  the moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man
she succumbed to it  he got up and as he had done the night before went to the fire gave a stir to a log with his foot then stood a moment with his back to us
she saw him only twice  yes but thats just the beauty of her passion  a little to my surprise on this douglas turned round to me
it was the beauty of it
there were others he went on who hadnt succumbed
he told her frankly all his difficultythat for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive
they were somehow simply afraid
it sounded dullit sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition  which was  that she should never trouble himbut never never neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything only meet all questions herself receive all moneys from his solicitor take the whole thing over and let him alone
she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded  but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
she never saw him again  oh said the lady which as our friend immediately left us again was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair he opened the faded red cover of a thin oldfashioned giltedged album
the whole thing took indeed more nights than one but on the first occasion the same lady put another question
what is your title  i havent one  oh i have i said
but douglas without heeding me had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his authors hand
i   i remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong
after rising in town to meet his appeal i had at all events a couple of very bad daysfound myself doubtful again felt indeed sure i had made a mistake
in this state of mind i spent the long hours of bumping swinging coach that carried me to the stopping place at which i was to be met by a vehicle from the house
this convenience i was told had been ordered and i found toward the close of the june afternoon a commodious fly in waiting for me
driving at that hour on a lovely day through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome my fortitude mounted afresh and as we turned into the avenue encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk
i suppose i had expected or had dreaded something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise
i remember as a most pleasant impression the broad clear front its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out i remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky
the scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home and there immediately appeared at the door with a little girl in her hand a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if i had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor
i had received in harley street a narrower notion of the place and that as i recalled it made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman suggested that what i was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise
i had no drop again till the next day for i was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils
the little girl who accompanied mrs grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her
she was the most beautiful child i had ever seen and i afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her
i slept little that nighti was too much excited and this astonished me too i recollect remained with me adding to my sense of the liberality with which i was treated
the large impressive room one of the best in the house the great state bed as i almost felt it the full figured draperies the long glasses in which for the first time i could see myself from head to foot all struck melike the extraordinary charm of my small chargeas so many things thrown in
it was thrown in as well from the first moment that i should get on with mrs grose in a relation over which on my way in the coach i fear i had rather brooded
the only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me
i perceived within half an hour that she was so gladstout simple plain clean wholesome womanas to be positively on her guard against showing it too much
i wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it and that with reflection with suspicion might of course have made me uneasy
but it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that before morning made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect to watch from my open window the faint summer dawn to look at such portions of the rest of the house as i could catch and to listen while in the fading dusk the first birds began to twitter for the possible recurrence of a sound or two less natural and not without but within that i had fancied i heard
there had been a moment when i believed i recognized faint and far the cry of a child there had been another when i found myself just consciously starting as at the passage before my door of a light footstep
but these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off and it is only in the light or the gloom i should rather say of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me
to watch teach form little flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life
it had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion i should have her as a matter of course at night her small white bed being already arranged to that end in my room
what i had undertaken was the whole care of her and she had remained just this last time with mrs grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity
in spite of this timiditywhich the child herself in the oddest way in the world had been perfectly frank and brave about allowing it without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness with the deep sweet serenity indeed of one of raphaels holy infants to be discussed to be imputed to her and to determine usi feel quite sure she would presently like me
it was part of what i already liked mrs grose herself for the pleasure i could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as i sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil in a high chair and a bib brightly facing me between them over bread and milk
there were naturally things that in floras presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks obscure and roundabout allusions
and the little boydoes he look like her
is he too so very remarkable  one wouldnt flatter a child
oh miss most remarkable
if you think well of this oneand she stood there with a plate in her hand beaming at our companion who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us
yes if i do  you will be carried away by the little gentleman  well that i think is what i came forto be carried away
im afraid however i remember feeling the impulse to add im rather easily carried away
i was carried away in london  i can still see mrs groses broad face as she took this in
in harley street  in harley street  well miss youre not the firstand you wont be the last  oh ive no pretension i could laugh to being the only one
my other pupil at any rate as i understand comes back tomorrow  not tomorrowfriday miss
he arrives as you did by the coach under care of the guard and is to be met by the same carriage  i forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance i should be in waiting for him with his little sister an idea in which mrs grose concurred so heartily that i somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledgenever falsified thank heaventhat we should on every question be quite at one
oh she was glad i was there
what i felt the next day was i suppose nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale as i walked round them gazed up at them took them in of my new circumstances
they had as it were an extent and mass for which i had not been prepared and in the presence of which i found myself freshly a little scared as well as a little proud
lessons in this agitation certainly suffered some delay i reflected that my first duty was by the gentlest arts i could contrive to win the child into the sense of knowing me
i spent the day with her outofdoors i arranged with her to her great satisfaction that it should be she she only who might show me the place
she showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret with droll delightful childish talk about it and with the result in half an hour of our becoming immense friends
young as she was i was struck throughout our little tour with her confidence and courage with the way in empty chambers and dull corridors on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy her morning music her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked rang out and led me on
i have not seen bly since the day i left it and i daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted
but as my little conductress with her hair of gold and her frock of blue danced before me round corners and pattered down passages i had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite such a place as would somehow for diversion of the young idea take all color out of storybooks and fairytales
wasnt it just a storybook over which i had fallen adoze and adream
no it was a big ugly antique but convenient house embodying a few features of a building still older halfreplaced and halfutilized in which i had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship
well i was strangely at the helm
ii   this came home to me when two days later i drove over with flora to meet as mrs grose said the little gentleman and all the more for an incident that presenting itself the second evening had deeply disconcerted me
the first day had been on the whole as i have expressed reassuring but i was to see it wind up in keen apprehension
the postbag that eveningit came latecontained a letter for me which however in the hand of my employer i found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another addressed to himself with a seal still unbroken
this i recognize is from the headmaster and the headmasters an awful bore
read him please deal with him but mind you dont report
not a word
im off i broke the seal with a great effortso great a one that i was a long time coming to it took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed
i had better have let it wait till morning for it gave me a second sleepless night
with no counsel to take the next day i was full of distress and it finally got so the better of me that i determined to open myself at least to mrs grose
what does it mean
the childs dismissed his school  she gave me a look that i remarked at the moment then visibly with a quick blankness seemed to try to take it back
but arent they all  sent homeyes
but only for the holidays
miles may never go back at all  consciously under my attention she reddened
they wont take him  they absolutely decline  at this she raised her eyes which she had turned from me i saw them fill with good tears
what has he done  i hesitated then i judged best simply to hand her my letterwhich however had the effect of making her without taking it simply put her hands behind her
she shook her head sadly
such things are not for me miss  my counselor couldnt read
i winced at my mistake which i attenuated as i could and opened my letter again to repeat it to her then faltering in the act and folding it up once more i put it back in my pocket
is he really bad  the tears were still in her eyes
do the gentlemen say so  they go into no particulars
they simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him
that can have only one meaning  mrs grose listened with dumb emotion she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be so that presently to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind i went on that hes an injury to the others  at this with one of the quick turns of simple folk she suddenly flamed up
master miles
him an injury  there was such a flood of good faith in it that though i had not yet seen the child my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea
i found myself to meet my friend the better offering it on the spot sarcastically
to his poor little innocent mates  its too dreadful cried mrs grose to say such cruel things
why hes scarce ten years old  yes yes it would be incredible  she was evidently grateful for such a profession
see him miss first
then believe it i felt forthwith a new impatience to see him it was the beginning of a curiosity that for all the next hours was to deepen almost to pain
mrs grose was aware i could judge of what she had produced in me and she followed it up with assurance
you might as well believe it of the little lady
bless her she added the next momentlook at her  i turned and saw that flora whom ten minutes before i had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper a pencil and a copy of nice round os now presented herself to view at the open door
she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties looking to me however with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person which had rendered necessary that she should follow me
i needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of mrs groses comparison and catching my pupil in my arms covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement
nonetheless the rest of the day i watched for further occasion to approach my colleague especially as toward evening i began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me
i overtook her i remember on the staircase we went down together and at the bottom i detained her holding her there with a hand on her arm
i take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that youve never known him to be bad  she threw back her head she had clearly by this time and very honestly adopted an attitude
oh never known himi dont pretend that  i was upset again
then you have known him  yes indeed miss thank god  on reflection i accepted this
you mean that a boy who never is  is no boy for me  i held her tighter
you like them with the spirit to be naughty then keeping pace with her answer so do i i eagerly brought out
but not to the degree to contaminate  to contaminatemy big word left her at a loss
i explained it
to corrupt  she stared taking my meaning in but it produced in her an odd laugh
are you afraid hell corrupt you she put the question with such a fine bold humor that with a laugh a little silly doubtless to match her own i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule
but the next day as the hour for my drive approached i cropped up in another place
what was the lady who was here before  the last governess
she was also young and prettyalmost as young and almost as pretty miss even as you  ah then i hope her youth and her beauty helped her i recollect throwing off
he seems to like us young and pretty  oh he did mrs grose assented it was the way he liked everyone  she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up
i mean thats his waythe masters  i was struck
but of whom did you speak first  she looked blank but she colored
why of him  of the master  of who else  there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant and i merely asked what i wanted to know
did she see anything in the boy  that wasnt right
she never told me  i had a scruple but i overcame it
was she carefulparticular  mrs grose appeared to try to be conscientious
about some thingsyes  but not about all  again she considered
well missshes gone
i wont tell tales  i quite understand your feeling i hastened to reply but i thought it after an instant not opposed to this concession to pursue did she die here  noshe went off  i dont know what there was in this brevity of mrs groses that struck me as ambiguous
went off to die mrs grose looked straight out of the window but i felt that hypothetically i had a right to know what young persons engaged for bly were expected to do
she was taken ill you mean and went home  she was not taken ill so far as appeared in this house
she left it at the end of the year to go home as she said for a short holiday to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right
we had then a young womana nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever and she took the children altogether for the interval
but our young lady never came back and at the very moment i was expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead  i turned this over
but of what  he never told me
but please miss said mrs grose i must get to my work     iii   her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not for my just preoccupations a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem
we met after i had brought home little miles more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction my general emotion so monstrous was i then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict
i was a little late on the scene and i felt as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down that i had seen him on the instant without and within in the great glow of freshness the same positive fragrance of purity in which i had from the first moment seen his little sister
he was incredibly beautiful and mrs grose had put her finger on it everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence
what i then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that i have never found to the same degree in any childhis indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love
it would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence and by the time i had got back to bly with him i remained merely bewilderedso far that is as i was not outragedby the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room in a drawer
as soon as i could compass a private word with mrs grose i declared to her that it was grotesque
she promptly understood me
you mean the cruel charge  it doesnt live an instant
my dear woman look at him  she smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm
i assure you miss i do nothing else
what will you say then she immediately added
in answer to the letter i had made up my mind
nothing  and to his uncle  i was incisive
nothing  and to the boy himself  i was wonderful
nothing  she gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth
then ill stand by you
well see it out  well see it out i ardently echoed giving her my hand to make it a vow
she held me there a moment then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand
would you mind miss if i used the freedom  to kiss me
no i took the good creature in my arms and after we had embraced like sisters felt still more fortified and indignant
this at all events was for the time a time so full that as i recall the way it went it reminds me of all the art i now need to make it a little distinct
what i look back at with amazement is the situation i accepted
i had undertaken with my companion to see it out and i was under a charm apparently that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort
i was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity
i found it simple in my ignorance my confusion and perhaps my conceit to assume that i could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning
i am unable even to remember at this day what proposal i framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies
lessons with me indeed that charming summer we all had a theory that he was to have but i now feel that for weeks the lessons must have been rather my own
i learned somethingat first certainlythat had not been one of the teachings of my small smothered life learned to be amused and even amusing and not to think for the morrow
it was the first time in a manner that i had known space and air and freedom all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature
and then there was considerationand consideration was sweet
oh it was a trapnot designed but deepto my imagination to my delicacy perhaps to my vanity to whatever in me was most excitable
the best way to picture it all is to say that i was off my guard
they gave me so little troublethey were of a gentleness so extraordinary
i used to speculatebut even this with a dim disconnectednessas to how the rough future for all futures are rough
would handle them and might bruise them
they had the bloom of health and happiness and yet as if i had been in charge of a pair of little grandees of princes of the blood for whom everything to be right would have to be enclosed and protected the only form that in my fancy the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic a really royal extension of the garden and the park
it may be of course above all that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillnessthat hush in which something gathers or crouches
the change was actually like the spring of a beast
in the first weeks the days were long they often at their finest gave me what i used to call my own hour the hour when for my pupils teatime and bedtime having come and gone i had before my final retirement a small interval alone
much as i liked my companions this hour was the thing in the day i liked most and i liked it best of all when as the light fadedor rather i should say the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded in a flushed sky from the old treesi could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me the beauty and dignity of the place
it was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my discretion my quiet good sense and general high propriety i was giving pleasureif he ever thought of itto the person to whose pressure i had responded
what i was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me and that i could after all do it proved even a greater joy than i had expected
i daresay i fancied myself in short a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear
well i needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign
it was plump one afternoon in the middle of my very hour the children were tucked away and i had come out for my stroll
one of the thoughts that as i dont in the least shrink now from noting used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone
someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve
i didnt ask more than thati only asked that he should know and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it and the kind light of it in his handsome face
that was exactly present to meby which i mean the face waswhen on the first of these occasions at the end of a long june day i stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house
what arrested me on the spotand with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed forwas the sense that my imagination had in a flash turned real
he did stand therebut high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which on that first morning little flora had conducted me
this tower was one of a pairsquare incongruous crenelated structuresthat were distinguished for some reason though i could see little difference as the new and the old
they flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious dating in their gingerbread antiquity from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past
i admired them had fancies about them for we could all profit in a degree especially when they loomed through the dusk by the grandeur of their actual battlements yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure i had so often invoked seemed most in place
it produced in me this figure in the clear twilight i remember two distinct gasps of emotion which were sharply the shock of my first and that of my second surprise
my second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first the man who met my eyes was not the person i had precipitately supposed
there came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which after these years there is no living view that i can hope to give
an unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred and the figure that faced me wasa few more seconds assured meas little anyone else i knew as it was the image that had been in my mind
i had not seen it in harley streeti had not seen it anywhere
the place moreover in the strangest way in the world had on the instant and by the very fact of its appearance become a solitude
to me at least making my statement here with a deliberation with which i have never made it the whole feeling of the moment returns
it was as if while i took inwhat i did take inall the rest of the scene had been stricken with death
i can hear again as i write the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped
the rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the friendly hour lost for the minute all its voice
but there was no other change in nature unless indeed it were a change that i saw with a stranger sharpness
the gold was still in the sky the clearness in the air and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame
thats how i thought with extraordinary quickness of each person that he might have been and that he was not
we were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel as an effect of my inability to say a wonder that in a few instants more became intense
the great question or one of these is afterward i know with regard to certain matters the question of how long they have lasted
well this matter of mine think what you will of it lasted while i caught at a dozen possibilities none of which made a difference for the better that i could see in there having been in the houseand for how long above alla person of whom i was in ignorance
it lasted while i just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person
it lasted while this visitant at all eventsand there was a touch of the strange freedom as i remember in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hatseemed to fix me from his position with just the question just the scrutiny through the fading light that his own presence provoked
we were too far apart to call to each other but there was a moment at which at shorter range some challenge between us breaking the hush would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare
he was in one of the angles the one away from the house very erect as it struck me and with both hands on the ledge
so i saw him as i see the letters i form on this page then exactly after a minute as if to add to the spectacle he slowly changed his placepassed looking at me hard all the while to the opposite corner of the platform
yes i had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me and i can see at this moment the way his hand as he went passed from one of the crenelations to the next
he stopped at the other corner but less long and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me
he turned away that was all i knew
iv   it was not that i didnt wait on this occasion for more for i was rooted as deeply as i was shaken
was there a secret at blya mystery of udolpho or an insane an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement
i cant say how long i turned it over or how long in a confusion of curiosity and dread i remained where i had had my collision i only recall that when i reentered the house darkness had quite closed in
agitation in the interval certainly had held me and driven me for i must in circling about the place have walked three miles but i was to be later on so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill
the most singular part of it in factsingular as the rest had beenwas the part i became in the hall aware of in meeting mrs grose
this picture comes back to me in the general trainthe impression as i received it on my return of the wide white panelled space bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet and of the good surprised look of my friend which immediately told me she had missed me
it came to me straightway under her contact that with plain heartiness mere relieved anxiety at my appearance she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident i had there ready for her
i had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up and i somehow measured the importance of what i had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it
scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one as i may say with the instinct of sparing my companion
on the spot accordingly in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me i for a reason that i couldnt then have phrased achieved an inward resolutionoffered a vague pretext for my lateness and with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet went as soon as possible to my room
here it was another affair here for many days after it was a queer affair enough
there were hours from day to dayor at least there were moments snatched even from clear dutieswhen i had to shut myself up to think
it was not so much yet that i was more nervous than i could bear to be as that i was remarkably afraid of becoming so for the truth i had now to turn over was simply and clearly the truth that i could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom i had been so inexplicably and yet as it seemed to me so intimately concerned
it took little time to see that i could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications
the shock i had suffered must have sharpened all my senses i felt sure at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention that i had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any game  of whatever it was that i knew nothing was known around me
there was but one sane inference someone had taken a liberty rather gross
that was what repeatedly i dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself
we had been collectively subject to an intrusion some unscrupulous traveler curious in old houses had made his way in unobserved enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then stolen out as he came
if he had given me such a bold hard stare that was but a part of his indiscretion
the good thing after all was that we should surely see no more of him
this was not so good a thing i admit as not to leave me to judge that what essentially made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work
my charming work was just my life with miles and flora and through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could throw myself into it in trouble
the attraction of my small charges was a constant joy leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office
there was to be no gray prose it appeared and no long grind so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty
it was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom
i dont mean by this of course that we studied only fiction and verse i mean i can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired
how can i describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to themand its a marvel for a governess i call the sisterhood to witnessi made constant fresh discoveries
there was one direction assuredly in which these discoveries stopped deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boys conduct at school
it had been promptly given me i have noted to face that mystery without a pang
perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say thatwithout a wordhe himself had cleared it up
he had made the whole charge absurd
my conclusion bloomed there with the real rose flush of his innocence he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid unclean school world and he had paid a price for it
i reflected acutely that the sense of such differences such superiorities of quality always on the part of the majoritywhich could include even stupid sordid headmastersturn infallibly to the vindictive
both the children had a gentleness it was their only fault and it never made miles a muff that kept themhow shall i express italmost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable
they were like the cherubs of the anecdote who hadmorally at any ratenothing to whack
i remember feeling with miles in especial as if he had had as it were no history
we expect of a small child a scant one but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive yet extraordinarily happy that more than in any creature of his age i have seen struck me as beginning anew each day
he had never for a second suffered
i took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised
if he had been wicked he would have caught it and i should have caught it by the reboundi should have found the trace
i found nothing at all and he was therefore an angel
he never spoke of his school never mentioned a comrade or a master and i for my part was quite too much disgusted to allude to them
of course i was under the spell and the wonderful part is that even at the time i perfectly knew i was
but i gave myself up to it it was an antidote to any pain and i had more pains than one
i was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home where things were not going well
but with my children what things in the world mattered
that was the question i used to put to my scrappy retirements
i was dazzled by their loveliness
there was a sundayto get onwhen it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church in consequence of which as the day declined i had arranged with mrs grose that should the evening show improvement we would attend together the late service
the rain happily stopped and i prepared for our walk which through the park and by the good road to the village would be a matter of twenty minutes
coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall i remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received themwith a publicity perhaps not edifyingwhile i sat with the children at their tea served on sundays by exception in that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass the grownup dining room
the gloves had been dropped there and i turned in to recover them
the day was gray enough but the afternoon light still lingered and it enabled me on crossing the threshold not only to recognize on a chair near the wide window then closed the articles i wanted but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in
one step into the room had sufficed my vision was instantaneous it was all there
the person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me
he appeared thus again with i wont say greater distinctness for that was impossible but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me as i met him catch my breath and turn cold
he was the samehe was the same and seen this time as he had been seen before from the waist up the window though the dining room was on the ground floor not going down to the terrace on which he stood
his face was close to the glass yet the effect of this better view was strangely only to show me how intense the former had been
he remained but a few secondslong enough to convince me he also saw and recognized but it was as if i had been looking at him for years and had known him always
something however happened this time that had not happened before his stare into my face through the glass and across the room was as deep and hard as then but it quitted me for a moment during which i could still watch it see it fix successively several other things
on the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there
he had come for someone else
the flash of this knowledgefor it was knowledge in the midst of dreadproduced in me the most extraordinary effect started as i stood there a sudden vibration of duty and courage
i say courage because i was beyond all doubt already far gone
i bounded straight out of the door again reached that of the house got in an instant upon the drive and passing along the terrace as fast as i could rush turned a corner and came full in sight
but it was in sight of nothing nowmy visitor had vanished
i stopped i almost dropped with the real relief of this but i took in the whole scenei gave him time to reappear
i call it time but how long was it
i cant speak to the purpose today of the duration of these things
that kind of measure must have left me they couldnt have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last
the terrace and the whole place the lawn and the garden beyond it all i could see of the park were empty with a great emptiness
there were shrubberies and big trees but i remember the clear assurance i felt that none of them concealed him
he was there or was not there not there if i didnt see him
i got hold of this then instinctively instead of returning as i had come went to the window
it was confusedly present to me that i ought to place myself where he had stood
i did so i applied my face to the pane and looked as he had looked into the room
as if at this moment to show me exactly what his range had been mrs grose as i had done for himself just before came in from the hall
with this i had the full image of a repetition of what had already occurred
she saw me as i had seen my own visitant she pulled up short as i had done i gave her something of the shock that i had received
she turned white and this made me ask myself if i had blanched as much
she stared in short and retreated on just my lines and i knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that i should presently meet her
i remained where i was and while i waited i thought of more things than one
but theres only one i take space to mention
i wondered why she should be scared
v   oh she let me know as soon as round the corner of the house she loomed again into view
what in the name of goodness is the matter  she was now flushed and out of breath
i said nothing till she came quite near
with me i must have made a wonderful face
do i show it  youre as white as a sheet
you look awful  i considered i could meet on this without scruple any innocence
my need to respect the bloom of mrs groses had dropped without a rustle from my shoulders and if i wavered for the instant it was not with what i kept back
i put out my hand to her and she took it i held her hard a little liking to feel her close to me
there was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise
you came for me for church of course but i cant go  has anything happened  yes
you must know now
did i look very queer  through this window
dreadful  well i said ive been frightened mrs groses eyes expressed plainly that she had no wish to be yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience
oh it was quite settled that she must share
just what you saw from the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that
what i sawjust beforewas much worse  her hand tightened
what was it  an extraordinary man
looking in  what extraordinary man  i havent the least idea  mrs grose gazed round us in vain
then where is he gone  i know still less  have you seen him before  yesonce
on the old tower  she could only look at me harder
do you mean hes a stranger  oh very much  yet you didnt tell me  nofor reasons
but now that youve guessed  mrs groses round eyes encountered this charge
ah i havent guessed she said very simply
how can i if you dont imagine  i dont in the very least  youve seen him nowhere but on the tower  and on this spot just now  mrs grose looked round again
what was he doing on the tower  only standing there and looking down at me  she thought a minute
was he a gentleman  i found i had no need to think
no she gazed in deeper wonder
no  then nobody about the place
nobody from the village  nobodynobody
i didnt tell you but i made sure  she breathed a vague relief this was oddly so much to the good
it only went indeed a little way
but if he isnt a gentleman  what is he
hes a horror  a horror  hesgod help me if i know what he is  mrs grose looked round once more she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance then pulling herself together turned to me with abrupt inconsequence
its time we should be at church  oh im not fit for church  wont it do you good  it wont do them
i nodded at the house
the children  i cant leave them now  youre afraid  i spoke boldly
im afraid of him  mrs groses large face showed me at this for the first time the faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute i somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea i myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me
it comes back to me that i thought instantly of this as something i could get from her and i felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more
when was iton the tower  about the middle of the month
at this same hour  almost at dark said mrs grose
oh no not nearly
i saw him as i see you  then how did he get in  and how did he get out i laughed
i had no opportunity to ask him
this evening you see i pursued he has not been able to get in  he only peeps  i hope it will be confined to that she had now let go my hand she turned away a little
i waited an instant then i brought out go to church
goodbye
i must watch  slowly she faced me again
do you fear for them  we met in another long look
dont you instead of answering she came nearer to the window and for a minute applied her face to the glass
you see how he could see i meanwhile went on
she didnt move
how long was he here  till i came out
i came to meet him  mrs grose at last turned round and there was still more in her face
i couldnt have come out  neither could i i laughed again
but i did come
i have my duty  so have i mine she replied after which she added what is he like  ive been dying to tell you
but hes like nobody  nobody she echoed
he has no hat then seeing in her face that she already in this with a deeper dismay found a touch of picture i quickly added stroke to stroke
he has red hair very red closecurling and a pale face long in shape with straight good features and little rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair
his eyebrows are somehow darker they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal
his eyes are sharp strangeawfully but i only know clearly that theyre rather small and very fixed
his mouths wide and his lips are thin and except for his little whiskers hes quite cleanshaven
he gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor  an actor it was impossible to resemble one less at least than mrs grose at that moment
ive never seen one but so i suppose them
hes tall active erect  i continued but neverno nevera gentleman  my companions face had blanched as i went on her round eyes started and her mild mouth gaped
a gentleman she gasped confounded stupefied a gentleman he  you know him then  she visibly tried to hold herself
but he is handsome  i saw the way to help her
remarkably  and dressed  in somebodys clothes theyre smart but theyre not his own  she broke into a breathless affirmative groan theyre the masters  i caught it up
you do know him  she faltered but a second
quint she cried
quint  peter quinthis own man his valet when he was here  when the master was  gaping still but meeting me she pieced it all together
he never wore his hat but he did wearwell there were waistcoats missed
they were both herelast year
then the master went and quint was alone  i followed but halting a little
alone  alone with us then as from a deeper depth in charge she added
and what became of him  she hung fire so long that i was still more mystified
he went too  she brought out at last
went where  her expression at this became extraordinary
god knows where
he died  died i almost shrieked
she seemed fairly to square herself plant herself more firmly to utter the wonder of it
yes
mr quint is dead     vi   it took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we couldmy dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified and my companions knowledge hencefortha knowledge half consternation and half compassionof that liability
there had been this evening after the revelation left me for an hour so prostratethere had been for either of us no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows of prayers and promises a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out
the result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements
she herself had seen nothing not the shadow of a shadow and nobody in the house but the governess was in the governesss plight yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as i gave it to her and ended by showing me on this ground an awestricken tenderness an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities
what was settled between us accordingly that night was that we thought we might bear things together and i was not even sure that in spite of her exemption it was she who had the best of the burden
i knew at this hour i think as well as i knew later what i was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract
i was queer company enoughquite as queer as the company i received but as i trace over what we went through i see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that by good fortune could steady us
it was the idea the second movement that led me straight out as i may say of the inner chamber of my dread
i could take the air in the court at least and there mrs grose could join me
perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night
we had gone over and over every feature of what i had seen
he was looking for someone else you saysomeone who was not you  he was looking for little miles a portentous clearness now possessed me
thats whom he was looking for  but how do you know  i know i know i know my exaltation grew
and you know my dear  she didnt deny this but i required i felt not even so much telling as that
she resumed in a moment at any rate what if he should see him  little miles
thats what he wants  she looked immensely scared again
the child  heaven forbid
the man
he wants to appear to them that he might was an awful conception and yet somehow i could keep it at bay which moreover as we lingered there was what i succeeded in practically proving
i had an absolute certainty that i should see again what i had already seen but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience by accepting by inviting by surmounting it all i should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions
the children in especial i should thus fence about and absolutely save
i recall one of the last things i said that night to mrs grose
it does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned  she looked at me hard as i musingly pulled up
his having been here and the time they were with him  the time they were with him and his name his presence his history in any way  oh the little lady doesnt remember
she never heard or knew  the circumstances of his death i thought with some intensity
perhaps not
but miles would remembermiles would know  ah dont try him broke from mrs grose
i returned her the look she had given me
dont be afraid i continued to think
it is rather odd  that he has never spoken of him  never by the least allusion
and you tell me they were great friends  oh it wasnt him mrs grose with emphasis declared
it was quints own fancy
to play with him i meanto spoil him she paused a moment then she added quint was much too free  this gave me straight from my vision of his facesuch a facea sudden sickness of disgust
too free with my boy  too free with everyone  i forbore for the moment to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household of the halfdozen maids and men who were still of our small colony
but there was everything for our apprehension in the lucky fact that no discomfortable legend no perturbation of scullions had ever within anyones memory attached to the kind old place
it had neither bad name nor ill fame and mrs grose most apparently only desired to cling to me and to quake in silence
i even put her the very last thing of all to the test
it was when at midnight she had her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave
i have it from you thenfor its of great importancethat he was definitely and admittedly bad  oh not admittedly
i knew itbut the master didnt  and you never told him  well he didnt like talebearinghe hated complaints
he was terribly short with anything of that kind and if people were all right to him  he wouldnt be bothered with more this squared well enough with my impressions of him he was not a troubleloving gentleman nor so very particular perhaps about some of the company he kept
all the same i pressed my interlocutress
i promise you i would have told  she felt my discrimination
i daresay i was wrong
but really i was afraid  afraid of what  of things that man could do
quint was so cleverhe was so deep  i took this in still more than probably i showed
you werent afraid of anything else
not of his effect  his effect she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while i faltered
on innocent little precious lives
they were in your charge  no they were not in mine she roundly and distressfully returned
the master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well and the country air so good for him
so he had everything to say
yesshe let me have iteven about them  themthat creature i had to smother a kind of howl
and you could bear it  no
i couldntand i cant now and the poor woman burst into tears
a rigid control from the next day was as i have said to follow them yet how often and how passionately for a week we came back together to the subject
much as we had discussed it that sunday night i was in the immediate later hours in especialfor it may be imagined whether i sleptstill haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me
i myself had kept back nothing but there was a word mrs grose had kept back
i was sure moreover by morning that this was not from a failure of frankness but because on every side there were fears
it seems to me indeed in retrospect that by the time the morrows sun was high i had restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences
what they gave me above all was just the sinister figure of the living manthe dead one would keep awhileand of the months he had continuously passed at bly which added up made a formidable stretch
the limit of this evil time had arrived only when on the dawn of a winters morning peter quint was found by a laborer going to early work stone dead on the road from the village a catastrophe explainedsuperficially at leastby a visible wound to his head such a wound as might have been producedand as on the final evidence had beenby a fatal slip in the dark and after leaving the public house on the steepish icy slope a wrong path altogether at the bottom of which he lay
the icy slope the turn mistaken at night and in liquor accounted for muchpractically in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter for everything but there had been matters in his lifestrange passages and perils secret disorders vices more than suspectedthat would have accounted for a good deal more
i scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind but i was in these days literally able to find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of me
i now saw that i had been asked for a service admirable and difficult and there would be a greatness in letting it be seenoh in the right quarterthat i could succeed where many another girl might have failed
it was an immense help to mei confess i rather applaud myself as i look backthat i saw my service so strongly and so simply
i was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit a deep constant ache of ones own committed heart
we were cut off really together we were united in our danger
they had nothing but me and iwell i had them
it was in short a magnificent chance
this chance presented itself to me in an image richly material
i was a screeni was to stand before them
the more i saw the less they would
i began to watch them in a stifled suspense a disguised excitement that might well had it continued too long have turned to something like madness
what saved me as i now see was that it turned to something else altogether
it didnt last as suspenseit was superseded by horrible proofs
proofs i say yesfrom the moment i really took hold
this moment dated from an afternoon hour that i happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone
we had left miles indoors on the red cushion of a deep window seat he had wished to finish a book and i had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless
his sister on the contrary had been alert to come out and i strolled with her half an hour seeking the shade for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally warm
i was aware afresh with her as we went of how like her brother she contrivedit was the charming thing in both childrento let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround
they were never importunate and yet never listless
my attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer
i walked in a world of their inventionthey had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine so that my time was taken only with being for them some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely thanks to my superior my exalted stamp a happy and highly distinguished sinecure
i forget what i was on the present occasion i only remember that i was something very important and very quiet and that flora was playing very hard
we were on the edge of the lake and as we had lately begun geography the lake was the sea of azof
suddenly in these circumstances i became aware that on the other side of the sea of azof we had an interested spectator
the way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the worldthe strangest that is except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself
i had sat down with a piece of workfor i was something or other that could siton the old stone bench which overlooked the pond and in this position i began to take in with certitude and yet without direct vision the presence at a distance of a third person
the old trees the thick shrubbery made a great and pleasant shade but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot still hour
there was no ambiguity in anything none whatever at least in the conviction i from one moment to another found myself forming as to what i should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes
they were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which i was engaged and i can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move them till i should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my mind what to do
there was an alien object in viewa figure whose right of presence i instantly passionately questioned
i recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities reminding myself that nothing was more natural for instance then the appearance of one of the men about the place or even of a messenger a postman or a tradesmans boy from the village
that reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as i was consciousstill even without lookingof its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor
nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not
of the positive identity of the apparition i would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second meanwhile with an effort that was already sharp enough i transferred my eyes straight to little flora who at the moment was about ten yards away
my heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see and i held my breath while i waited for what a cry from her what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm would tell me
i waited but nothing came then in the first placeand there is something more dire in this i feel than in anything i have to relatei was determined by a sense that within a minute all sounds from her had previously dropped and in the second by the circumstance that also within the minute she had in her play turned her back to the water
this was her attitude when i at last looked at herlooked with the confirmed conviction that we were still together under direct personal notice
she had picked up a small flat piece of wood which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make the thing a boat
this second morsel as i watched her she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place
my apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some seconds i felt i was ready for more
then i again shifted my eyesi faced what i had to face
vii   i got hold of mrs grose as soon after this as i could and i can give no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval
yet i still hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms they knowits too monstrous they know they know  and what on earth i felt her incredulity as she held me
why all that we knowand heaven knows what else besides then as she released me i made it out to her made it out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself
two hours ago in the gardeni could scarce articulateflora saw  mrs grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach
she has told you she panted
not a wordthats the horror
she kept it to herself
the child of eight that child unutterable still for me was the stupefaction of it
mrs grose of course could only gape the wider
then how do you know  i was therei saw with my eyes saw that she was perfectly aware  do you mean aware of him  noof her i was conscious as i spoke that i looked prodigious things for i got the slow reflection of them in my companions face
another personthis time but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror and evil a woman in black pale and dreadfulwith such an air also and such a faceon the other side of the lake
i was there with the childquiet for the hour and in the midst of it she came  came howfrom where  from where they come from
she just appeared and stood therebut not so near  and without coming nearer  oh for the effect and the feeling she might have been as close as you  my friend with an odd impulse fell back a step
was she someone youve never seen  yes
but someone the child has
someone you have then to show how i had thought it all out my predecessorthe one who died  miss jessel  miss jessel
you dont believe me i pressed
she turned right and left in her distress
how can you be sure  this drew from me in the state of my nerves a flash of impatience
then ask florashes sure but i had no sooner spoken than i caught myself up
no for gods sake dont
shell say she isntshell lie  mrs grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest
ah how can you  because im clear
flora doesnt want me to know  its only then to spare you  no nothere are depths depths
the more i go over it the more i see in it and the more i see in it the more i fear
i dont know what i dont seewhat i dont fear  mrs grose tried to keep up with me
you mean youre afraid of seeing her again  oh no thats nothingnow then i explained
its of not seeing her  but my companion only looked wan
i dont understand you  why its that the child may keep it upand that the child assuredly willwithout my knowing it  at the image of this possibility mrs grose for a moment collapsed yet presently to pull herself together again as if from the positive force of the sense of what should we yield an inch there would really be to give way to
dear dearwe must keep our heads
and after all if she doesnt mind it she even tried a grim joke
perhaps she likes it  likes such thingsa scrap of an infant  isnt it just a proof of her blessed innocence my friend bravely inquired
she brought me for the instant almost round
oh we must clutch at thatwe must cling to it
if it isnt a proof of what you say its a proof ofgod knows what
for the womans a horror of horrors  mrs grose at this fixed her eyes a minute on the ground then at last raising them tell me how you know she said
then you admit its what she was i cried
tell me how you know my friend simply repeated
know
by seeing her
by the way she looked  at you do you meanso wickedly  dear me noi could have borne that
she gave me never a glance
she only fixed the child  mrs grose tried to see it
fixed her  ah with such awful eyes  she stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them
do you mean of dislike  god help us no
of something much worse  worse than dislikethis left her indeed at a loss
with a determinationindescribable
with a kind of fury of intention  i made her turn pale
intention  to get hold of her mrs groseher eyes just lingering on minegave a shudder and walked to the window and while she stood there looking out i completed my statement
thats what flora knows  after a little she turned round
the person was in black you say  in mourningrather poor almost shabby
butyeswith extraordinary beauty i now recognized to what i had at last stroke by stroke brought the victim of my confidence for she quite visibly weighed this
oh handsomevery very i insisted wonderfully handsome
but infamous  she slowly came back to me
miss jesselwas infamous she once more took my hand in both her own holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the increase of alarm i might draw from this disclosure
they were both infamous she finally said
so for a little we faced it once more together and i found absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight
i appreciate i said the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing she appeared to assent to this but still only in silence seeing which i went on i must have it now
of what did she die
come there was something between them  there was everything  in spite of the difference  oh of their rank their conditionshe brought it woefully out
she was a lady  i turned it over i again saw
yesshe was a lady  and he so dreadfully below said mrs grose
i felt that i doubtless neednt press too hard in such company on the place of a servant in the scale but there was nothing to prevent an acceptance of my companions own measure of my predecessors abasement
there was a way to deal with that and i dealt the more readily for my full visionon the evidenceof our employers late clever goodlooking own man impudent assured spoiled depraved
the fellow was a hound  mrs grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense of shades
ive never seen one like him
he did what he wished  with her  with them all  it was as if now in my friends own eyes miss jessel had again appeared
i seemed at any rate for an instant to see their evocation of her as distinctly as i had seen her by the pond and i brought out with decision it must have been also what she wished  mrs groses face signified that it had been indeed but she said at the same time poor womanshe paid for it  then you do know what she died of i asked
noi know nothing
i wanted not to know i was glad enough i didnt and i thanked heaven she was well out of this  yet you had then your idea  of her real reason for leaving
oh yesas to that
she couldnt have stayed
fancy it herefor a governess
and afterward i imaginedand i still imagine
and what i imagine is dreadful  not so dreadful as what i do i replied on which i must have shown heras i was indeed but too consciousa front of miserable defeat
it brought out again all her compassion for me and at the renewed touch of her kindness my power to resist broke down
i burst as i had the other time made her burst into tears she took me to her motherly breast and my lamentation overflowed
i dont do it i sobbed in despair i dont save or shield them
its far worse than i dreamedtheyre lost     viii   what i had said to mrs grose was true enough there were in the matter i had put before her depths and possibilities that i lacked resolution to sound so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies
we were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing elsedifficult indeed as that might be in the face of what in our prodigious experience was least to be questioned
late that night while the house slept we had another talk in my room when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that i had seen exactly what i had seen
to hold her perfectly in the pinch of that i found i had only to ask her how if i had made it up i came to be able to give of each of the persons appearing to me a picture disclosing to the last detail their special marksa portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them
she wished of coursesmall blame to herto sink the whole subject and i was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it
i encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrencefor recurrence we took for grantedi should get used to my danger distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts
it was my new suspicion that was intolerable and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease
on leaving her after my first outbreak i had of course returned to my pupils associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which i had already found to be a thing i could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet
i had simply in other words plunged afresh into floras special society and there become awareit was almost a luxurythat she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached
she had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having cried i had supposed i had brushed away the ugly signs but i could literallyfor the time at all eventsrejoice under this fathomless charity that they had not entirely disappeared
to gaze into the depths of blue of the childs eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which i naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and so far as might be my agitation
i couldnt abjure for merely wanting to but i could repeat to mrs groseas i did there over and over in the small hoursthat with their voices in the air their pressure on ones heart and their fragrant faces against ones cheek everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty
it was a pity that somehow to settle this once for all i had equally to reenumerate the signs of subtlety that in the afternoon by the lake had made a miracle of my show of selfpossession
it was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion i then surprised was a matter for either party of habit
it was a pity that i should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having in my delusion so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as i actually saw mrs grose herself and that she wanted by just so much as she did thus see to make me suppose she didnt and at the same time without showing anything arrive at a guess as to whether i myself did
it was a pity that i needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attentionthe perceptible increase of movement the greater intensity of play the singing the gabbling of nonsense and the invitation to romp
yet if i had not indulged to prove there was nothing in it in this review i should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me
i should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that i was certainwhich was so much to the goodthat i at least had not betrayed myself
i should not have been prompted by stress of need by desperation of mindi scarce know what to call itto invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall
she had told me bit by bit under pressure a great deal but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat and i remember how on this occasionfor the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to helpi felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain
i dont believe anything so horrible i recollect saying no let us put it definitely my dear that i dont
but if i did you know theres a thing i should require now just without sparing you the least bit moreoh not a scrap cometo get out of you
what was it you had in mind when in our distress before miles came back over the letter from his school you said under my insistence that you didnt pretend for him that he had not literally ever been bad
he has not literally ever in these weeks that i myself have lived with him and so closely watched him he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful lovable goodness
therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not as it happened seen an exception to take
what was your exception and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer  it was a dreadfully austere inquiry but levity was not our note and at any rate before the gray dawn admonished us to separate i had got my answer
what my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose
it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of several months quint and the boy had been perpetually together
it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to criticize the propriety to hint at the incongruity of so close an alliance and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to miss jessel
miss jessel had with a most strange manner requested her to mind her business and the good woman had on this directly approached little miles
what she had said to him since i pressed was that she liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station
i pressed again of course at this
you reminded him that quint was only a base menial  as you might say
and it was his answer for one thing that was bad  and for another thing i waited
he repeated your words to quint  no not that
its just what he wouldnt she could still impress upon me
i was sure at any rate she added that he didnt
but he denied certain occasions  what occasions  when they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutorand a very grand oneand miss jessel only for the little lady
when he had gone off with the fellow i mean and spent hours with him  he then prevaricated about ithe said he hadnt her assent was clear enough to cause me to add in a moment i see
he lied  oh mrs grose mumbled
this was a suggestion that it didnt matter which indeed she backed up by a further remark
you see after all miss jessel didnt mind
she didnt forbid him  i considered
did he put that to you as a justification  at this she dropped again
no he never spoke of it  never mentioned her in connection with quint  she saw visibly flushing where i was coming out
well he didnt show anything
he denied she repeated he denied  lord how i pressed her now
so that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches  i dont knowi dont know the poor woman groaned
you do know you dear thing i replied only you havent my dreadful boldness of mind and you keep back out of timidity and modesty and delicacy even the impression that in the past when you had without my aid to flounder about in silence most of all made you miserable
but i shall get it out of you yet
there was something in the boy that suggested to you i continued that he covered and concealed their relation  oh he couldnt prevent  your learning the truth
i daresay
but heavens i fell with vehemence athinking what it shows that they must to that extent have succeeded in making of him  ah nothing thats not nice now mrs grose lugubriously pleaded
i dont wonder you looked queer i persisted when i mentioned to you the letter from his school  i doubt if i looked as queer as you she retorted with homely force
and if he was so bad then as that comes to how is he such an angel now  yes indeedand if he was a fiend at school
how how how
well  i said in my torment you must put it to me again but i shall not be able to tell you for some days
only put it to me again i cried in a way that made my friend stare
there are directions in which i must not for the present let myself go meanwhile i returned to her first examplethe one to which she had just previously referredof the boys happy capacity for an occasional slip
if quinton your remonstrance at the time you speak ofwas a base menial one of the things miles said to you i find myself guessing was that you were another again her admission was so adequate that i continued and you forgave him that  wouldnt you  oh yes and we exchanged there in the stillness a sound of the oddest amusement
then i went on at all events while he was with the man  miss flora was with the woman
it suited them all  it suited me too i felt only too well by which i mean that it suited exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain
but i so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view that i will throw just here no further light on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to mrs grose
his having lied and been impudent are i confess less engaging specimens than i had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man
still i mused they must do for they make me feel more than ever that i must watch  it made me blush the next minute to see in my friends face how much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing
this came out when at the schoolroom door she quitted me
surely you dont accuse him  of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me
ah remember that until further evidence i now accuse nobody then before shutting her out to go by another passage to her own place i must just wait i wound up
ix   i waited and waited and the days as they elapsed took something from my consternation
a very few of them in fact passing in constant sight of my pupils without a fresh incident sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge
i have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing i could actively cultivate and it may be imagined if i neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield
stranger than i can express certainly was the effort to struggle against my new lights it would doubtless have been however a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful
i used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that i thought strange things about them and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark
i trembled lest they should see that they were so immensely more interesting
putting things at the worst at all events as in meditation i so often did any clouding of their innocence could only beblameless and foredoomed as they werea reason the more for taking risks
there were moments when by an irresistible impulse i found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart
as soon as i had done so i used to say to myself what will they think of that
doesnt it betray too much it would have been easy to get into a sad wild tangle about how much i might betray but the real account i feel of the hours of peace that i could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied
for if it occurred to me that i might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them so too i remember wondering if i mightnt see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations
they were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me which after all i could reflect was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged
the homage of which they were so lavish succeeded in truth for my nerves quite as well as if i never appeared to myself as i may say literally to catch them at a purpose in it
they had never i think wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress i meanthough they got their lessons better and better which was naturally what would please her mostin the way of diverting entertaining surprising her reading her passages telling her stories acting her charades pouncing out at her in disguises as animals and historical characters and above all astonishing her by the pieces they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite
i should never get to the bottomwere i to let myself go even nowof the prodigious private commentary all under still more private correction with which in these days i overscored their full hours
they had shown me from the first a facility for everything a general faculty which taking a fresh start achieved remarkable flights
they got their little tasks as if they loved them and indulged from the mere exuberance of the gift in the most unimposed little miracles of memory
they not only popped out at me as tigers and as romans but as shakespeareans astronomers and navigators
this was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which at the present day i am at a loss for a different explanation i allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for miles
what i remember is that i was content not for the time to open the question and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness
he was too clever for a bad governess for a parsons daughter to spoil and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the impression i might have got if i had dared to work it out that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement
if it was easy to reflect however that such a boy could postpone school it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been kicked out by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end
let me add that in their company nowand i was careful almost never to be out of iti could follow no scent very far
we lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals
the musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of catching and repeating
the schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies and when that failed there were confabulations in corners with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to come in as something new
i had had brothers myself and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys
what surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age sex and intelligence so fine a consideration
they were extraordinarily at one and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness
sometimes indeed when i dropped into coarseness i perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away
there is a naive side i suppose in all diplomacy but if my pupils practiced upon me it was surely with the minimum of grossness
it was all in the other quarter that after a lull the grossness broke out
i find that i really hang back but i must take my plunge
in going on with the record of what was hideous at bly i not only challenge the most liberal faithfor which i little care butand this is another matteri renew what i myself suffered i again push my way through it to the end
there came suddenly an hour after which as i look back the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering but i have at least reached the heart of it and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance
one eveningwith nothing to lead up or to prepare iti felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which much lighter then as i have mentioned i should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated
i had not gone to bed i sat reading by a couple of candles
there was a roomful of old books at blylastcentury fiction some of it which to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown but never to so much as that of a stray specimen had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth
i remember that the book i had in my hand was fieldings amelia also that i was wholly awake
i recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch
i figure finally that the white curtain draping in the fashion of those days the head of floras little bed shrouded as i had assured myself long before the perfection of childish rest
i recollect in short that though i was deeply interested in my author i found myself at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room
there was a moment during which i listened reminded of the faint sense i had had the first night of there being something undefinably astir in the house and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the halfdrawn blind
then with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it i laid down my book rose to my feet and taking a candle went straight out of the room and from the passage on which my light made little impression noiselessly closed and locked the door
i can say now neither what determined nor what guided me but i went straight along the lobby holding my candle high till i came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase
at this point i precipitately found myself aware of three things
they were practically simultaneous yet they had flashes of succession
my candle under a bold flourish went out and i perceived by the uncovered window that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary
without it the next instant i saw that there was someone on the stair
i speak of sequences but i required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with quint
the apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window where at sight of me it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden
he knew me as well as i knew him and so in the cold faint twilight with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below we faced each other in our common intensity
he was absolutely on this occasion a living detestable dangerous presence
but that was not the wonder of wonders i reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didnt meet and measure him
i had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment but i had thank god no terror
and he knew i had noti found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this
i felt in a fierce rigor of confidence that if i stood my ground a minute i should ceasefor the time at leastto have him to reckon with and during the minute accordingly the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview hideous just because it was human as human as to have met alone in the small hours in a sleeping house some enemy some adventurer some criminal
it was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave the whole horror huge as it was its only note of the unnatural
if i had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour we still at least would have spoken
something would have passed in life between us if nothing had passed one of us would have moved
the moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even i were in life
i cant express what followed it save by saying that the silence itselfwhich was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strengthbecame the element into which i saw the figure disappear in which i definitely saw it turn as i might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order and pass with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost
x   i remained awhile at the top of the stair but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone he had gone then i returned to my room
the foremost thing i saw there by the light of the candle i had left burning was that floras little bed was empty and on this i caught my breath with all the terror that five minutes before i had been able to resist
i dashed at the place in which i had left her lying and over which for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward then my step to my unutterable relief produced an answering sound i perceived an agitation of the window blind and the child ducking down emerged rosily from the other side of it
she stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls
she looked intensely grave and i had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired the thrill of which had just been so prodigious as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach
you naughty where have you beeninstead of challenging her own irregularity i found myself arraigned and explaining
she herself explained for that matter with the loveliest eagerest simplicity
she had known suddenly as she lay there that i was out of the room and had jumped up to see what had become of me
i had dropped with the joy of her reappearance back into my chairfeeling then and then only a little faint and she had pattered straight over to me thrown herself upon my knee given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep
i remember closing my eyes an instant yieldingly consciously as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own
you were looking for me out of the window i said
you thought i might be walking in the grounds  well you know i thought someone wasshe never blanched as she smiled out that at me
oh how i looked at her now
and did you see anyone  ah no she returned almost with the full privilege of childish inconsequence resentfully though with a long sweetness in her little drawl of the negative
at that moment in the state of my nerves i absolutely believed she lied and if i once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which i might take this up
one of these for a moment tempted me with such singular intensity that to withstand it i must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that wonderfully she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright
why not break out at her on the spot and have it all overgive it to her straight in her lovely little lighted face
you see you see you know that you do and that you already quite suspect i believe it therefore why not frankly confess it to me so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps in the strangeness of our fate where we are and what it means this solicitation dropped alas as it came if i could immediately have succumbed to it i might have spared myselfwell youll see what
instead of succumbing i sprang again to my feet looked at her bed and took a helpless middle way
why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there  flora luminously considered after which with her little divine smile because i dont like to frighten you  but if i had by your idea gone out  she absolutely declined to be puzzled she turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant or at any rate as impersonal as mrs marcet or ninetimesnine
oh but you know she quite adequately answered that you might come back you dear and that you have and after a little when she had got into bed i had for a long time by almost sitting on her to hold her hand to prove that i recognized the pertinence of my return
you may imagine the general complexion from that moment of my nights
i repeatedly sat up till i didnt know when i selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept and stealing out took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where i had last met quint
but i never met him there again and i may as well say at once that i on no other occasion saw him in the house
i just missed on the staircase on the other hand a different adventure
looking down it from the top i once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to me her body halfbowed and her head in an attitude of woe in her hands
i had been there but an instant however when she vanished without looking round at me
i knew nonetheless exactly what dreadful face she had to show and i wondered whether if instead of being above i had been below i should have had for going up the same nerve i had lately shown quint
well there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve
on the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentlemanthey were all numbered nowi had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed from the particular quality of its unexpectedness proved quite my sharpest shock
it was precisely the first night during this series that weary with watching i had felt that i might again without laxity lay myself down at my old hour
i slept immediately and as i afterward knew till about one oclock but when i woke it was to sit straight up as completely roused as if a hand had shook me
i had left a light burning but it was now out and i felt an instant certainty that flora had extinguished it
this brought me to my feet and straight in the darkness to her bed which i found she had left
a glance at the window enlightened me further and the striking of a match completed the picture
the child had again got upthis time blowing out the taper and had again for some purpose of observation or response squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the night
that she now sawas she had not i had satisfied myself the previous timewas proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste i made to get into slippers and into a wrap
hidden protected absorbed she evidently rested on the sillthe casement opened forwardand gave herself up
there was a great still moon to help her and this fact had counted in my quick decision
she was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do
what i on my side had to care for was without disturbing her to reach from the corridor some other window in the same quarter
i got to the door without her hearing me i got out of it closed it and listened from the other side for some sound from her
while i stood in the passage i had my eyes on her brothers door which was but ten steps off and which indescribably produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that i lately spoke of as my temptation
what if i should go straight in and march to his windowwhat if by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my motive i should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my boldness
this thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and pause again
i preternaturally listened i figured to myself what might portentously be i wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch
it was a deep soundless minute at the end of which my impulse failed
he was quiet he might be innocent the risk was hideous i turned away
there was a figure in the groundsa figure prowling for a sight the visitor with whom flora was engaged but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy
i hesitated afresh but on other grounds and only for a few seconds then i had made my choice
there were empty rooms at bly and it was only a question of choosing the right one
the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower onethough high above the gardensin the solid corner of the house that i have spoken of as the old tower
this was a large square chamber arranged with some state as a bedroom the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years though kept by mrs grose in exemplary order been occupied
i had often admired it and i knew my way about in it i had only after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as i could one of the shutters
achieving this transit i uncovered the glass without a sound and applying my face to the pane was able the darkness without being much less than within to see that i commanded the right direction
then i saw something more
the moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person diminished by distance who stood there motionless and as if fascinated looking up to where i had appearedlooking that is not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me
there was clearly another person above methere was a person on the tower but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet
the presence on the lawni felt sick as i made it outwas poor little miles himself
xi   it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs grose the rigor with which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet her privately and the more as we each felt the importance of not provokingon the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the childrenany suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries
i drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect
there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences
she believed me i was sure absolutely if she hadnt i dont know what would have become of me for i couldnt have borne the business alone
but she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability their happiness and cleverness she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble
if they had been at all visibly blighted or battered she would doubtless have grown on tracing it back haggard enough to match them as matters stood however i could feel her when she surveyed them with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look thank the lords mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve
flights of fancy gave place in her mind to a steady fireside glow and i had already begun to perceive how with the development of the conviction thatas time went on without a public accidentour young things could after all look out for themselves she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress
that for myself was a sound simplification i could engage that to the world my face should tell no tales but it would have been in the conditions an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers
at the hour i now speak of she had joined me under pressure on the terrace where with the lapse of the season the afternoon sun was now agreeable and we sat there together while before us at a distance but within call if we wished the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods
they moved slowly in unison below us over the lawn the boy as they went reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch
mrs grose watched them with positive placidity then i caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry
i had made her a receptacle of lurid things but there was an odd recognition of my superioritymy accomplishments and my functionin her patience under my pain
she offered her mind to my disclosures as had i wished to mix a witchs broth and proposed it with assurance she would have held out a large clean saucepan
this had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that in my recital of the events of the night i reached the point of what miles had said to me when after seeing him at such a monstrous hour almost on the very spot where he happened now to be i had gone down to bring him in choosing then at the window with a concentrated need of not alarming the house rather that method than a signal more resonant
i had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which after i had got him into the house the boy met my final articulate challenge
as soon as i appeared in the moonlight on the terrace he had come to me as straight as possible on which i had taken his hand without a word and led him through the dark spaces up the staircase where quint had so hungrily hovered for him along the lobby where i had listened and trembled and so to his forsaken room
not a sound on the way had passed between us and i had wonderedoh how i had wonderedif he were groping about in his little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque
it would tax his invention certainly and i felt this time over his real embarrassment a curious thrill of triumph
it was a sharp trap for the inscrutable
he couldnt play any longer at innocence so how the deuce would he get out of it
there beat in me indeed with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce i should
i was confronted at last as never yet with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note
i remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window uncovered to the moonlight made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a matchi remember how i suddenly dropped sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he really as they say had me
he could do what he liked with all his cleverness to help him so long as i should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears
he had me indeed and in a cleft stick for who would ever absolve me who would consent that i should go unhung if by the faintest tremor of an overture i were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire
no no it was useless to attempt to convey to mrs grose just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here how in our short stiff brush in the dark he fairly shook me with admiration
i was of course thoroughly kind and merciful never never yet had i placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as those with which while i rested against the bed i held him there well under fire
i had no alternative but in form at least to put it to him
you must tell me nowand all the truth
what did you go out for
what were you doing there  i can still see his wonderful smile the whites of his beautiful eyes and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk
if i tell you why will you understand my heart at this leaped into my mouth
would he tell me why
i found no sound on my lips to press it and i was aware of replying only with a vague repeated grimacing nod
he was gentleness itself and while i wagged my head at him he stood there more than ever a little fairy prince
it was his brightness indeed that gave me a respite
would it be so great if he were really going to tell me
well he said at last just exactly in order that you should do this  do what  think mefor a changebad i shall never forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word nor how on top of it he bent forward and kissed me
it was practically the end of everything
i met his kiss and i had to make while i folded him for a minute in my arms the most stupendous effort not to cry
he had given exactly the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it and it was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that as i presently glanced about the room i could say  then you didnt undress at all  he fairly glittered in the gloom
not at all
i sat up and read  and when did you go down  at midnight
when im bad i am bad  i see i seeits charming
but how could you be sure i would know it  oh i arranged that with flora his answers rang out with a readiness
she was to get up and look out  which is what she did do it was i who fell into the trap
so she disturbed you and to see what she was looking at you also lookedyou saw  while you i concurred caught your death in the night air  he literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly to assent
how otherwise should i have been bad enough he asked
then after another embrace the incident and our interview closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that for his joke he had been able to draw upon
xii   the particular impression i had received proved in the morning light i repeat not quite successfully presentable to mrs grose though i reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made before we separated
it all lies in half a dozen words i said to her words that really settle the matter
think you know what i might do he threw that off to show me how good he is
he knows down to the ground what he might do
thats what he gave them a taste of at school  lord you do change cried my friend
i dont changei simply make it out
the four depend upon it perpetually meet
if on either of these last nights you had been with either child you would clearly have understood
the more ive watched and waited the more ive felt that if there were nothing else to make it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each
never by a slip of the tongue have they so much as alluded to either of their old friends any more than miles has alluded to his expulsion
oh yes we may sit here and look at them and they may show off to us there to their fill but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale theyre steeped in their vision of the dead restored
hes not reading to her i declared theyre talking of themtheyre talking horrors
i go on i know as if i were crazy and its a wonder im not
what ive seen would have made you so but it has only made me more lucid made me get hold of still other things  my lucidity must have seemed awful but the charming creatures who were victims of it passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness gave my colleague something to hold on by and i felt how tight she held as without stirring in the breath of my passion she covered them still with her eyes
of what other things have you got hold  why of the very things that have delighted fascinated and yet at bottom as i now so strangely see mystified and troubled me
their more than earthly beauty their absolutely unnatural goodness
its a game  i went on its a policy and a fraud  on the part of little darlings  as yet mere lovely babies
yes mad as that seems the very act of bringing it out really helped me to trace itfollow it all up and piece it all together
they havent been goodtheyve only been absent
it has been easy to live with them because theyre simply leading a life of their own
theyre not minetheyre not ours
theyre his and theyre hers  quints and that womans  quints and that womans
they want to get to them  oh how at this poor mrs grose appeared to study them
but for what  for the love of all the evil that in those dreadful days the pair put into them
and to ply them with that evil still to keep up the work of demons is what brings the others back  laws said my friend under her breath
the exclamation was homely but it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what in the bad timefor there had been a worse even than thismust have occurred
there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in our brace of scoundrels
it was in obvious submission of memory that she brought out after a moment they were rascals
but what can they now do she pursued
do i echoed so loud that miles and flora as they passed at their distance paused an instant in their walk and looked at us
dont they do enough i demanded in a lower tone while the children having smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us resumed their exhibition
we were held by it a minute then i answered they can destroy them at this my companion did turn but the inquiry she launched was a silent one the effect of which was to make me more explicit
they dont know as yet quite howbut theyre trying hard
theyre seen only across as it were and beyondin strange places and on high places the top of towers the roof of houses the outside of windows the further edge of pools but theres a deep design on either side to shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle and the success of the tempters is only a question of time
theyve only to keep to their suggestions of danger  for the children to come  and perish in the attempt mrs grose slowly got up and i scrupulously added unless of course we can prevent  standing there before me while i kept my seat she visibly turned things over
their uncle must do the preventing
he must take them away  and whos to make him  she had been scanning the distance but she now dropped on me a foolish face
you miss  by writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and niece mad  but if they are miss  and if i am myself you mean
thats charming news to be sent him by a governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry  mrs grose considered following the children again
yes he do hate worry
that was the great reason  why those fiends took him in so long
no doubt though his indifference must have been awful
as im not a fiend at any rate i shouldnt take him in  my companion after an instant and for all answer sat down again and grasped my arm
make him at any rate come to you  i stared
to me i had a sudden fear of what she might do
him  he ought to be herehe ought to help  i quickly rose and i think i must have shown her a queerer face than ever yet
you see me asking him for a visit no with her eyes on my face she evidently couldnt
instead of it evenas a woman reads anothershe could see what i myself saw his derision his amusement his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone and for the fine machinery i had set in motion to attract his attention to my slighted charms
she didnt knowno one knewhow proud i had been to serve him and to stick to our terms yet she nonetheless took the measure i think of the warning i now gave her
if you should so lose your head as to appeal to him for me  she was really frightened
yes miss  i would leave on the spot both him and you     xiii   it was all very well to join them but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strengthoffered in close quarters difficulties as insurmountable as before
this situation continued a month and with new aggravations and particular notes the note above all sharper and sharper of the small ironic consciousness on the part of my pupils
it was not i am as sure today as i was sure then my mere infernal imagination it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made in a manner for a long time the air in which we moved
i dont mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar for that was not one of their dangers i do mean on the other hand that the element of the unnamed and untouched became between us greater than any other and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement
it was as if at moments we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop short turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind closing with a little bang that made us look at each otherfor like all bangs it was something louder than we had intendedthe doors we had indiscreetly opened
all roads lead to rome and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground
forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever in especial might survive in memory of the friends little children had lost
there were days when i could have sworn that one of them had with a small invisible nudge said to the other she thinks shell do it this timebut she wont to do it would have been to indulge for instanceand for once in a wayin some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline
they had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history to which i had again and again treated them they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me had had with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father of the furniture and arrangement of our house and of the conversation of the old women of our village
there were things enough taking one with another to chatter about if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round
they pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my memory and nothing else perhaps when i thought of such occasions afterward gave me so the suspicion of being watched from under cover
it was in any case over my life my past and my friends alone that we could take anything like our easea state of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders
i was invitedwith no visible connectionto repeat afresh goody goslings celebrated mot or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the vicarage pony
it was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones that with the turn my matters had now taken my predicament as i have called it grew most sensible
the fact that the days passed for me without another encounter ought it would have appeared to have done something toward soothing my nerves
since the light brush that second night on the upper landing of the presence of a woman at the foot of the stair i had seen nothing whether in or out of the house that one had better not have seen
there was many a corner round which i expected to come upon quint and many a situation that in a merely sinister way would have favored the appearance of miss jessel
the summer had turned the summer had gone the autumn had dropped upon bly and had blown out half our lights
the place with its gray sky and withered garlands its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves was like a theater after the performanceall strewn with crumpled playbills
there were exactly states of the air conditions of sound and of stillness unspeakable impressions of the kind of ministering moment that brought back to me long enough to catch it the feeling of the medium in which that june evening out of doors i had had my first sight of quint and in which too at those other instants i had after seeing him through the window looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery
i recognized the signs the portentsi recognized the moment the spot
but they remained unaccompanied and empty and i continued unmolested if unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had in the most extraordinary fashion not declined but deepened
i had said in my talk with mrs grose on that horrid scene of floras by the lakeand had perplexed her by so sayingthat it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep it
i had then expressed what was vividly in my mind the truth that whether the children really saw or notsince that is it was not yet definitely provedi greatly preferred as a safeguard the fullness of my own exposure
i was ready to know the very worst that was to be known
what i had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be sealed just while theirs were most opened
well my eyes were sealed it appeared at presenta consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank god
there was alas a difficulty about that i would have thanked him with all my soul had i not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils
how can i retrace today the strange steps of my obsession
there were times of our being together when i would have been ready to swear that literally in my presence but with my direct sense of it closed they had visitors who were known and were welcome
then it was that had i not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove greater than the injury to be averted my exultation would have broken out
theyre here theyre here you little wretches i would have cried and you cant deny it now the little wretches denied it with all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness in just the crystal depths of whichlike the flash of a fish in a streamthe mockery of their advantage peeped up
the shock in truth had sunk into me still deeper than i knew on the night when looking out to see either quint or miss jessel under the stars i had beheld the boy over whose rest i watched and who had immediately brought in with himhad straightway there turned it on methe lovely upward look with which from the battlements above me the hideous apparition of quint had played
if it was a question of a scare my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that i made my actual inductions
they harassed me so that sometimes at odd moments i shut myself up audibly to rehearseit was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despairthe manner in which i might come to the point
i approached it from one side and the other while in my room i flung myself about but i always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names
as they died away on my lips i said to myself that i should indeed help them to represent something infamous if by pronouncing them i should violate as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom probably had ever known
when i said to myself they have the manners to be silent and you trusted as you are the baseness to speak i felt myself crimson and i covered my face with my hands
after these secret scenes i chattered more than ever going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious palpable hushes occurredi can call them nothing elsethe strange dizzy lift or swim i try for terms
into a stillness a pause of all life that had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and that i could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano
then it was that the others the outsiders were there
though they were not angels they passed as the french say causing me while they stayed to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough for myself
what it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that whatever i had seen miles and flora saw morethings terrible and unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the past
such things naturally left on the surface for the time a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt and we had all three with repetition got into such splendid training that we went each time almost automatically to mark the close of the incident through the very same movements
it was striking of the children at all events to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to failone or the otherof the precious question that had helped us through many a peril
when do you think he will come
dont you think we ought to writethere was nothing like that inquiry we found by experience for carrying off an awkwardness
he of course was their uncle in harley street and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle
it was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions
he never wrote to themthat may have been selfish but it was a part of the flattery of his trust of me for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort and i held that i carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when i let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises
they were too beautiful to be posted i kept them myself i have them all to this hour
this was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be among us
it was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me
there appears to me moreover as i look back no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that in spite of my tension and of their triumph i never lost patience with them
adorable they must in truth have been i now reflect that i didnt in these days hate them
would exasperation however if relief had longer been postponed finally have betrayed me
it little matters for relief arrived
i call it relief though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation
it was at least change and it came with a rush
xiv   walking to church a certain sunday morning i had little miles at my side and his sister in advance of us and at mrs groses well in sight
it was a crisp clear day the first of its order for some time the night had brought a touch of frost and the autumn air bright and sharp made the church bells almost gay
it was an odd accident of thought that i should have happened at such a moment to be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges
why did they never resent my inexorable my perpetual society
something or other had brought nearer home to me that i had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that in the way our companions were marshaled before me i might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion
i was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes
but all this belongedi mean their magnificent little surrenderjust to the special array of the facts that were most abysmal
turned out for sunday by his uncles tailor who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air miless whole title to independence the rights of his sex and situation were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom i should have had nothing to say
i was by the strangest of chances wondering how i should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred
i call it a revolution because i now see how with the word he spoke the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama and the catastrophe was precipitated
look here my dear you know he charmingly said when in the world please am i going back to school  transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough particularly as uttered in the sweet high casual pipe with which at all interlocutors but above all at his eternal governess he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses
there was something in them that always made one catch and i caught at any rate now so effectually that i stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the road
there was something new on the spot between us and he was perfectly aware that i recognized it though to enable me to do so he had no need to look a whit less candid and charming than usual
i could feel in him how he already from my at first finding nothing to reply perceived the advantage he had gained
i was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time after a minute to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile you know my dear that for a fellow to be with a lady always his my dear was constantly on his lips for me and nothing could have expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which i desired to inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity
it was so respectfully easy
but oh how i felt that at present i must pick my own phrases
i remember that to gain time i tried to laugh and i seemed to see in the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer i looked
and always with the same lady i returned
he neither blanched nor winked
the whole thing was virtually out between us
ah of course shes a jolly perfect lady but after all im a fellow dont you see
thatswell getting on  i lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly
yes youre getting on oh but i felt helpless
i have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed to know that and to play with it
and you cant say ive not been awfully good can you  i laid my hand on his shoulder for though i felt how much better it would have been to walk on i was not yet quite able
no i cant say that miles  except just that one night you know  that one night i couldnt look as straight as he
why when i went downwent out of the house  oh yes
but i forget what you did it for  you forgethe spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish reproach
why it was to show you i could  oh yes you could  and i can again  i felt that i might perhaps after all succeed in keeping my wits about me
certainly
but you wont  no not that again
it was nothing  it was nothing i said
but we must go on  he resumed our walk with me passing his hand into my arm
then when am i going back  i wore in turning it over my most responsible air
were you very happy at school  he just considered
oh im happy enough anywhere  well then i quavered if youre just as happy here  ah but that isnt everything
of course you know a lot  but you hint that you know almost as much i risked as he paused
not half i want to miles honestly professed
but it isnt so much that  what is it then  welli want to see more life  i see i see we had arrived within sight of the church and of various persons including several of the household of bly on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in
i quickened our step i wanted to get there before the question between us opened up much further i reflected hungrily that for more than an hour he would have to be silent and i thought with envy of the comparative dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which i might bend my knees
i seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me but i felt that he had got in first when before we had even entered the churchyard he threw out  i want my own sort  it literally made me bound forward
there are not many of your own sort miles i laughed
unless perhaps dear little flora  you really compare me to a baby girl  this found me singularly weak
dont you then love our sweet flora  if i didntand you too if i didnt he repeated as if retreating for a jump yet leaving his thought so unfinished that after we had come into the gate another stop which he imposed on me by the pressure of his arm had become inevitable
mrs grose and flora had passed into the church the other worshippers had followed and we were for the minute alone among the old thick graves
we had paused on the path from the gate by a low oblong tablelike tomb
yes if you didnt  he looked while i waited at the graves
well you know what but he didnt move and he presently produced something that made me drop straight down on the stone slab as if suddenly to rest
does my uncle think what you think  i markedly rested
how do you know what i think  ah well of course i dont for it strikes me you never tell me
but i mean does he know  know what miles  why the way im going on  i perceived quickly enough that i could make to this inquiry no answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer
yet it appeared to me that we were all at bly sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial
i dont think your uncle much cares  miles on this stood looking at me
then dont you think he can be made to  in what way  why by his coming down  but wholl get him to come down  i will the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis
he gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church
xv   the business was practically settled from the moment i never followed him
it was a pitiful surrender to agitation but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me
i only sat there on my tomb and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning by the time i had grasped the whole of which i had also embraced for absence the pretext that i was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay
what i said to myself above all was that miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it for him would be just this awkward collapse
he had got out of me that there was something i was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain for his own purpose more freedom
my fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school for that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind
that his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution that strictly speaking i ought now to have desired to bring on but i could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that i simply procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth
the boy to my deep discomposure was immensely in the right was in a position to say to me either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this interruption of my studies or you cease to expect me to lead with you a life thats so unnatural for a boy what was so unnatural for the particular boy i was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan
that was what really overcame me what prevented my going in
i walked round the church hesitating hovering i reflected that i had already with him hurt myself beyond repair
therefore i could patch up nothing and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for an hour in close silent contact with his commentary on our talk
for the first minute since his arrival i wanted to get away from him
as i paused beneath the high east window and listened to the sounds of worship i was taken with an impulse that might master me i felt completely should i give it the least encouragement
i might easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether
here was my chance there was no one to stop me i could give the whole thing upturn my back and retreat
it was only a question of hurrying again for a few preparations to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied
no one in short could blame me if i should just drive desperately off
what was it to get away if i got away only till dinner
that would be in a couple of hours at the end of whichi had the acute previsionmy little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in their train
what did you do you naughty bad thing
why in the world to worry us soand take our thoughts off too dont you knowdid you desert us at the very door i couldnt meet such questions nor as they asked them their false little lovely eyes yet it was all so exactly what i should have to meet that as the prospect grew sharp to me i at last let myself go
i got so far as the immediate moment was concerned away i came straight out of the churchyard and thinking hard retraced my steps through the park
it seemed to me that by the time i reached the house i had made up my mind i would fly
the sunday stillness both of the approaches and of the interior in which i met no one fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity
were i to get off quickly this way i should get off without a scene without a word
my quickness would have to be remarkable however and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle
tormented in the hall with difficulties and obstacles i remember sinking down at the foot of the staircasesuddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then with a revulsion recalling that it was exactly where more than a month before in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things i had seen the specter of the most horrible of women
at this i was able to straighten myself i went the rest of the way up i made in my bewilderment for the schoolroom where there were objects belonging to me that i should have to take
but i opened the door to find again in a flash my eyes unsealed
in the presence of what i saw i reeled straight back upon my resistance
seated at my own table in clear noonday light i saw a person whom without my previous experience i should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens ink and paper had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart
there was an effort in the way that while her arms rested on the table her hands with evident weariness supported her head but at the moment i took this in i had already become aware that in spite of my entrance her attitude strangely persisted
then it waswith the very act of its announcing itselfthat her identity flared up in a change of posture
she rose not as if she had heard me but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment and within a dozen feet of me stood there as my vile predecessor
dishonored and tragic she was all before me but even as i fixed and for memory secured it the awful image passed away
dark as midnight in her black dress her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe she had looked at me long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers
while these instants lasted indeed i had the extraordinary chill of feeling that it was i who was the intruder
it was as a wild protest against it that actually addressing heryou terrible miserable womani heard myself break into a sound that by the open door rang through the long passage and the empty house
she looked at me as if she heard me but i had recovered myself and cleared the air
there was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that i must stay
xvi   i had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a demonstration that i was freshly upset at having to take into account that they were dumb about my absence
instead of gaily denouncing and caressing me they made no allusion to my having failed them and i was left for the time on perceiving that she too said nothing to study mrs groses odd face
i did this to such purpose that i made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence a silence that however i would engage to break down on the first private opportunity
this opportunity came before tea i secured five minutes with her in the housekeepers room where in the twilight amid a smell of lately baked bread but with the place all swept and garnished i found her sitting in pained placidity before the fire
so i see her still so i see her best facing the flame from her straight chair in the dusky shining room a large clean image of the put awayof drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy
oh yes they asked me to say nothing and to please themso long as they were thereof course i promised
but what had happened to you  i only went with you for the walk i said
i had then to come back to meet a friend  she showed her surprise
a friendyou  oh yes i have a couple i laughed
but did the children give you a reason  for not alluding to your leaving us
yes they said you would like it better
do you like it better  my face had made her rueful
no i like it worse but after an instant i added did they say why i should like it better  no master miles only said we must do nothing but what she likes  i wish indeed he would
and what did flora say  miss flora was too sweet
she said oh of course of courseand i said the same  i thought a moment
you were too sweet tooi can hear you all
but nonetheless between miles and me its now all out  all out my companion stared
but what miss  everything
it doesnt matter
ive made up my mind
i came home my dear i went on for a talk with miss jessel  i had by this time formed the habit of having mrs grose literally well in hand in advance of my sounding that note so that even now as she bravely blinked under the signal of my word i could keep her comparatively firm
a talk
do you mean she spoke  it came to that
i found her on my return in the schoolroom  and what did she say i can hear the good woman still and the candor of her stupefaction
that she suffers the torments  it was this of a truth that made her as she filled out my picture gape
do you mean she faltered of the lost  of the lost
of the damned
and thats why to share them i faltered myself with the horror of it
but my companion with less imagination kept me up
to share them  she wants flora mrs grose might as i gave it to her fairly have fallen away from me had i not been prepared
i still held her there to show i was
as ive told you however it doesnt matter  because youve made up your mind
but to what  to everything  and what do you call everything  why sending for their uncle  oh miss in pity do my friend broke out
ah but i will i will
i see its the only way
whats out as i told you with miles is that if he thinks im afraid toand has ideas of what he gains by thathe shall see hes mistaken
yes yes his uncle shall have it here from me on the spot and before the boy himself if necessary that if im to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school  yes miss my companion pressed me
well theres that awful reason  there were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she was excusable for being vague
butawhich  why the letter from his old place  youll show it to the master  i ought to have done so on the instant  oh no said mrs grose with decision
ill put it before him i went on inexorably that i cant undertake to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled  for weve never in the least known what mrs grose declared
for wickedness
for what elsewhen hes so clever and beautiful and perfect
is he stupid
is he untidy
is he infirm
is he illnatured
hes exquisiteso it can be only that and that would open up the whole thing
after all i said its their uncles fault
if he left here such people  he didnt really in the least know them
the faults mine she had turned quite pale
well you shant suffer i answered
the children shant she emphatically returned
i was silent awhile we looked at each other
then what am i to tell him  you neednt tell him anything
ill tell him  i measured this
do you mean youll write remembering she couldnt i caught myself up
how do you communicate  i tell the bailiff
he writes  and should you like him to write our story  my question had a sarcastic force that i had not fully intended and it made her after a moment inconsequently break down
the tears were again in her eyes
ah miss you write  welltonight i at last answered and on this we separated
xvii   i went so far in the evening as to make a beginning
the weather had changed back a great wind was abroad and beneath the lamp in my room with flora at peace beside me i sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of the gusts
finally i went out taking a candle i crossed the passage and listened a minute at miless door
what under my endless obsession i had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at rest and i presently caught one but not in the form i had expected
his voice tinkled out
i say you therecome in it was a gaiety in the gloom
i went in with my light and found him in bed very wide awake but very much at his ease
well what are you up to he asked with a grace of sociability in which it occurred to me that mrs grose had she been present might have looked in vain for proof that anything was out  i stood over him with my candle
how did you know i was there  why of course i heard you
did you fancy you made no noise
youre like a troop of cavalry he beautifully laughed
then you werent asleep  not much
i lie awake and think  i had put my candle designedly a short way off and then as he held out his friendly old hand to me had sat down on the edge of his bed
what is it i asked that you think of  what in the world my dear but you  ah the pride i take in your appreciation doesnt insist on that
i had so far rather you slept  well i think also you know of this queer business of ours  i marked the coolness of his firm little hand
of what queer business miles  why the way you bring me up
and all the rest  i fairly held my breath a minute and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow
what do you mean by all the rest  oh you know you know  i could say nothing for a minute though i felt as i held his hand and our eyes continued to meet that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation
certainly you shall go back to school i said if it be that that troubles you
but not to the old placewe must find another a better
how could i know it did trouble you this question when you never told me so never spoke of it at all his clear listening face framed in its smooth whiteness made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a childrens hospital and i would have given as the resemblance came to me all i possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him
well even as it was i perhaps might help
do you know youve never said a word to me about your schooli mean the old one never mentioned it in any way  he seemed to wonder he smiled with the same loveliness
but he clearly gained time he waited he called for guidance
havent i it wasnt for me to help himit was for the thing i had met
something in his tone and the expression of his face as i got this from him set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to play under the spell laid on him a part of innocence and consistency
no neverfrom the hour you came back
youve never mentioned to me one of your masters one of your comrades nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school
never little milesno neverhave you given me an inkling of anything that may have happened there
therefore you can fancy how much im in the dark
until you came out that way this morning you had since the first hour i saw you scarce even made a reference to anything in your previous life
you seemed so perfectly to accept the present it was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret precocity or whatever i might call the poison of an influence that i dared but half to phrase made him in spite of the faint breath of his inward trouble appear as accessible as an older personimposed him almost as an intellectual equal
i thought you wanted to go on as you are  it struck me that at this he just faintly colored
he gave at any rate like a convalescent slightly fatigued a languid shake of his head
i donti dont
i want to get away  youre tired of bly  oh no i like bly  well then  oh you know what a boy wants  i felt that i didnt know so well as miles and i took temporary refuge
you want to go to your uncle  again at this with his sweet ironic face he made a movement on the pillow
ah you cant get off with that  i was silent a little and it was i now i think who changed color
my dear i dont want to get off  you cant even if you do
you cant you canthe lay beautifully staring
my uncle must come down and you must completely settle things  if we do i returned with some spirit you may be sure it will be to take you quite away  well dont you understand that thats exactly what im working for
youll have to tell himabout the way youve let it all drop youll have to tell him a tremendous lot  the exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow for the instant to meet him rather more
and how much will you miles have to tell him
there are things hell ask you  he turned it over
very likely
but what things  the things youve never told me
to make up his mind what to do with you
he cant send you back  oh i dont want to go back he broke in
i want a new field  he said it with admirable serenity with positive unimpeachable gaiety and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the poignancy the unnatural childish tragedy of his probable reappearance at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more dishonor
it overwhelmed me now that i should never be able to bear that and it made me let myself go
i threw myself upon him and in the tenderness of my pity i embraced him
dear little miles dear little miles  my face was close to his and he let me kiss him simply taking it with indulgent good humor
well old lady  is there nothingnothing at all that you want to tell me  he turned off a little facing round toward the wall and holding up his hand to look at as one had seen sick children look
ive told youi told you this morning  oh i was sorry for him
that you just want me not to worry you  he looked round at me now as if in recognition of my understanding him then ever so gently to let me alone he replied
there was even a singular little dignity in it something that made me release him yet when i had slowly risen linger beside him
god knows i never wished to harass him but i felt that merely at this to turn my back on him was to abandon or to put it more truly to lose him
ive just begun a letter to your uncle i said
well then finish it  i waited a minute
what happened before  he gazed up at me again
before what  before you came back
and before you went away  for some time he was silent but he continued to meet my eyes
what happened  it made me the sound of the words in which it seemed to me that i caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting consciousnessit made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once more the chance of possessing him
dear little miles dear little miles if you knew how i want to help you
its only that its nothing but that and id rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrongid rather die than hurt a hair of you
dear little milesoh i brought it out now even if i should go too fari just want you to help me to save you but i knew in a moment after this that i had gone too far
the answer to my appeal was instantaneous but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and chill a gust of frozen air and a shake of the room as great as if in the wild wind the casement had crashed in
the boy gave a loud high shriek which lost in the rest of the shock of sound might have seemed indistinctly though i was so close to him a note either of jubilation or of terror
i jumped to my feet again and was conscious of darkness
so for a moment we remained while i stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window tight
why the candles out i then cried
it was i who blew it dear said miles
xviii   the next day after lessons mrs grose found a moment to say to me quietly have you written miss  yesive written but i didnt addfor the hourthat my letter sealed and directed was still in my pocket
there would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the village
meanwhile there had been on the part of my pupils no more brilliant more exemplary morning
it was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction
they performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic soaring quite out of my feeble range and perpetrated in higher spirits than ever geographical and historical jokes
it was conspicuous of course in miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down
this child to my memory really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed never was a small natural creature to the uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom a more ingenious a more extraordinary little gentleman
i had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me to check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which i constantly both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that deserved a penalty
say that by the dark prodigy i knew the imagination of all evil had been opened up to him all the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into an act
he had never at any rate been such a little gentleman as when after our early dinner on this dreadful day he came round to me and asked if i shouldnt like him for half an hour to play to me
david playing to saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion
it was literally a charming exhibition of tact of magnanimity and quite tantamount to his saying outright the true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far
i know what you mean now you mean thatto be let alone yourself and not followed upyoull cease to worry and spy upon me wont keep me so close to you will let me go and come
well i come you seebut i dont go
therell be plenty of time for that
i do really delight in your society and i only want to show you that i contended for a principle it may be imagined whether i resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again hand in hand to the schoolroom
he sat down at the old piano and played as he had never played and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking a football i can only say that i wholly agree with them
for at the end of a time that under his influence i had quite ceased to measure i started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post
it was after luncheon and by the schoolroom fire and yet i hadnt really in the least slept i had only done something much worsei had forgotten
where all this time was flora
when i put the question to miles he played on a minute before answering and then could only say why my dear how do i knowbreaking moreover into a happy laugh which immediately after as if it were a vocal accompaniment he prolonged into incoherent extravagant song
i went straight to my room but his sister was not there then before going downstairs i looked into several others
as she was nowhere about she would surely be with mrs grose whom in the comfort of that theory i accordingly proceeded in quest of
i found her where i had found her the evening before but she met my quick challenge with blank scared ignorance
she had only supposed that after the repast i had carried off both the children as to which she was quite in her right for it was the very first time i had allowed the little girl out of my sight without some special provision
of course now indeed she might be with the maids so that the immediate thing was to look for her without an air of alarm
this we promptly arranged between us but when ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement we met in the hall it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her
for a minute there apart from observation we exchanged mute alarms and i could feel with what high interest my friend returned me all those i had from the first given her
shell be above she presently saidin one of the rooms you havent searched  no shes at a distance i had made up my mind
she has gone out  mrs grose stared
without a hat  i naturally also looked volumes
isnt that woman always without one  shes with her  shes with her i declared
we must find them  my hand was on my friends arm but she failed for the moment confronted with such an account of the matter to respond to my pressure
she communed on the contrary on the spot with her uneasiness
and wheres master miles  oh hes with quint
theyre in the schoolroom  lord miss my view i was myself awareand therefore i suppose my tonehad never yet reached so calm an assurance
the tricks played i went on theyve successfully worked their plan
he found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she went off  divine mrs grose bewilderedly echoed
infernal then i almost cheerfully rejoined
he has provided for himself as well
but come  she had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions
you leave him  so long with quint
yesi dont mind that now  she always ended at these moments by getting possession of my hand and in this manner she could at present still stay me
but after gasping an instant at my sudden resignation because of your letter she eagerly brought out
i quickly by way of answer felt for my letter drew it forth held it up and then freeing myself went and laid it on the great hall table
luke will take it i said as i came back
i reached the house door and opened it i was already on the steps
my companion still demurred the storm of the night and the early morning had dropped but the afternoon was damp and gray
i came down to the drive while she stood in the doorway
you go with nothing on  what do i care when the child has nothing
i cant wait to dress i cried and if you must do so i leave you
try meanwhile yourself upstairs  with them oh on this the poor woman promptly joined me
xix   we went straight to the lake as it was called at bly and i daresay rightly called though i reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes
my acquaintance with sheets of water was small and the pool of bly at all events on the few occasions of my consenting under the protection of my pupils to affront its surface in the old flatbottomed boat moored there for our use had impressed me both with its extent and its agitation
the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house but i had an intimate conviction that wherever flora might be she was not near home
she had not given me the slip for any small adventure and since the day of the very great one that i had shared with her by the pond i had been aware in our walks of the quarter to which she most inclined
this was why i had now given to mrs groses steps so marked a directiona direction that made her when she perceived it oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly mystified
youre going to the water missyou think shes in  she may be though the depth is i believe nowhere very great
but what i judge most likely is that shes on the spot from which the other day we saw together what i told you  when she pretended not to see  with that astounding selfpossession
ive always been sure she wanted to go back alone
and now her brother has managed it for her  mrs grose still stood where she had stopped
you suppose they really talk of them  i could meet this with a confidence
they say things that if we heard them would simply appall us  and if she is there  yes  then miss jessel is  beyond a doubt
you shall see  oh thank you my friend cried planted so firm that taking it in i went straight on without her
by the time i reached the pool however she was close behind me and i knew that whatever to her apprehension might befall me the exposure of my society struck her as her least danger
she exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child
there was no trace of flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling and none on the opposite edge where save for a margin of some twenty yards a thick copse came down to the water
the pond oblong in shape had a width so scant compared to its length that with its ends out of view it might have been taken for a scant river
we looked at the empty expanse and then i felt the suggestion of my friends eyes
i knew what she meant and i replied with a negative headshake
no no wait
she has taken the boat  my companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across the lake
then where is it  our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs
she has used it to go over and then has managed to hide it  all alonethat child  shes not alone and at such times shes not a child shes an old old woman i scanned all the visible shore while mrs grose took again into the queer element i offered her one of her plunges of submission then i pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool an indentation masked for the hither side by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees growing close to the water
but if the boats there where on earths she my colleague anxiously asked
thats exactly what we must learn and i started to walk further
by going all the way round  certainly far as it is
it will take us but ten minutes but its far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk
she went straight over  laws cried my friend again the chain of my logic was ever too much for her
it dragged her at my heels even now and when we had got halfway rounda devious tiresome process on ground much broken and by a path choked with overgrowthi paused to give her breath
i sustained her with a grateful arm assuring her that she might hugely help me and this started us afresh so that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where i had supposed it
it had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came just there down to the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking
i recognized as i looked at the pair of short thick oars quite safely drawn up the prodigious character of the feat for a little girl but i had lived by this time too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures
there was a gate in the fence through which we passed and that brought us after a trifling interval more into the open
then there she is we both exclaimed at once
flora a short way off stood before us on the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete
the next thing she did however was to stoop straight down and pluckquite as if it were all she was there fora big ugly spray of withered fern
i instantly became sure she had just come out of the copse
she waited for us not herself taking a step and i was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently approached her
she smiled and smiled and we met but it was all done in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous
mrs grose was the first to break the spell she threw herself on her knees and drawing the child to her breast clasped in a long embrace the little tender yielding body
while this dumb convulsion lasted i could only watch itwhich i did the more intently when i saw floras face peep at me over our companions shoulder
it was serious nowthe flicker had left it but it strengthened the pang with which i at that moment envied mrs grose the simplicity of her relation
still all this while nothing more passed between us save that flora had let her foolish fern again drop to the ground
what she and i had virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now
when mrs grose finally got up she kept the childs hand so that the two were still before me and the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she launched me
ill be hanged it said if ill speak  it was flora who gazing all over me in candid wonder was the first
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect
why where are your things  where yours are my dear i promptly returned
she had already got back her gaiety and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient
and wheres miles she went on
there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me these three words from her were in a flash like the glitter of a drawn blade the jostle of the cup that my hand for weeks and weeks had held high and full to the brim that now even before speaking i felt overflow in a deluge
ill tell you if youll tell me i heard myself say then heard the tremor in which it broke
well what  mrs groses suspense blazed at me but it was too late now and i brought the thing out handsomely
where my pet is miss jessel     xx   just as in the churchyard with miles the whole thing was upon us
much as i had made of the fact that this name had never once between us been sounded the quick smitten glare with which the childs face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass
it added to the interposing cry as if to stay the blow that mrs grose at the same instant uttered over my violencethe shriek of a creature scared or rather wounded which in turn within a few seconds was completed by a gasp of my own
i seized my colleagues arm
shes there shes there  miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time and i remember strangely as the first feeling now produced in me my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof
she was there and i was justified she was there and i was neither cruel nor mad
she was there for poor scared mrs grose but she was there most for flora and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which i consciously threw out to herwith the sense that pale and ravenous demon as she was she would catch and understand itan inarticulate message of gratitude
she rose erect on the spot my friend and i had lately quitted and there was not in all the long reach of her desire an inch of her evil that fell short
this first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds during which mrs groses dazed blink across to where i pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw just as it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child
the revelation then of the manner in which flora was affected startled me in truth far more than it would have done to find her also merely agitated for direct dismay was of course not what i had expected
prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her she would repress every betrayal and i was therefore shaken on the spot by my first glimpse of the particular one for which i had not allowed
to see her without a convulsion of her small pink face not even feign to glance in the direction of the prodigy i announced but only instead of that turn at me an expression of hard still gravity an expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge methis was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail
i quailed even though my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that instant and in the immediate need to defend myself i called it passionately to witness
shes there you little unhappy thingthere there there and you see her as well as you see me i had said shortly before to mrs grose that she was not at these times a child but an old old woman and that description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which for all answer to this she simply showed me without a concession an admission of her eyes a countenance of deeper and deeper of indeed suddenly quite fixed reprobation
i was by this timeif i can put the whole thing at all togethermore appalled at what i may properly call her manner than at anything else though it was simultaneously with this that i became aware of having mrs grose also and very formidably to reckon with
my elder companion the next moment at any rate blotted out everything but her own flushed face and her loud shocked protest a burst of high disapproval
what a dreadful turn to be sure miss
where on earth do you see anything  i could only grasp her more quickly yet for even while she spoke the hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted
it had already lasted a minute and it lasted while i continued seizing my colleague quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it to insist with my pointing hand
you dont see her exactly as we seeyou mean to say you dont nownow
shes as big as a blazing fire
only look dearest woman look she looked even as i did and gave me with her deep groan of negation repulsion compassionthe mixture with her pity of her relief at her exemptiona sense touching to me even then that she would have backed me up if she could
i might well have needed that for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed i felt my own situation horribly crumble i felti sawmy livid predecessor press from her position on my defeat and i was conscious more than all of what i should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding little attitude of flora
into this attitude mrs grose immediately and violently entered breaking even while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph into breathless reassurance
she isnt there little lady and nobodys thereand you never see nothing my sweet
how can poor miss jesselwhen poor miss jessels dead and buried
we know dont we loveand she appealed blundering in to the child
its all a mere mistake and a worry and a jokeand well go home as fast as we can  our companion on this had responded with a strange quick primness of propriety and they were again with mrs grose on her feet united as it were in pained opposition to me
flora continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation and even at that minute i prayed god to forgive me for seeming to see that as she stood there holding tight to our friends dress her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed had quite vanished
ive said it alreadyshe was literally she was hideously hard she had turned common and almost ugly
i dont know what you mean
i see nobody
i see nothing
i never have
i think youre cruel
i dont like you then after this deliverance which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street she hugged mrs grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful little face
in this position she produced an almost furious wail
take me away take me awayoh take me away from her  from me i panted
from youfrom you she cried
even mrs grose looked across at me dismayed while i had nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that on the opposite bank without a movement as rigidly still as if catching beyond the interval our voices was as vividly there for my disaster as it was not there for my service
the wretched child had spoken exactly as if she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words and i could therefore in the full despair of all i had to accept but sadly shake my head at her
if i had ever doubted all my doubt would at present have gone
ive been living with the miserable truth and now it has only too much closed round me
of course ive lost you ive interfered and youve seenunder her dictationwith which i faced over the pool again our infernal witnessthe easy and perfect way to meet it
ive done my best but ive lost you
goodbye for mrs grose i had an imperative an almost frantic go go before which in infinite distress but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly convinced in spite of her blindness that something awful had occurred and some collapse engulfed us she retreated by the way we had come as fast as she could move
of what first happened when i was left alone i had no subsequent memory
i only knew that at the end of i suppose a quarter of an hour an odorous dampness and roughness chilling and piercing my trouble had made me understand that i must have thrown myself on my face on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief
i must have lain there long and cried and sobbed for when i raised my head the day was almost done
i got up and looked a moment through the twilight at the gray pool and its blank haunted edge and then i took back to the house my dreary and difficult course
when i reached the gate in the fence the boat to my surprise was gone so that i had a fresh reflection to make on floras extraordinary command of the situation
she passed that night by the most tacit and i should add were not the word so grotesque a false note the happiest of arrangements with mrs grose
i saw neither of them on my return but on the other hand as by an ambiguous compensation i saw a great deal of miles
i sawi can use no other phraseso much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been
no evening i had passed at bly had the portentous quality of this one in spite of whichand in spite also of the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my feetthere was literally in the ebbing actual an extraordinarily sweet sadness
on reaching the house i had never so much as looked for the boy i had simply gone straight to my room to change what i was wearing and to take in at a glance much material testimony to floras rupture
her little belongings had all been removed
when later by the schoolroom fire i was served with tea by the usual maid i indulged on the article of my other pupil in no inquiry whatever
he had his freedom nowhe might have it to the end
well he did have it and it consistedin part at leastof his coming in at about eight oclock and sitting down with me in silence
on the removal of the tea things i had blown out the candles and drawn my chair closer i was conscious of a mortal coldness and felt as if i should never again be warm
so when he appeared i was sitting in the glow with my thoughts
he paused a moment by the door as if to look at me thenas if to share themcame to the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair
we sat there in absolute stillness yet he wanted i felt to be with me
xxi   before a new day in my room had fully broken my eyes opened to mrs grose who had come to my bedside with worse news
flora was so markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand she had passed a night of extreme unrest a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not in the least her former but wholly her present governess
it was not against the possible reentrance of miss jessel on the scene that she protestedit was conspicuously and passionately against mine
i was promptly on my feet of course and with an immense deal to ask the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me once more
this i felt as soon as i had put to her the question of her sense of the childs sincerity as against my own
she persists in denying to you that she saw or has ever seen anything  my visitors trouble truly was great
ah miss it isnt a matter on which i can push her
yet it isnt either i must say as if i much needed to
it has made her every inch of her quite old  oh i see her perfectly from here
she resents for all the world like some high little personage the imputation on her truthfulness and as it were her respectability
miss jessel indeedshe ah shes respectable the chit
the impression she gave me there yesterday was i assure you the very strangest of all it was quite beyond any of the others
i did put my foot in it
shell never speak to me again  hideous and obscure as it all was it held mrs grose briefly silent then she granted my point with a frankness which i made sure had more behind it
i think indeed miss she never will
she do have a grand manner about it  and that manneri summed it upis practically whats the matter with her now  oh that manner i could see in my visitors face and not a little else besides
she asks me every three minutes if i think youre coming in  i seei see i too on my side had so much more than worked it out
has she said to you since yesterdayexcept to repudiate her familiarity with anything so dreadfula single other word about miss jessel  not one miss
and of course you know my friend added i took it from her by the lake that just then and there at least there was nobody  rather
and naturally you take it from her still  i dont contradict her
what else can i do  nothing in the world
youve the cleverest little person to deal with
theyve made themtheir two friends i meanstill cleverer even than nature did for it was wondrous material to play on
flora has now her grievance and shell work it to the end  yes miss but to what end  why that of dealing with me to her uncle
shell make me out to him the lowest creature  i winced at the fair show of the scene in mrs groses face she looked for a minute as if she sharply saw them together
and him who thinks so well of you  he has an odd wayit comes over me now i laughedof proving it
but that doesnt matter
what flora wants of course is to get rid of me  my companion bravely concurred
never again to so much as look at you  so that what youve come to me now for i asked is to speed me on my way before she had time to reply however i had her in check
ive a better ideathe result of my reflections
my going would seem the right thing and on sunday i was terribly near it
yet that wont do
its you who must go
you must take flora  my visitor at this did speculate
but where in the world  away from here
away from them
away even most of all now from me
straight to her uncle  only to tell on you  no not only
to leave me in addition with my remedy  she was still vague
and what is your remedy  your loyalty to begin with
and then miless  she looked at me hard
do you think he  wont if he has the chance turn on me
yes i venture still to think it
at all events i want to try
get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me with him alone i was amazed myself at the spirit i had still in reserve and therefore perhaps a trifle the more disconcerted at the way in which in spite of this fine example of it she hesitated
theres one thing of course i went on they mustnt before she goes see each other for three seconds then it came over me that in spite of floras presumable sequestration from the instant of her return from the pool it might already be too late
do you mean i anxiously asked that they have met  at this she quite flushed
ah miss im not such a fool as that
if ive been obliged to leave her three or four times it has been each time with one of the maids and at present though shes alone shes locked in safe
and yetand yet there were too many things
and yet what  well are you so sure of the little gentleman  im not sure of anything but you
but i have since last evening a new hope
i think he wants to give me an opening
i do believe thatpoor little exquisite wretchhe wants to speak
last evening in the firelight and the silence he sat with me for two hours as if it were just coming  mrs grose looked hard through the window at the gray gathering day
and did it come  no though i waited and waited i confess it didnt and it was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sisters condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night
all the same i continued i cant if her uncle sees her consent to his seeing her brother without my having given the boyand most of all because things have got so bada little more time  my friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than i could quite understand
what do you mean by more time  well a day or tworeally to bring it out
hell then be on my sideof which you see the importance
if nothing comes i shall only fail and you will at the worst have helped me by doing on your arrival in town whatever you may have found possible so i put it before her but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed that i came again to her aid
unless indeed i wound up you really want not to go  i could see it in her face at last clear itself she put out her hand to me as a pledge
ill goill go
ill go this morning  i wanted to be very just
if you should wish still to wait i would engage she shouldnt see me  no no its the place itself
she must leave it she held me a moment with heavy eyes then brought out the rest
your ideas the right one
i myself miss  well  i cant stay  the look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities
you mean that since yesterday you have seen  she shook her head with dignity
ive heard  heard  from that childhorrors
there she sighed with tragic relief
on my honor miss she says things but at this evocation she broke down she dropped with a sudden sob upon my sofa and as i had seen her do before gave way to all the grief of it
it was quite in another manner that i for my part let myself go
oh thank god  she sprang up again at this drying her eyes with a groan
thank god  it so justifies me  it does that miss  i couldnt have desired more emphasis but i just hesitated
shes so horrible  i saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it
really shocking  and about me  about you misssince you must have it
its beyond everything for a young lady and i cant think wherever she must have picked up  the appalling language she applied to me
i can then i broke in with a laugh that was doubtless significant enough
it only in truth left my friend still more grave
well perhaps i ought to alsosince ive heard some of it before
yet i cant bear it  the poor woman went on while with the same movement she glanced on my dressing table at the face of my watch
but i must go back  i kept her however
ah if you cant bear it  how can i stop with her you mean
why just for that to get her away
far from this she pursued far from them  she may be different
she may be free i seized her almost with joy
then in spite of yesterday you believe  in such doings her simple description of them required in the light of her expression to be carried no further and she gave me the whole thing as she had never done
i believe  yes it was a joy and we were still shoulder to shoulder if i might continue sure of that i should care but little what else happened
my support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in my early need of confidence and if my friend would answer for my honesty i would answer for all the rest
on the point of taking leave of her nonetheless i was to some extent embarrassed
theres one thing of courseit occurs to meto remember
my letter giving the alarm will have reached town before you  i now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and how weary at last it had made her
your letter wont have got there
your letter never went  what then became of it  goodness knows
master miles  do you mean he took it i gasped
she hung fire but she overcame her reluctance
i mean that i saw yesterday when i came back with miss flora that it wasnt where you had put it
later in the evening i had the chance to question luke and he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it we could only exchange on this one of our deeper mutual soundings and it was mrs grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated you see  yes i see that if miles took it instead he probably will have read it and destroyed it  and dont you see anything else  i faced her a moment with a sad smile
it strikes me that by this time your eyes are open even wider than mine  they proved to be so indeed but she could still blush almost to show it
i make out now what he must have done at school and she gave in her simple sharpness an almost droll disillusioned nod
he stole  i turned it overi tried to be more judicial
wellperhaps  she looked as if she found me unexpectedly calm
he stole letters  she couldnt know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow so i showed them off as i might
i hope then it was to more purpose than in this case
the note at any rate that i put on the table yesterday  i pursued will have given him so scant an advantagefor it contained only the bare demand for an interviewthat he is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little and that what he had on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession i seemed to myself for the instant to have mastered it to see it all
leave us leave usi was already at the door hurrying her off
ill get it out of him
hell meet mehell confess
if he confesses hes saved
and if hes saved  then you are the dear woman kissed me on this and i took her farewell
ill save you without him she cried as she went
xxii   yet it was when she had got offand i missed her on the spotthat the great pinch really came
if i had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with miles i speedily perceived at least that it would give me a measure
no hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing mrs grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates
now i was i said to myself face to face with the elements and for much of the rest of the day while i fought my weakness i could consider that i had been supremely rash
it was a tighter place still than i had yet turned round in all the more that for the first time i could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis
what had happened naturally caused them all to stare there was too little of the explained throw out whatever we might in the suddenness of my colleagues act
the maids and the men looked blank the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until i saw the necessity of making it a positive aid
it was precisely in short by just clutching the helm that i avoided total wreck and i dare say that to bear up at all i became that morning very grand and very dry
i welcomed the consciousness that i was charged with much to do and i caused it to be known as well that left thus to myself i was quite remarkably firm
i wandered with that manner for the next hour or two all over the place and looked i have no doubt as if i were ready for any onset
so for the benefit of whom it might concern i paraded with a sick heart
the person it appeared least to concern proved to be till dinner little miles himself
my perambulations had given me meanwhile no glimpse of him but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano the day before kept me in floras interest so beguiled and befooled
the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom
he had already disappeared when on my way down i pushed open his door and i learned below that he had breakfastedin the presence of a couple of the maidswith mrs grose and his sister
he had then gone out as he said for a stroll than which nothing i reflected could better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office
what he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled there was a queer relief at all eventsi mean for myself in especialin the renouncement of one pretension
if so much had sprung to the surface i scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that i had anything more to teach him
it sufficiently stuck out that by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity i had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity
he had at any rate his freedom now i was never to touch it again as i had amply shown moreover when on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night i had uttered on the subject of the interval just concluded neither challenge nor hint
i had too much from this moment my other ideas
yet when he at last arrived the difficulty of applying them the accumulations of my problem were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet for the eye dropped neither stain nor shadow
to mark for the house the high state i cultivated i decreed that my meals with the boy should be served as we called it downstairs so that i had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of which i had had from mrs grose that first scared sunday my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light
here at present i felt afreshfor i had felt it again and againhow my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will the will to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what i had to deal with was revoltingly against nature
i could only get on at all by taking nature into my confidence and my account by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual of course and unpleasant but demanding after all for a fair front only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue
no attempt nonetheless could well require more tact than just this attempt to supply ones self all the nature
how could i put even a little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had occurred
how on the other hand could i make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure
well a sort of answer after a time had come to me and it was so far confirmed as that i was met incontestably by the quickened vision of what was rare in my little companion
it was indeed as if he had found even nowas he had so often found at lessonsstill some other delicate way to ease me off
wasnt there light in the fact which as we shared our solitude broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite wornthe fact that opportunity aiding precious opportunity which had now come it would be preposterous with a child so endowed to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence
what had his intelligence been given him for but to save him
mightnt one to reach his mind risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character
it was as if when we were face to face in the dining room he had literally shown me the way
the roast mutton was on the table and i had dispensed with attendance
miles before he sat down stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment
but what he presently produced was i say my dear is she really very awfully ill  little flora
not so bad but that shell presently be better
london will set her up
bly had ceased to agree with her
come here and take your mutton  he alertly obeyed me carried the plate carefully to his seat and when he was established went on
did bly disagree with her so terribly suddenly  not so suddenly as you might think
one had seen it coming on  then why didnt you get her off before  before what  before she became too ill to travel  i found myself prompt
shes not too ill to travel she only might have become so if she had stayed
this was just the moment to seize
the journey will dissipate the influenceoh i was grandand carry it off  i see i seemiles for that matter was grand too
he settled to his repast with the charming little table manner that from the day of his arrival had relieved me of all grossness of admonition
whatever he had been driven from school for it was not for ugly feeding
he was irreproachable as always today but he was unmistakably more conscious
he was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found without assistance quite easy and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation
our meal was of the briefestmine a vain pretense and i had the things immediately removed
while this was done miles stood again with his hands in his little pockets and his back to mestood and looked out of the wide window through which that other day i had seen what pulled me up
we continued silent while the maid was with usas silent it whimsically occurred to me as some young couple who on their wedding journey at the inn feel shy in the presence of the waiter
he turned round only when the waiter had left us
wellso were alone     xxiii   oh more or less i fancy my smile was pale
not absolutely
we shouldnt like that i went on
noi suppose we shouldnt
of course we have the others  we have the otherswe have indeed the others i concurred
yet even though we have them he returned still with his hands in his pockets and planted there in front of me they dont much count do they  i made the best of it but i felt wan
it depends on what you call much  yeswith all accommodationeverything depends on this however he faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague restless cogitating step
he remained there awhile with his forehead against the glass in contemplation of the stupid shrubs i knew and the dull things of november
i had always my hypocrisy of work behind which now i gained the sofa
steadying myself with it there as i had repeatedly done at those moments of torment that i have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from which i was barred i sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared for the worst
but an extraordinary impression dropped on me as i extracted a meaning from the boys embarrassed backnone other than the impression that i was not barred now
this inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively he who was
the frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image for him of a kind of failure
i felt that i saw him at any rate shut in or shut out
he was admirable but not comfortable i took it in with a throb of hope
wasnt he looking through the haunted pane for something he couldnt seeand wasnt it the first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse
the first the very first i found it a splendid portent
it made him anxious though he watched himself he had been anxious all day and even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat at table had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss
when he at last turned round to meet me it was almost as if this genius had succumbed
well i think im glad bly agrees with me  you would certainly seem to have seen these twentyfour hours a good deal more of it than for some time before
i hope i went on bravely that youve been enjoying yourself  oh yes ive been ever so far all round aboutmiles and miles away
ive never been so free  he had really a manner of his own and i could only try to keep up with him
well do you like it  he stood there smiling then at last he put into two wordsdo youmore discrimination than i had ever heard two words contain
before i had time to deal with that however he continued as if with the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened
nothing could be more charming than the way you take it for of course if were alone together now its you that are alone most
but i hope he threw in you dont particularly mind  having to do with you i asked
my dear child how can i help minding
though ive renounced all claim to your companyyoure so beyond mei at least greatly enjoy it
what else should i stay on for  he looked at me more directly and the expression of his face graver now struck me as the most beautiful i had ever found in it
you stay on just for that  certainly
i stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest i take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth your while
that neednt surprise you my voice trembled so that i felt it impossible to suppress the shake
dont you remember how i told you when i came and sat on your bed the night of the storm that there was nothing in the world i wouldnt do for you  yes yes he on his side more and more visibly nervous had a tone to master but he was so much more successful than i that laughing out through his gravity he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting
only that i think was to get me to do something for you  it was partly to get you to do something i conceded
but you know you didnt do it  oh yes he said with the brightest superficial eagerness you wanted me to tell you something  thats it
out straight out
what you have on your mind you know  ah then is that what youve stayed over for  he spoke with a gaiety through which i could still catch the finest little quiver of resentful passion but i cant begin to express the effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint
it was as if what i had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me
well yesi may as well make a clean breast of it it was precisely for that  he waited so long that i supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded but what he finally said was do you mean nowhere  there couldnt be a better place or time he looked round him uneasily and i had the rareoh the queerimpression of the very first symptom i had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear
it was as if he were suddenly afraid of mewhich struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him
yet in the very pang of the effort i felt it vain to try sternness and i heard myself the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque
you want so to go out again  awfully he smiled at me heroically and the touching little bravery of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain
he had picked up his hat which he had brought in and stood twirling it in a way that gave me even as i was just nearly reaching port a perverse horror of what i was doing
to do it in any way was an act of violence for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse
wasnt it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness
i suppose i now read into our situation a clearness it couldnt have had at the time for i seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to come
so we circled about with terrors and scruples like fighters not daring to close
but it was for each other we feared
that kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised
ill tell you everything miles saidi mean ill tell you anything you like
youll stay on with me and we shall both be all right and i will tell youi will
but not now  why not now  my insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which between us you might have heard a pin drop
then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom outside someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting
i have to see luke  i had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie and i felt proportionately ashamed
but horrible as it was his lies made up my truth
i achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting
well then go to luke and ill wait for what you promise
only in return for that satisfy before you leave me one very much smaller request  he looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a little to bargain
very much smaller  yes a mere fraction of the whole
tell meoh my work preoccupied me and i was offhandif yesterday afternoon from the table in the hall you took you know my letter     xxiv   my sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something that i can describe only as a fierce split of my attentiona stroke that at first as i sprang straight up reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him drawing him close and while i just fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture instinctively keeping him with his back to the window
the appearance was full upon us that i had already had to deal with here peter quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison
the next thing i saw was that from outside he had reached the window and then i knew that close to the glass and glaring in through it he offered once more to the room his white face of damnation
it represents but grossly what took place within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made yet i believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the act
it came to me in the very horror of the immediate presence that the act would be seeing and facing what i saw and faced to keep the boy himself unaware
the inspirationi can call it by no other namewas that i felt how voluntarily how transcendently i might
it was like fighting with a demon for a human soul and when i had fairly so appraised it i saw how the human soulheld out in the tremor of my hands at arms lengthhad a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead
the face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass and out of it presently came a sound not low nor weak but as if from much further away that i drank like a waft of fragrance
yesi took it  at this with a moan of joy i enfolded i drew him close and while i held him to my breast where i could feel in the sudden fever of his little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart i kept my eyes on the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture
i have likened it to a sentinel but its slow wheel for a moment was rather the prowl of a baffled beast
my present quickened courage however was such that not too much to let it through i had to shade as it were my flame
meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the window the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait
it was the very confidence that i might now defy him as well as the positive certitude by this time of the childs unconsciousness that made me go on
what did you take it for  to see what you said about me  you opened the letter  i opened it  my eyes were now as i held him off a little again on miless own face in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the ravage of uneasiness
what was prodigious was that at last by my success his sense was sealed and his communication stopped he knew that he was in presence but knew not of what and knew still less that i also was and that i did know
and what did this strain of trouble matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air was clear again andby my personal triumphthe influence quenched
there was nothing there
i felt that the cause was mine and that i should surely get all
and you found nothingi let my elation out
he gave the most mournful thoughtful little headshake
nothing  nothing nothing i almost shouted in my joy
nothing nothing he sadly repeated
i kissed his forehead it was drenched
so what have you done with it  ive burned it  burned it it was now or never
is that what you did at school  oh what this brought up
at school  did you take lettersor other things  other things he appeared now to be thinking of something far off and that reached him only through the pressure of his anxiety
yet it did reach him
did i steal  i felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the world
was it for that you mightnt go back  the only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise
did you know i mightnt go back  i know everything  he gave me at this the longest and strangest look
everything  everything
therefore did you but i couldnt say it again
miles could very simply
no
i didnt steal  my face must have shown him i believed him utterly yet my handsbut it was for pure tendernessshook him as if to ask him why if it was all for nothing he had condemned me to months of torment
what then did you do  he looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his breath two or three times over as if with difficulty
he might have been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some faint green twilight
welli said things  only that  they thought it was enough  to turn you out for  never truly had a person turned out shown so little to explain it as this little person
he appeared to weigh my question but in a manner quite detached and almost helpless
well i suppose i oughtnt  but to whom did you say them  he evidently tried to remember but it droppedhe had lost it
i dont know  he almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender which was indeed practically by this time so complete that i ought to have left it there
but i was infatuatedi was blind with victory though even then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was already that of added separation
was it to everyone i asked
no it was only to but he gave a sick little headshake
i dont remember their names  were they then so many  noonly a few
those i liked  those he liked
i seemed to float not into clearness but into a darker obscure and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent
it was for the instant confounding and bottomless for if he were innocent what then on earth was i
paralyzed while it lasted by the mere brush of the question i let him go a little so that with a deepdrawn sigh he turned away from me again which as he faced toward the clear window i suffered feeling that i had nothing now there to keep him from
and did they repeat what you said i went on after a moment
he was soon at some distance from me still breathing hard and again with the air though now without anger for it of being confined against his will
once more as he had done before he looked up at the dim day as if of what had hitherto sustained him nothing was left but an unspeakable anxiety
oh yes he nevertheless repliedthey must have repeated them
to those they liked he added
there was somehow less of it than i had expected but i turned it over
and these things came round  to the masters
oh yes he answered very simply
but i didnt know theyd tell  the masters
they didnttheyve never told
thats why i ask you  he turned to me again his little beautiful fevered face
yes it was too bad  too bad  what i suppose i sometimes said
to write home  i cant name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a speech by such a speaker i only know that the next instant i heard myself throw off with homely force stuff and nonsense but the next after that i must have sounded stern enough
what were these things  my sternness was all for his judge his executioner yet it made him avert himself again and that movement made me with a single bound and an irrepressible cry spring straight upon him
for there again against the glass as if to blight his confession and stay his answer was the hideous author of our woethe white face of damnation
i felt a sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle so that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal
i saw him from the midst of my act meet it with a divination and on the perception that even now he only guessed and that the window was still to his own eyes free i let the impulse flame up to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation
no more no more no more i shrieked as i tried to press him against me to my visitant
is she here miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the direction of my words
then as his strange she staggered me and with a gasp i echoed it miss jessel miss jessel he with a sudden fury gave me back
i seized stupefied his suppositionsome sequel to what we had done to flora but this made me only want to show him that it was better still than that
its not miss jessel
but its at the windowstraight before us
its therethe coward horror there for the last time  at this after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dogs on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light he was at me in a white rage bewildered glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly though it now to my sense filled the room like the taste of poison the wide overwhelming presence
its he  i was so determined to have all my proof that i flashed into ice to challenge him
whom do you mean by he  peter quintyou devil his face gave again round the room its convulsed supplication
where  they are in my ears still his supreme surrender of the name and his tribute to my devotion
what does he matter now my ownwhat will he ever matter
i have you i launched at the beast but he has lost you forever then for the demonstration of my work there there i said to miles
but he had already jerked straight round stared glared again and seen but the quiet day
with the stroke of the loss i was so proud of he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss and the grasp with which i recovered him might have been that of catching him in his fall
i caught him yes i held himit may be imagined with what a passion but at the end of a minute i began to feel what it truly was that i held
we were alone with the quiet day and his little heart dispossessed had stopped
