chapter i   when i was a small boy at the beginning of the century i remember an old man who wore kneebreeches and worsted stockings and who used to hobble about the street of our village with the help of a stick
he must have been getting on for eighty in the year  earlier than which date i suppose i can hardly remember him for i was born in 
a few white locks hung about his ears his shoulders were bent and his knees feeble but he was still hale and was much respected in our little world of paleham
his name was pontifex
his wife was said to be his master i have been told she brought him a little money but it cannot have been much
she was a tall squareshouldered person i have heard my father call her a gothic woman who had insisted on being married to mr pontifex when he was young and too goodnatured to say nay to any woman who wooed him
the pair had lived not unhappily together for mr pontifex's temper was easy and he soon learned to bow before his wife's more stormy moods
mr pontifex was a carpenter by trade he was also at one time parish clerk when i remember him however he had so far risen in life as to be no longer compelled to work with his own hands
in his earlier days he had taught himself to draw
i do not say he drew well but it was surprising he should draw as well as he did
my father who took the living of paleham about the year  became possessed of a good many of old mr pontifex's drawings which were always of local subjects and so unaffectedly painstaking that they might have passed for the work of some good early master
i remember them as hanging up framed and glazed in the study at the rectory and tinted as all else in the room was tinted with the green reflected from the fringe of ivy leaves that grew around the windows
i wonder how they will actually cease and come to an end as drawings and into what new phases of being they will then enter
not content with being an artist mr pontifex must needs also be a musician
he built the organ in the church with his own hands and made a smaller one which he kept in his own house
he could play as much as he could draw not very well according to professional standards but much better than could have been expected
i myself showed a taste for music at an early age and old mr pontifex on finding it out as he soon did became partial to me in consequence
it may be thought that with so many irons in the fire he could hardly be a very thriving man but this was not the case
his father had been a day labourer and he had himself begun life with no other capital than his good sense and good constitution now however there was a goodly show of timber about his yard and a look of solid comfort over his whole establishment
towards the close of the eighteenth century and not long before my father came to paleham he had taken a farm of about ninety acres thus making a considerable rise in life
along with the farm there went an oldfashioned but comfortable house with a charming garden and an orchard
the carpenter's business was now carried on in one of the outhouses that had once been part of some conventual buildings the remains of which could be seen in what was called the abbey close
the house itself embosomed in honeysuckles and creeping roses was an ornament to the whole village nor were its internal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was ornamental
report said that mrs pontifex starched the sheets for her best bed and i can well believe it
how well do i remember her parlour half filled with the organ which her husband had built and scented with a withered apple or two from the pyrus japonica that grew outside the house the picture of the prize ox over the chimneypiece which mr pontifex himself had painted the transparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy night also by mr pontifex the little old man and little old woman who told the weather the china shepherd and shepherdess the jars of feathery flowering grasses with a peacock's feather or two among them to set them off and the china bowls full of dead rose leaves dried with bay salt
all has long since vanished and become a memory faded but still fragrant to myself
nay but her kitchenand the glimpses into a cavernous cellar beyond it wherefrom came gleams from the pale surfaces of milk cans or it may be of the arms and face of a milkmaid skimming the cream or again her storeroom where among other treasures she kept the famous lipsalve which was one of her especial glories and of which she would present a shape yearly to those whom she delighted to honour
she wrote out the recipe for this and gave it to my mother a year or two before she died but we could never make it as she did
when we were children she used sometimes to send her respects to my mother and ask leave for us to come and take tea with her
right well she used to ply us
as for her temper we never met such a delightful old lady in our lives whatever mr pontifex may have had to put up with we had no cause for complaint and then mr pontifex would play to us upon the organ and we would stand round him openmouthed and think him the most wonderfully clever man that ever was born except of course our papa
mrs pontifex had no sense of humour at least i can call to mind no signs of this but her husband had plenty of fun in him though few would have guessed it from his appearance
i remember my father once sent me down to his workship to get some glue and i happened to come when old pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy
he had got the lada puddingheaded fellowby the ear and was saying what
lost againsmothered o' wit
i believe it was the boy who was himself supposed to be a wandering soul and who was thus addressed as lost
now look here my lad he continued some boys are born stupid and thou art one of them some achieve stupiditythat's thee again jimthou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy birthrightand some and here came a climax during which the boy's head and ear were swayed from side to side have stupidity thrust upon them which if it please the lord shall not be thy case my lad for i will thrust stupidity from thee though i have to box thine ears in doing so but i did not see that the old man really did box jim's ears or do more than pretend to frighten him for the two understood one another perfectly well
another time i remember hearing him call the village ratcatcher by saying come hither thou threedaysandthreenights thou alluding as i afterwards learned to the ratcatcher's periods of intoxication but i will tell no more of such trifles
my father's face would always brighten when old pontifex's name was mentioned
i tell you edward he would say to me old pontifex was not only an able man but he was one of the very ablest men that ever i knew
this was more than i as a young man was prepared to stand
my dear father i answered what did he do
he could draw a little but could he to save his life have got a picture into the royal academy exhibition
he built two organs and could play the minuet in samson on one and the march in scipio on the other he was a good carpenter and a bit of a wag he was a good old fellow enough but why make him out so much abler than he was
my boy returned my father you must not judge by the work but by the work in connection with the surroundings
could giotto or filippo lippi think you have got a picture into the exhibition
would a single one of those frescoes we went to see when we were at padua have the remotest chance of being hung if it were sent in for exhibition now
why the academy people would be so outraged that they would not even write to poor giotto to tell him to come and take his fresco away
phew
continued he waxing warm if old pontifex had had cromwell's chances he would have done all that cromwell did and have done it better if he had had giotto's chances he would have done all that giotto did and done it no worse as it was he was a village carpenter and i will undertake to say he never scamped a job in the whole course of his life
but said i we cannot judge people with so many 'ifs'
if old pontifex had lived in giotto's time he might have been another giotto but he did not live in giotto's time
i tell you edward said my father with some severity we must judge men not so much by what they do as by what they make us feel that they have it in them to do
if a man has done enough either in painting music or the affairs of life to make me feel that i might trust him in an emergency he has done enough
it is not by what a man has actually put upon his canvas nor yet by the acts which he has set down so to speak upon the canvas of his life that i will judge him but by what he makes me feel that he felt and aimed at
if he has made me feel that he felt those things to be loveable which i hold loveable myself i ask no more his grammar may have been imperfect but still i have understood him he and i are en rapport and i say again edward that old pontifex was not only an able man but one of the very ablest men i ever knew
against this there was no more to be said and my sisters eyed me to silence
somehow or other my sisters always did eye me to silence when i differed from my father
talk of his successful son snorted my father whom i had fairly roused
he is not fit to black his father's boots
he has his thousands of pounds a year while his father had perhaps three thousand shillings a year towards the end of his life
he is a successful man but his father hobbling about paleham street in his grey worsted stockings broad brimmed hat and brown swallowtailed coat was worth a hundred of george pontifexes for all his carriages and horses and the airs he gives himself
but yet he added george pontifex is no fool either
and this brings us to the second generation of the pontifex family with whom we need concern ourselves
chapter ii   old mr pontifex had married in the year  but for fifteen years his wife bore no children
at the end of that time mrs pontifex astonished the whole village by showing unmistakable signs of a disposition to present her husband with an heir or heiress
hers had long ago been considered a hopeless case and when on consulting the doctor concerning the meaning of certain symptoms she was informed of their significance she became very angry and abused the doctor roundly for talking nonsense
she refused to put so much as a piece of thread into a needle in anticipation of her confinement and would have been absolutely unprepared if her neighbours had not been better judges of her condition than she was and got things ready without telling her anything about it
perhaps she feared nemesis though assuredly she knew not who or what nemesis was perhaps she feared the doctor had made a mistake and she should be laughed at from whatever cause however her refusal to recognise the obvious arose she certainly refused to recognise it until one snowy night in january the doctor was sent for with all urgent speed across the rough country roads
when he arrived he found two patients not one in need of his assistance for a boy had been born who was in due time christened george in honour of his then reigning majesty
to the best of my belief george pontifex got the greater part of his nature from this obstinate old lady his mothera mother who though she loved no one else in the world except her husband and him only after a fashion was most tenderly attached to the unexpected child of her old age nevertheless she showed it little
the boy grew up into a sturdy brighteyed little fellow with plenty of intelligence and perhaps a trifle too great readiness at book learning
being kindly treated at home he was as fond of his father and mother as it was in his nature to be of anyone but he was fond of no one else
he had a good healthy sense of meum and as little of tuum as he could help
brought up much in the open air in one of the best situated and healthiest villages in england his little limbs had fair play and in those days children's brains were not overtasked as they now are perhaps it was for this very reason that the boy showed an avidity to learn
at seven or eight years old he could read write and sum better than any other boy of his age in the village
my father was not yet rector of paleham and did not remember george pontifex's childhood but i have heard neighbours tell him that the boy was looked upon as unusually quick and forward
his father and mother were naturally proud of their offspring and his mother was determined that he should one day become one of the kings and councillors of the earth
it is one thing however to resolve that one's son shall win some of life's larger prizes and another to square matters with fortune in this respect
george pontifex might have been brought up as a carpenter and succeeded in no other way than as succeeding his father as one of the minor magnates of paleham and yet have been a more truly successful man than he actually wasfor i take it there is not much more solid success in this world than what fell to the lot of old mr and mrs pontifex it happened however that about the year  when george was a boy of fifteen a sister of mrs pontifex's who had married a mr fairlie came to pay a few days' visit at paleham
mr fairlie was a publisher chiefly of religious works and had an establishment in paternoster row he had risen in life and his wife had risen with him
no very close relations had been maintained between the sisters for some years and i forget exactly how it came about that mr and mrs fairlie were guests in the quiet but exceedingly comfortable house of their sister and brotherin law but for some reason or other the visit was paid and little george soon succeeded in making his way into his uncle and aunt's good graces
a quick intelligent boy with a good address a sound constitution and coming of respectable parents has a potential value which a practised business man who has need of many subordinates is little likely to overlook
before his visit was over mr fairlie proposed to the lad's father and mother that he should put him into his own business at the same time promising that if the boy did well he should not want some one to bring him forward
mrs pontifex had her son's interest too much at heart to refuse such an offer so the matter was soon arranged and about a fortnight after the fairlies had left george was sent up by coach to london where he was met by his uncle and aunt with whom it was arranged that he should live
this was george's great start in life
he now wore more fashionable clothes than he had yet been accustomed to and any little rusticity of gait or pronunciation which he had brought from paleham was so quickly and completely lost that it was ere long impossible to detect that he had not been born and bred among people of what is commonly called education
the boy paid great attention to his work and more than justified the favourable opinion which mr fairlie had formed concerning him
sometimes mr fairlie would send him down to paleham for a few days' holiday and ere long his parents perceived that he had acquired an air and manner of talking different from any that he had taken with him from paleham
they were proud of him and soon fell into their proper places resigning all appearance of a parental control for which indeed there was no kind of necessity
in return george was always kindly to them and to the end of his life retained a more affectionate feeling towards his father and mother than i imagine him ever to have felt again for man woman or child
george's visits to paleham were never long for the distance from london was under fifty miles and there was a direct coach so that the journey was easy there was not time therefore for the novelty to wear off either on the part of the young man or of his parents
george liked the fresh country air and green fields after the darkness to which he had been so long accustomed in paternoster row which then as now was a narrow gloomy lane rather than a street
independently of the pleasure of seeing the familiar faces of the farmers and villagers he liked also being seen and being congratulated on growing up such a finelooking and fortunate young fellow for he was not the youth to hide his light under a bushel
his uncle had had him taught latin and greek of an evening he had taken kindly to these languages and had rapidly and easily mastered what many boys take years in acquiring
i suppose his knowledge gave him a selfconfidence which made itself felt whether he intended it or not at any rate he soon began to pose as a judge of literature and from this to being a judge of art architecture music and everything else the path was easy
like his father he knew the value of money but he was at once more ostentatious and less liberal than his father while yet a boy he was a thorough little man of the world and did well rather upon principles which he had tested by personal experiment and recognised as principles than from those profounder convictions which in his father were so instinctive that he could give no account concerning them
his father as i have said wondered at him and let him alone
his son had fairly distanced him and in an inarticulate way the father knew it perfectly well
after a few years he took to wearing his best clothes whenever his son came to stay with him nor would he discard them for his ordinary ones till the young man had returned to london
i believe old mr pontifex along with his pride and affection felt also a certain fear of his son as though of something which he could not thoroughly understand and whose ways notwithstanding outward agreement were nevertheless not as his ways
mrs pontifex felt nothing of this to her george was pure and absolute perfection and she saw or thought she saw with pleasure that he resembled her and her family in feature as well as in disposition rather than her husband and his
when george was about twentyfive years old his uncle took him into partnership on very liberal terms
he had little cause to regret this step
the young man infused fresh vigour into a concern that was already vigorous and by the time he was thirty found himself in the receipt of not less than  pounds a year as his share of the profits
two years later he married a lady about seven years younger than himself who brought him a handsome dowry
she died in  when her youngest child alethea was born and her husband did not marry again
chapter iii   in the early years of the century five little children and a couple of nurses began to make periodical visits to paleham
it is needless to say they were a rising generation of pontifexes towards whom the old couple their grandparents were as tenderly deferential as they would have been to the children of the lord lieutenant of the county
their names were eliza maria john theobald who like myself was born in  and alethea
mr pontifex always put the prefix master or miss before the names of his grandchildren except in the case of alethea who was his favourite
to have resisted his grandchildren would have been as impossible for him as to have resisted his wife even old mrs pontifex yielded before her son's children and gave them all manner of licence which she would never have allowed even to my sisters and myself who stood next in her regard
two regulations only they must attend to they must wipe their shoes well on coming into the house and they must not overfeed mr pontifex's organ with wind nor take the pipes out
by us at the rectory there was no time so much looked forward to as the annual visit of the little pontifexes to paleham
we came in for some of the prevailing licence we went to tea with mrs pontifex to meet her grandchildren and then our young friends were asked to the rectory to have tea with us and we had what we considered great times
i fell desperately in love with alethea indeed we all fell in love with each other plurality and exchange whether of wives or husbands being openly and unblushingly advocated in the very presence of our nurses
we were very merry but it is so long ago that i have forgotten nearly everything save that we were very merry
almost the only thing that remains with me as a permanent impression was the fact that theobald one day beat his nurse and teased her and when she said she should go away cried out you shan't go awayi'll keep you on purpose to torment you
one winter's morning however in the year  we heard the church bell tolling while we were dressing in the back nursery and were told it was for old mrs pontifex
our manservant john told us and added with grim levity that they were ringing the bell to come and take her away
she had had a fit of paralysis which had carried her off quite suddenly
it was very shocking the more so because our nurse assured us that if god chose we might all have fits of paralysis ourselves that very day and be taken straight off to the day of judgement
the day of judgement indeed according to the opinion of those who were most likely to know would not under any circumstances be delayed more than a few years longer and then the whole world would be burned and we ourselves be consigned to an eternity of torture unless we mended our ways more than we at present seemed at all likely to do
all this was so alarming that we fell to screaming and made such a hullabaloo that the nurse was obliged for her own peace to reassure us
then we wept but more composedly as we remembered that there would be no more tea and cakes for us now at old mrs pontifex's
on the day of the funeral however we had a great excitement old mr pontifex sent round a penny loaf to every inhabitant of the village according to a custom still not uncommon at the beginning of the century the loaf was called a dole
we had never heard of this custom before besides though we had often heard of penny loaves we had never before seen one moreover they were presents to us as inhabitants of the village and we were treated as grown up people for our father and mother and the servants had each one loaf sent them but only one
we had never yet suspected that we were inhabitants at all finally the little loaves were new and we were passionately fond of new bread which we were seldom or never allowed to have as it was supposed not to be good for us
our affection therefore for our old friend had to stand against the combined attacks of archaeological interest the rights of citizenship and property the pleasantness to the eye and goodness for food of the little loaves themselves and the sense of importance which was given us by our having been intimate with someone who had actually died
it seemed upon further inquiry that there was little reason to anticipate an early death for anyone of ourselves and this being so we rather liked the idea of someone else's being put away into the churchyard we passed therefore in a short time from extreme depression to a no less extreme exultation a new heaven and a new earth had been revealed to us in our perception of the possibility of benefiting by the death of our friends and i fear that for some time we took an interest in the health of everyone in the village whose position rendered a repetition of the dole in the least likely
those were the days in which all great things seemed far off and we were astonished to find that napoleon buonaparte was an actually living person
we had thought such a great man could only have lived a very long time ago and here he was after all almost as it were at our own doors
this lent colour to the view that the day of judgement might indeed be nearer than we had thought but nurse said that was all right now and she knew
in those days the snow lay longer and drifted deeper in the lanes than it does now and the milk was sometimes brought in frozen in winter and we were taken down into the back kitchen to see it
i suppose there are rectories up and down the country now where the milk comes in frozen sometimes in winter and the children go down to wonder at it but i never see any frozen milk in london so i suppose the winters are warmer than they used to be
about one year after his wife's death mr pontifex also was gathered to his fathers
my father saw him the day before he died
the old man had a theory about sunsets and had had two steps built up against a wall in the kitchen garden on which he used to stand and watch the sun go down whenever it was clear
my father came on him in the afternoon just as the sun was setting and saw him with his arms resting on the top of the wall looking towards the sun over a field through which there was a path on which my father was
my father heard him say goodbye sun good bye sun as the sun sank and saw by his tone and manner that he was feeling very feeble
before the next sunset he was gone
there was no dole
some of his grandchildren were brought to the funeral and we remonstrated with them but did not take much by doing so
john pontifex who was a year older than i was sneered at penny loaves and intimated that if i wanted one it must be because my papa and mamma could not afford to buy me one whereon i believe we did something like fighting and i rather think john pontifex got the worst of it but it may have been the other way
i remember my sister's nurse for i was just outgrowing nurses myself reported the matter to higher quarters and we were all of us put to some ignominy but we had been thoroughly awakened from our dream and it was long enough before we could hear the words penny loaf mentioned without our ears tingling with shame
if there had been a dozen doles afterwards we should not have deigned to touch one of them
george pontifex put up a monument to his parents a plain slab in paleham church inscribed with the following epitaph  sacred to the memory  of  john pontifex  who was born august th   and died february    in his th year  and of  ruth pontifex his wife  who was born october   and died january    in her th year
they were unostentatious but exemplary  in the discharge of their  religious moral and social duties
this monument was placed  by their only son
chapter iv   in a year or two more came waterloo and the european peace
then mr george pontifex went abroad more than once
i remember seeing at battersby in after years the diary which he kept on the first of these occasions
it is a characteristic document
i felt as i read it that the author before starting had made up his mind to admire only what he thought it would be creditable in him to admire to look at nature and art only through the spectacles that had been handed down to him by generation after generation of prigs and impostors
the first glimpse of mont blanc threw mr pontifex into a conventional ecstasy
my feelings i cannot express
i gasped yet hardly dared to breathe as i viewed for the first time the monarch of the mountains
i seemed to fancy the genius seated on his stupendous throne far above his aspiring brethren and in his solitary might defying the universe
i was so overcome by my feelings that i was almost bereft of my faculties and would not for worlds have spoken after my first exclamation till i found some relief in a gush of tears
with pain i tore myself from contemplating for the first time 'at distance dimly seen' though i felt as if i had sent my soul and eyes after it this sublime spectacle
after a nearer view of the alps from above geneva he walked nine out of the twelve miles of the descent my mind and heart were too full to sit still and i found some relief by exhausting my feelings through exercise
in the course of time he reached chamonix and went on a sunday to the montanvert to see the mer de glace
there he wrote the following verses for the visitors' book which he considered so he says suitable to the day and scene     lord while these wonders of thy hand i see    my soul in holy reverence bends to thee
these awful solitudes this dread repose    yon pyramid sublime of spotless snows    these spiry pinnacles those smiling plains    this sea where one eternal winter reigns    these are thy works and while on them i gaze    i hear a silent tongue that speaks thy praise
some poets always begin to get groggy about the knees after running for seven or eight lines
mr pontifex's last couplet gave him a lot of trouble and nearly every word has been erased and rewritten once at least
in the visitors' book at the montanvert however he must have been obliged to commit himself definitely to one reading or another
taking the verses all round i should say that mr pontifex was right in considering them suitable to the day i don't like being too hard even on the mer de glace so will give no opinion as to whether they are suitable to the scene also
mr pontifex went on to the great st bernard and there he wrote some more verses this time i am afraid in latin
he also took good care to be properly impressed by the hospice and its situation
the whole of this most extraordinary journey seemed like a dream its conclusion especially in gentlemanly society with every comfort and accommodation amidst the rudest rocks and in the region of perpetual snow
the thought that i was sleeping in a convent and occupied the bed of no less a person than napoleon that i was in the highest inhabited spot in the old world and in a place celebrated in every part of it kept me awake some time
as a contrast to this i may quote here an extract from a letter written to me last year by his grandson ernest of whom the reader will hear more presently
the passage runs i went up to the great st bernard and saw the dogs
in due course mr pontifex found his way into italy where the pictures and other works of artthose at least which were fashionable at that timethrew him into genteel paroxysms of admiration
of the uffizi gallery at florence he writes i have spent three hours this morning in the gallery and i have made up my mind that if of all the treasures i have seen in italy i were to choose one room it would be the tribune of this gallery
it contains the venus de' medici the explorator the pancratist the dancing faun and a fine apollo
these more than outweigh the laocoon and the belvedere apollo at rome
it contains besides the st john of raphael and many other chefsd'oeuvre of the greatest masters in the world
it is interesting to compare mr pontifex's effusions with the rhapsodies of critics in our own times
not long ago a much esteemed writer informed the world that he felt disposed to cry out with delight before a figure by michael angelo
i wonder whether he would feel disposed to cry out before a real michael angelo if the critics had decided that it was not genuine or before a reputed michael angelo which was really by someone else
but i suppose that a prig with more money than brains was much the same sixty or seventy years ago as he is now
look at mendelssohn again about this same tribune on which mr pontifex felt so safe in staking his reputation as a man of taste and culture
he feels no less safe and writes i then went to the tribune
this room is so delightfully small you can traverse it in fifteen paces yet it contains a world of art
i again sought out my favourite arm chair which stands under the statue of the 'slave whetting his knife' l'arrotino and taking possession of it i enjoyed myself for a couple of hours for here at one glance i had the 'madonna del cardellino' pope julius ii a female portrait by raphael and above it a lovely holy family by perugino and so close to me that i could have touched it with my hand the venus de' medici beyond that of titian 
 
the space between is occupied by other pictures of raphael's a portrait by titian a domenichino etc etc all these within the circumference of a small semicircle no larger than one of your own rooms
this is a spot where a man feels his own insignificance and may well learn to be humble
the tribune is a slippery place for people like mendelssohn to study humility in
they generally take two steps away from it for one they take towards it
i wonder how many chalks mendelssohn gave himself for having sat two hours on that chair
i wonder how often he looked at his watch to see if his two hours were up
i wonder how often he told himself that he was quite as big a gun if the truth were known as any of the men whose works he saw before him how often he wondered whether any of the visitors were recognizing him and admiring him for sitting such a long time in the same chair and how often he was vexed at seeing them pass him by and take no notice of him
but perhaps if the truth were known his two hours was not quite two hours
returning to mr pontifex whether he liked what he believed to be the masterpieces of greek and italian art or no he brought back some copies by italian artists which i have no doubt he satisfied himself would bear the strictest examination with the originals
two of these copies fell to theobald's share on the division of his father's furniture and i have often seen them at battersby on my visits to theobald and his wife
the one was a madonna by sassoferrato with a blue hood over her head which threw it half into shadow
the other was a magdalen by carlo dolci with a very fine head of hair and a marble vase in her hands
when i was a young man i used to think these pictures were beautiful but with each successive visit to battersby i got to dislike them more and more and to see george pontifex written all over both of them
in the end i ventured after a tentative fashion to blow on them a little but theobald and his wife were up in arms at once
they did not like their father and fatherinlaw but there could be no question about his power and general ability nor about his having been a man of consummate taste both in literature and artindeed the diary he kept during his foreign tour was enough to prove this
with one more short extract i will leave this diary and proceed with my story
during his stay in florence mr pontifex wrote i have just seen the grand duke and his family pass by in two carriages and six but little more notice is taken of them than if i who am utterly unknown here were to pass by
i don't think that he half believed in his being utterly unknown in florence or anywhere else
chapter v   fortune we are told is a blind and fickle fostermother who showers her gifts at random upon her nurslings
but we do her a grave injustice if we believe such an accusation
trace a man's career from his cradle to his grave and mark how fortune has treated him
you will find that when he is once dead she can for the most part be vindicated from the charge of any but very superficial fickleness
her blindness is the merest fable she can espy her favourites long before they are born
we are as days and have had our parents for our yesterdays but through all the fair weather of a clear parental sky the eye of fortune can discern the coming storm and she laughs as she places her favourites it may be in a london alley or those whom she is resolved to ruin in kings' palaces
seldom does she relent towards those whom she has suckled unkindly and seldom does she completely fail a favoured nursling
was george pontifex one of fortune's favoured nurslings or not
on the whole i should say that he was not for he did not consider himself so he was too religious to consider fortune a deity at all he took whatever she gave and never thanked her being firmly convinced that whatever he got to his own advantage was of his own getting
and so it was after fortune had made him able to get it
nos te nos facimus fortuna deam exclaimed the poet
it is we who make thee fortune a goddess and so it is after fortune has made us able to make her
the poet says nothing as to the making of the nos
perhaps some men are independent of antecedents and surroundings and have an initial force within themselves which is in no way due to causation but this is supposed to be a difficult question and it may be as well to avoid it
let it suffice that george pontifex did not consider himself fortunate and he who does not consider himself fortunate is unfortunate
true he was rich universally respected and of an excellent natural constitution
if he had eaten and drunk less he would never have known a day's indisposition
perhaps his main strength lay in the fact that though his capacity was a little above the average it was not too much so
it is on this rock that so many clever people split
the successful man will see just so much more than his neighbours as they will be able to see too when it is shown them but not enough to puzzle them
it is far safer to know too little than too much
people will condemn the one though they will resent being called upon to exert themselves to follow the other
the best example of mr pontifex's good sense in matters connected with his business which i can think of at this moment is the revolution which he effected in the style of advertising works published by the firm
when he first became a partner one of the firm's advertisements ran thus     books proper to be given away at this season     the pious country parishioner being directions how a christian may    manage every day in the course of his whole life with safety and    success how to spend the sabbath day what books of the holy    scripture ought to be read first the whole method of education    collects for the most important virtues that adorn the soul a    discourse on the lord's supper rules to set the soul right in    sickness so that in this treatise are contained all the rules    requisite for salvation
the th edition with additions
price d
 an allowance will be made to those who give them away
before he had been many years a partner the advertisement stood as follows     the pious country parishioner
a complete manual of christian    devotion
price d
a reduction will be made to purchasers for gratuitous distribution
what a stride is made in the foregoing towards the modern standard and what intelligence is involved in the perception of the unseemliness of the old style when others did not perceive it
where then was the weak place in george pontifex's armour
i suppose in the fact that he had risen too rapidly
it would almost seem as if a transmitted education of some generations is necessary for the due enjoyment of great wealth
adversity if a man is set down to it by degrees is more supportable with equanimity by most people than any great prosperity arrived at in a single lifetime
nevertheless a certain kind of good fortune generally attends selfmade men to the last
it is their children of the first or first and second generation who are in greater danger for the race can no more repeat its most successful performances suddenly and without its ebbings and flowings of success than the individual can do so and the more brilliant the success in any one generation the greater as a general rule the subsequent exhaustion until time has been allowed for recovery
hence it oftens happens that the grandson of a successful man will be more successful than the sonthe spirit that actuated the grandfather having lain fallow in the son and being refreshed by repose so as to be ready for fresh exertion in the grandson
a very successful man moreover has something of the hybrid in him he is a new animal arising from the coming together of many unfamiliar elements and it is well known that the reproduction of abnormal growths whether animal or vegetable is irregular and not to be depended upon even when they are not absolutely sterile
and certainly mr pontifex's success was exceedingly rapid
only a few years after he had become a partner his uncle and aunt both died within a few months of one another
it was then found that they had made him their heir
he was thus not only sole partner in the business but found himself with a fortune of some  pounds into the bargain and this was a large sum in those days
money came pouring in upon him and the faster it came the fonder he became of it though as he frequently said he valued it not for its own sake but only as a means of providing for his dear children
yet when a man is very fond of his money it is not easy for him at all times to be very fond of his children also
the two are like god and mammon
lord macaulay has a passage in which he contrasts the pleasures which a man may derive from books with the inconveniences to which he may be put by his acquaintances
plato he says is never sullen
cervantes is never petulant
demosthenes never comes unseasonably
dante never stays too long
no difference of political opinion can alienate cicero
no heresy can excite the horror of bossuet
i dare say i might differ from lord macaulay in my estimate of some of the writers he has named but there can be no disputing his main proposition namely that we need have no more trouble from any of them than we have a mind to whereas our friends are not always so easily disposed of
george pontifex felt this as regards his children and his money
his money was never naughty his money never made noise or litter and did not spill things on the tablecloth at meal times or leave the door open when it went out
his dividends did not quarrel among themselves nor was he under any uneasiness lest his mortgages should become extravagant on reaching manhood and run him up debts which sooner or later he should have to pay
there were tendencies in john which made him very uneasy and theobald his second son was idle and at times far from truthful
his children might perhaps have answered had they known what was in their father's mind that he did not knock his money about as he not infrequently knocked his children
he never dealt hastily or pettishly with his money and that was perhaps why he and it got on so well together
it must be remembered that at the beginning of the nineteenth century the relations between parents and children were still far from satisfactory
the violent type of father as described by fielding richardson smollett and sheridan is now hardly more likely to find a place in literature than the original advertisement of messrs fairlie  pontifex's pious country parishioner but the type was much too persistent not to have been drawn from nature closely
the parents in miss austen's novels are less like savage wild beasts than those of her predecessors but she evidently looks upon them with suspicion and an uneasy feeling that le pere de famille est capable de tout makes itself sufficiently apparent throughout the greater part of her writings
in the elizabethan time the relations between parents and children seem on the whole to have been more kindly
the fathers and the sons are for the most part friends in shakespeare nor does the evil appear to have reached its full abomination till a long course of puritanism had familiarised men's minds with jewish ideals as those which we should endeavour to reproduce in our everyday life
what precedents did not abraham jephthah and jonadab the son of rechab offer
how easy was it to quote and follow them in an age when few reasonable men or women doubted that every syllable of the old testament was taken down verbatim from the mouth of god
moreover puritanism restricted natural pleasures it substituted the jeremiad for the paean and it forgot that the poor abuses of all times want countenance
mr pontifex may have been a little sterner with his children than some of his neighbours but not much
he thrashed his boys two or three times a week and some weeks a good deal oftener but in those days fathers were always thrashing their boys
it is easy to have juster views when everyone else has them but fortunately or unfortunately results have nothing whatever to do with the moral guilt or blamelessness of him who brings them about they depend solely upon the thing done whatever it may happen to be
the moral guilt or blamelessness in like manner has nothing to do with the result it turns upon the question whether a sufficient number of reasonable people placed as the actor was placed would have done as the actor has done
at that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil the child and st paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly company
if his children did anything which mr pontifex disliked they were clearly disobedient to their father
in this case there was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take
it consisted in checking the first signs of self will while his children were too young to offer serious resistance
if their wills were well broken in childhood to use an expression then much in vogue they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break through till they were over twentyone years old
then they might please themselves he should know how to protect himself till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked
how little do we know our thoughtsour reflex actions indeed yes but our reflex reflections
man forsooth prides himself on his consciousness
we boast that we differ from the winds and waves and falling stones and plants which grow they know not why and from the wandering creatures which go up and down after their prey as we are pleased to say without the help of reason
we know so well what we are doing ourselves and why we do it do we not
i fancy that there is some truth in the view which is being put forward nowadays that it is our less conscious thoughts and our less conscious actions which mainly mould our lives and the lives of those who spring from us
chapter vi   mr pontifex was not the man to trouble himself much about his motives
people were not so introspective then as we are now they lived more according to a rule of thumb
dr arnold had not yet sown that crop of earnest thinkers which we are now harvesting and men did not see why they should not have their own way if no evil consequences to themselves seemed likely to follow upon their doing so
then as now however they sometimes let themselves in for more evil consequences than they had bargained for
like other rich men at the beginning of this century he ate and drank a good deal more than was enough to keep him in health
even his excellent constitution was not proof against a prolonged course of overfeeding and what we should now consider overdrinking
his liver would not unfrequently get out of order and he would come down to breakfast looking yellow about the eyes
then the young people knew that they had better look out
it is not as a general rule the eating of sour grapes that causes the children's teeth to be set on edge
welltodo parents seldom eat many sour grapes the danger to the children lies in the parents eating too many sweet ones
i grant that at first sight it seems very unjust that the parents should have the fun and the children be punished for it but young people should remember that for many years they were part and parcel of their parents and therefore had a good deal of the fun in the person of their parents
if they have forgotten the fun now that is no more than people do who have a headache after having been tipsy overnight
the man with a headache does not pretend to be a different person from the man who got drunk and claim that it is his self of the preceding night and not his self of this morning who should be punished no more should offspring complain of the headache which it has earned when in the person of its parents for the continuation of identity though not so immediately apparent is just as real in one case as in the other
what is really hard is when the parents have the fun after the children have been born and the children are punished for this
on these his black days he would take very gloomy views of things and say to himself that in spite of all his goodness to them his children did not love him
but who can love any man whose liver is out of order
how base he would exclaim to himself was such ingratitude
how especially hard upon himself who had been such a model son and always honoured and obeyed his parents though they had not spent one hundredth part of the money upon him which he had lavished upon his own children
it is always the same story he would say to himself the more young people have the more they want and the less thanks one gets i have made a great mistake i have been far too lenient with my children never mind i have done my duty by them and more if they fail in theirs to me it is a matter between god and them
i at any rate am guiltless
why i might have married again and become the father of a second and perhaps more affectionate family etc etc
he pitied himself for the expensive education which he was giving his children he did not see that the education cost the children far more than it cost him inasmuch as it cost them the power of earning their living easily rather than helped them towards it and ensured their being at the mercy of their father for years after they had come to an age when they should be independent
a public school education cuts off a boy's retreat he can no longer become a labourer or a mechanic and these are the only people whose tenure of independence is not precariouswith the exception of course of those who are born inheritors of money or who are placed young in some safe and deep groove
mr pontifex saw nothing of this all he saw was that he was spending much more money upon his children than the law would have compelled him to do and what more could you have
might he not have apprenticed both his sons to greengrocers
might he not even yet do so tomorrow morning if he were so minded
the possibility of this course being adopted was a favourite topic with him when he was out of temper true he never did apprentice either of his sons to greengrocers but his boys comparing notes together had sometimes come to the conclusion that they wished he would
at other times when not quite well he would have them in for the fun of shaking his will at them
he would in his imagination cut them all out one after another and leave his money to found almshouses till at last he was obliged to put them back so that he might have the pleasure of cutting them out again the next time he was in a passion
of course if young people allow their conduct to be in any way influenced by regard to the wills of living persons they are doing very wrong and must expect to be sufferers in the end nevertheless the powers of will dangling and willshaking are so liable to abuse and are continually made so great an engine of torture that i would pass a law if i could to incapacitate any man from making a will for three months from the date of each offence in either of the above respects and let the bench of magistrates or judge before whom he has been convicted dispose of his property as they shall think right and reasonable if he dies during the time that his willmaking power is suspended
mr pontifex would have the boys into the diningroom
my dear john my dear theobald he would say look at me
i began life with nothing but the clothes with which my father and mother sent me up to london
my father gave me ten shillings and my mother five for pocket money and i thought them munificent
i never asked my father for a shilling in the whole course of my life nor took aught from him beyond the small sum he used to allow me monthly till i was in receipt of a salary
i made my own way and i shall expect my sons to do the same
pray don't take it into your heads that i am going to wear my life out making money that my sons may spend it for me
if you want money you must make it for yourselves as i did for i give you my word i will not leave a penny to either of you unless you show that you deserve it
young people seem nowadays to expect all kinds of luxuries and indulgences which were never heard of when i was a boy
why my father was a common carpenter and here you are both of you at public schools costing me ever so many hundreds a year while i at your age was plodding away behind a desk in my uncle fairlie's counting house
what should i not have done if i had had one half of your advantages
you should become dukes or found new empires in undiscovered countries and even then i doubt whether you would have done proportionately so much as i have done
no no i shall see you through school and college and then if you please you will make your own way in the world
in this manner he would work himself up into such a state of virtuous indignation that he would sometimes thrash the boys then and there upon some pretext invented at the moment
and yet as children went the young pontifexes were fortunate there would be ten families of young people worse off for one better they ate and drank good wholesome food slept in comfortable beds had the best doctors to attend them when they were ill and the best education that could be had for money
the want of fresh air does not seem much to affect the happiness of children in a london alley the greater part of them sing and play as though they were on a moor in scotland
so the absence of a genial mental atmosphere is not commonly recognised by children who have never known it
young people have a marvellous faculty of either dying or adapting themselves to circumstances
even if they are unhappyvery unhappyit is astonishing how easily they can be prevented from finding it out or at any rate from attributing it to any other cause than their own sinfulness
to parents who wish to lead a quiet life i would say tell your children that they are very naughtymuch naughtier than most children
point to the young people of some acquaintances as models of perfection and impress your own children with a deep sense of their own inferiority
you carry so many more guns than they do that they cannot fight you
this is called moral influence and it will enable you to bounce them as much as you please
they think you know and they will not have yet caught you lying often enough to suspect that you are not the unworldly and scrupulously truthful person which you represent yourself to be nor yet will they know how great a coward you are nor how soon you will run away if they fight you with persistency and judgement
you keep the dice and throw them both for your children and yourself
load them then for you can easily manage to stop your children from examining them
tell them how singularly indulgent you are insist on the incalculable benefit you conferred upon them firstly in bringing them into the world at all but more particularly in bringing them into it as your own children rather than anyone else's
say that you have their highest interests at stake whenever you are out of temper and wish to make yourself unpleasant by way of balm to your soul
harp much upon these highest interests
feed them spiritually upon such brimstone and treacle as the late bishop of winchester's sunday stories
you hold all the trump cards or if you do not you can filch them if you play them with anything like judgement you will find yourselves heads of happy united godfearing families even as did my old friend mr pontifex
true your children will probably find out all about it some day but not until too late to be of much service to them or inconvenience to yourself
some satirists have complained of life inasmuch as all the pleasures belong to the fore part of it and we must see them dwindle till we are left it may be with the miseries of a decrepit old age
to me it seems that youth is like spring an overpraised seasondelightful if it happen to be a favoured one but in practice very rarely favoured and more remarkable as a general rule for biting east winds than genial breezes
autumn is the mellower season and what we lose in flowers we more than gain in fruits
fontenelle at the age of ninety being asked what was the happiest time of his life said he did not know that he had ever been much happier than he then was but that perhaps his best years had been those when he was between fiftyfive and seventyfive and dr johnson placed the pleasures of old age far higher than those of youth
true in old age we live under the shadow of death which like a sword of damocles may descend at any moment but we have so long found life to be an affair of being rather frightened than hurt that we have become like the people who live under vesuvius and chance it without much misgiving
chapter vii   a few words may suffice for the greater number of the young people to whom i have been alluding in the foregoing chapter
eliza and maria the two elder girls were neither exactly pretty nor exactly plain and were in all respects model young ladies but alethea was exceedingly pretty and of a lively affectionate disposition which was in sharp contrast with those of her brothers and sisters
there was a trace of her grandfather not only in her face but in her love of fun of which her father had none though not without a certain boisterous and rather coarse quasihumour which passed for wit with many
john grew up to be a goodlooking gentlemanly fellow with features a trifle too regular and finely chiselled
he dressed himself so nicely had such good address and stuck so steadily to his books that he became a favourite with his masters he had however an instinct for diplomacy and was less popular with the boys
his father in spite of the lectures he would at times read him was in a way proud of him as he grew older he saw in him moreover one who would probably develop into a good man of business and in whose hands the prospects of his house would not be likely to decline
john knew how to humour his father and was at a comparatively early age admitted to as much of his confidence as it was in his nature to bestow on anyone
his brother theobald was no match for him knew it and accepted his fate
he was not so goodlooking as his brother nor was his address so good as a child he had been violently passionate now however he was reserved and shy and i should say indolent in mind and body
he was less tidy than john less well able to assert himself and less skilful in humouring the caprices of his father
i do not think he could have loved anyone heartily but there was no one in his family circle who did not repress rather than invite his affection with the exception of his sister alethea and she was too quick and lively for his somewhat morose temper
he was always the scapegoat and i have sometimes thought he had two fathers to contend againsthis father and his brother john a third and fourth also might almost be added in his sisters eliza and maria
perhaps if he had felt his bondage very acutely he would not have put up with it but he was constitutionally timid and the strong hand of his father knitted him into the closest outward harmony with his brother and sisters
the boys were of use to their father in one respect
i mean that he played them off against each other
he kept them but poorly supplied with pocket money and to theobald would urge that the claims of his elder brother were naturally paramount while he insisted to john upon the fact that he had a numerous family and would affirm solemnly that his expenses were so heavy that at his death there would be very little to divide
he did not care whether they compared notes or no provided they did not do so in his presence
theobald did not complain even behind his father's back
i knew him as intimately as anyone was likely to know him as a child at school and again at cambridge but he very rarely mentioned his father's name even while his father was alive and never once in my hearing afterwards
at school he was not actively disliked as his brother was but he was too dull and deficient in animal spirits to be popular
before he was well out of his frocks it was settled that he was to be a clergyman
it was seemly that mr pontifex the wellknown publisher of religious books should devote at least one of his sons to the church this might tend to bring business or at any rate to keep it in the firm besides mr pontifex had more or less interest with bishops and church dignitaries and might hope that some preferment would be offered to his son through his influence
the boy's future destiny was kept well before his eyes from his earliest childhood and was treated as a matter which he had already virtually settled by his acquiescence
nevertheless a certain show of freedom was allowed him
mr pontifex would say it was only right to give a boy his option and was much too equitable to grudge his son whatever benefit he could derive from this
he had the greatest horror he would exclaim of driving any young man into a profession which he did not like
far be it from him to put pressure upon a son of his as regards any profession and much less when so sacred a calling as the ministry was concerned
he would talk in this way when there were visitors in the house and when his son was in the room
he spoke so wisely and so well that his listening guests considered him a paragon of rightmindedness
he spoke too with such emphasis and his rosy gills and bald head looked so benevolent that it was difficult not to be carried away by his discourse
i believe two or three heads of families in the neighbourhood gave their sons absolute liberty of choice in the matter of their professionsand am not sure that they had not afterwards considerable cause to regret having done so
the visitors seeing theobald look shy and wholly unmoved by the exhibition of so much consideration for his wishes would remark to themselves that the boy seemed hardly likely to be equal to his father and would set him down as an unenthusiastic youth who ought to have more life in him and be more sensible of his advantages than he appeared to be
no one believed in the righteousness of the whole transaction more firmly than the boy himself a sense of being ill at ease kept him silent but it was too profound and too much without break for him to become fully alive to it and come to an understanding with himself
he feared the dark scowl which would come over his father's face upon the slightest opposition
his father's violent threats or coarse sneers would not have been taken au serieux by a stronger boy but theobald was not a strong boy and rightly or wrongly gave his father credit for being quite ready to carry his threats into execution
opposition had never got him anything he wanted yet nor indeed had yielding for the matter of that unless he happened to want exactly what his father wanted for him
if he had ever entertained thoughts of resistance he had none now and the power to oppose was so completely lost for want of exercise that hardly did the wish remain there was nothing left save dull acquiescence as of an ass crouched between two burdens
he may have had an illdefined sense of ideals that were not his actuals he might occasionally dream of himself as a soldier or a sailor far away in foreign lands or even as a farmer's boy upon the wolds but there was not enough in him for there to be any chance of his turning his dreams into realities and he drifted on with his stream which was a slow and i am afraid a muddy one
i think the church catechism has a good deal to do with the unhappy relations which commonly even now exist between parents and children
that work was written too exclusively from the parental point of view the person who composed it did not get a few children to come in and help him he was clearly not young himself nor should i say it was the work of one who liked childrenin spite of the words my good child which if i remember rightly are once put into the mouth of the catechist and after all carry a harsh sound with them
the general impression it leaves upon the mind of the young is that their wickedness at birth was but very imperfectly wiped out at baptism and that the mere fact of being young at all has something with it that savours more or less distinctly of the nature of sin
if a new edition of the work is ever required i should like to introduce a few words insisting on the duty of seeking all reasonable pleasure and avoiding all pain that can be honourably avoided
i should like to see children taught that they should not say they like things which they do not like merely because certain other people say they like them and how foolish it is to say they believe this or that when they understand nothing about it
if it be urged that these additions would make the catechism too long i would curtail the remarks upon our duty towards our neighbour and upon the sacraments
in the place of the paragraph beginning i desire my lord god our heavenly father i wouldbut perhaps i had better return to theobald and leave the recasting of the catechism to abler hands
chapter viii   mr pontifex had set his heart on his son's becoming a fellow of a college before he became a clergyman
this would provide for him at once and would ensure his getting a living if none of his father's ecclesiastical friends gave him one
the boy had done just well enough at school to render this possible so he was sent to one of the smaller colleges at cambridge and was at once set to read with the best private tutors that could be found
a system of examination had been adopted a year or so before theobald took his degree which had improved his chances of a fellowship for whatever ability he had was classical rather than mathematical and this system gave more encouragement to classical studies than had been given hitherto
theobald had the sense to see that he had a chance of independence if he worked hard and he liked the notion of becoming a fellow
he therefore applied himself and in the end took a degree which made his getting a fellowship in all probability a mere question of time
for a while mr pontifex senior was really pleased and told his son he would present him with the works of any standard writer whom he might select
the young man chose the works of bacon and bacon accordingly made his appearance in ten nicely bound volumes
a little inspection however showed that the copy was a second hand one
now that he had taken his degree the next thing to look forward to was ordinationabout which theobald had thought little hitherto beyond acquiescing in it as something that would come as a matter of course some day
now however it had actually come and was asserting itself as a thing which should be only a few months off and this rather frightened him inasmuch as there would be no way out of it when he was once in it
he did not like the near view of ordination as well as the distant one and even made some feeble efforts to escape as may be perceived by the following correspondence which his son ernest found among his father's papers written on giltedged paper in faded ink and tied neatly round with a piece of tape but without any note or comment
i have altered nothing
the letters are as follows     my dear fatheri do not like opening up a question which has been    considered settled but as the time approaches i begin to be very    doubtful how far i am fitted to be a clergyman
not i am thankful to    say that i have the faintest doubts about the church of england and    i could subscribe cordially to every one of the thirtynine articles    which do indeed appear to me to be the ne plus ultra of human    wisdom and paley too leaves no loophole for an opponent but i am    sure i should be running counter to your wishes if i were to conceal    from you that i do not feel the inward call to be a minister of the    gospel that i shall have to say i have felt when the bishop ordains    me
i try to get this feeling i pray for it earnestly and sometimes    half think that i have got it but in a little time it wears off and    though i have no absolute repugnance to being a clergyman and trust    that if i am one i shall endeavour to live to the glory of god and to    advance his interests upon earth yet i feel that something more than    this is wanted before i am fully justified in going into the church
i    am aware that i have been a great expense to you in spite of my    scholarships but you have ever taught me that i should obey my    conscience and my conscience tells me i should do wrong if i became a    clergyman
god may yet give me the spirit for which i assure you i    have been and am continually praying but he may not and in that case    would it not be better for me to try and look out for something else
i know that neither you nor john wish me to go into your business nor    do i understand anything about money matters but is there nothing    else that i can do
i do not like to ask you to maintain me while i    go in for medicine or the bar but when i get my fellowship which    should not be long first i will endeavour to cost you nothing    further and i might make a little money by writing or taking pupils
i trust you will not think this letter improper nothing is further    from my wish than to cause you any uneasiness
i hope you will make    allowance for my present feelings which indeed spring from nothing    but from that respect for my conscience which no one has so often    instilled into me as yourself
pray let me have a few lines shortly
i hope your cold is better
with love to eliza and maria i am your    affectionate son     theobald pontifex
dear theobaldi can enter into your feelings and have no wish to    quarrel with your expression of them
it is quite right and natural    that you should feel as you do except as regards one passage the    impropriety of which you will yourself doubtless feel upon reflection    and to which i will not further allude than to say that it has wounded    me
you should not have said 'in spite of my scholarships'
it was    only proper that if you could do anything to assist me in bearing the    heavy burden of your education the money should be as it was made    over to myself
every line in your letter convinces me that you are    under the influence of a morbid sensitiveness which is one of the    devil's favourite devices for luring people to their destruction
i    have as you say been at great expense with your education
nothing    has been spared by me to give you the advantages which as an english    gentleman i was anxious to afford my son but i am not prepared to    see that expense thrown away and to have to begin again from the    beginning merely because you have taken some foolish scruples into    your head which you should resist as no less unjust to yourself than    to me
don't give way to that restless desire for change which is the bane    of so many persons of both sexes at the present day
of course you needn't be ordained nobody will compel you you are    perfectly free you are twentythree years of age and should know    your own mind but why not have known it sooner instead of never so    much as breathing a hint of opposition until i have had all the    expense of sending you to the university which i should never have    done unless i had believed you to have made up your mind about taking    orders
i have letters from you in which you express the most perfect    willingness to be ordained and your brother and sisters will bear me    out in saying that no pressure of any sort has been put upon you
you    mistake your own mind and are suffering from a nervous timidity which    may be very natural but may not the less be pregnant with serious    consequences to yourself
i am not at all well and the anxiety    occasioned by your letter is naturally preying upon me
may god guide    you to a better judgementyour affectionate father g
pontifex
on the receipt of this letter theobald plucked up his spirits
my father he said to himself tells me i need not be ordained if i do not like
i do not like and therefore i will not be ordained
but what was the meaning of the words 'pregnant with serious consequences to yourself'
did there lurk a threat under these wordsthough it was impossible to lay hold of it or of them
were they not intended to produce all the effect of a threat without being actually threatening
theobald knew his father well enough to be little likely to misapprehend his meaning but having ventured so far on the path of opposition and being really anxious to get out of being ordained if he could he determined to venture farther
he accordingly wrote the following     my dear fatheryou tell meand i heartily thank youthat no one    will compel me to be ordained
i knew you would not press ordination    upon me if my conscience was seriously opposed to it i have therefore    resolved on giving up the idea and believe that if you will continue    to allow me what you do at present until i get my fellowship which    should not be long i will then cease putting you to further expense
i will make up my mind as soon as possible what profession i will    adopt and will let you know at onceyour affectionate son theobald    pontifex
the remaining letter written by return of post must now be given
it has the merit of brevity
dear theobaldi have received yours
i am at a loss to conceive    its motive but am very clear as to its effect
you shall not receive    a single sixpence from me till you come to your senses
should you    persist in your folly and wickedness i am happy to remember that i    have yet other children whose conduct i can depend upon to be a source    of credit and happiness to meyour affectionate but troubled father    g
pontifex
i do not know the immediate sequel to the foregoing correspondence but it all came perfectly right in the end
either theobald's heart failed him or he interpreted the outward shove which his father gave him as the inward call for which i have no doubt he prayed with great earnestnessfor he was a firm believer in the efficacy of prayer
and so am i under certain circumstances
tennyson has said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of but he has wisely refrained from saying whether they are good things or bad things
it might perhaps be as well if the world were to dream of or even become wide awake to some of the things that are being wrought by prayer
but the question is avowedly difficult
in the end theobald got his fellowship by a stroke of luck very soon after taking his degree and was ordained in the autumn of the same year 
chapter ix   mr allaby was rector of crampsford a village a few miles from cambridge
he too had taken a good degree had got a fellowship and in the course of time had accepted a college living of about  pounds a year and a house
his private income did not exceed  pounds a year
on resigning his fellowship he married a woman a good deal younger than himself who bore him eleven children nine of whomtwo sons and seven daughterswere living
the two eldest daughters had married fairly well but at the time of which i am now writing there were still five unmarried of ages varying between thirty and twentytwoand the sons were neither of them yet off their father's hands
it was plain that if anything were to happen to mr allaby the family would be left poorly off and this made both mr and mrs allaby as unhappy as it ought to have made them
reader did you ever have an income at best none too large which died with you all except  pounds a year
did you ever at the same time have two sons who must be started in life somehow and five daughters still unmarried for whom you would only be too thankful to find husbandsif you knew how to find them
if morality is that which on the whole brings a man peace in his declining yearsif that is to say it is not an utter swindle can you under these circumstances flatter yourself that you have led a moral life
and this even though your wife has been so good a woman that you have not grown tired of her and has not fallen into such illhealth as lowers your own health in sympathy and though your family has grown up vigorous amiable and blessed with common sense
i know many old men and women who are reputed moral but who are living with partners whom they have long ceased to love or who have ugly disagreeable maiden daughters for whom they have never been able to find husbandsdaughters whom they loathe and by whom they are loathed in secret or sons whose folly or extravagance is a perpetual wear and worry to them
is it moral for a man to have brought such things upon himself
someone should do for morals what that old pecksniff bacon has obtained the credit of having done for science
but to return to mr and mrs allaby
mrs allaby talked about having married two of her daughters as though it had been the easiest thing in the world
she talked in this way because she heard other mothers do so but in her heart of hearts she did not know how she had done it nor indeed if it had been her doing at all
first there had been a young man in connection with whom she had tried to practise certain manoeuvres which she had rehearsed in imagination over and over again but which she found impossible to apply in practice
then there had been weeks of a wurra wurra of hopes and fears and little stratagems which as often as not proved injudicious and then somehow or other in the end there lay the young man bound and with an arrow through his heart at her daughter's feet
it seemed to her to be all a fluke which she could have little or no hope of repeating
she had indeed repeated it once and might perhaps with good luck repeat it yet once againbut five times over
it was awful why she would rather have three confinements than go through the wear and tear of marrying a single daughter
nevertheless it had got to be done and poor mrs allaby never looked at a young man without an eye to his being a future soninlaw
papas and mammas sometimes ask young men whether their intentions are honourable towards their daughters
i think young men might occasionally ask papas and mammas whether their intentions are honourable before they accept invitations to houses where there are still unmarried daughters
i can't afford a curate my dear said mr allaby to his wife when the pair were discussing what was next to be done
it will be better to get some young man to come and help me for a time upon a sunday
a guinea a sunday will do this and we can chop and change till we get someone who suits
so it was settled that mr allaby's health was not so strong as it had been and that he stood in need of help in the performance of his sunday duty
mrs allaby had a great frienda certain mrs cowey wife of the celebrated professor cowey
she was what was called a truly spiritually minded woman a trifle portly with an incipient beard and an extensive connection among undergraduates more especially among those who were inclined to take part in the great evangelical movement which was then at its height
she gave evening parties once a fortnight at which prayer was part of the entertainment
she was not only spiritually minded but as enthusiastic mrs allaby used to exclaim she was a thorough woman of the world at the same time and had such a fund of strong masculine good sense
she too had daughters but as she used to say to mrs allaby she had been less fortunate than mrs allaby herself for one by one they had married and left her so that her old age would have been desolate indeed if her professor had not been spared to her
mrs cowey of course knew the run of all the bachelor clergy in the university and was the very person to assist mrs allaby in finding an eligible assistant for her husband so this last named lady drove over one morning in the november of  by arrangement to take an early dinner with mrs cowey and spend the afternoon
after dinner the two ladies retired together and the business of the day began
how they fenced how they saw through one another with what loyalty they pretended not to see through one another with what gentle dalliance they prolonged the conversation discussing the spiritual fitness of this or that deacon and the other pros and cons connected with him after his spiritual fitness had been disposed of all this must be left to the imagination of the reader
mrs cowey had been so accustomed to scheming on her own account that she would scheme for anyone rather than not scheme at all
many mothers turned to her in their hour of need and provided they were spiritually minded mrs cowey never failed to do her best for them if the marriage of a young bachelor of arts was not made in heaven it was probably made or at any rate attempted in mrs cowey's drawingroom
on the present occasion all the deacons of the university in whom there lurked any spark of promise were exhaustively discussed and the upshot was that our friend theobald was declared by mrs cowey to be about the best thing she could do that afternoon
i don't know that he's a particularly fascinating young man my dear said mrs cowey and he's only a second son but then he's got his fellowship and even the second son of such a man as mr pontifex the publisher should have something very comfortable
why yes my dear rejoined mrs allaby complacently that's what one rather feels
chapter x   the interview like all other good things had to come to an end the days were short and mrs allaby had a six miles' drive to crampsford
when she was muffled up and had taken her seat mr allaby's factotum james could perceive no change in her appearance and little knew what a series of delightful visions he was driving home along with his mistress
professor cowey had published works through theobald's father and theobald had on this account been taken in tow by mrs cowey from the beginning of his university career
she had had her eye upon him for some time past and almost as much felt it her duty to get him off her list of young men for whom wives had to be provided as poor mrs allaby did to try and get a husband for one of her daughters
she now wrote and asked him to come and see her in terms that awakened his curiosity
when he came she broached the subject of mr allaby's failing health and after the smoothing away of such difficulties as were only mrs cowey's due considering the interest she had taken it was allowed to come to pass that theobald should go to crampsford for six successive sundays and take the half of mr allaby's duty at half a guinea a sunday for mrs cowey cut down the usual stipend mercilessly and theobald was not strong enough to resist
ignorant of the plots which were being prepared for his peace of mind and with no idea beyond that of earning his three guineas and perhaps of astonishing the inhabitants of crampsford by his academic learning theobald walked over to the rectory one sunday morning early in decembera few weeks only after he had been ordained
he had taken a great deal of pains with his sermon which was on the subject of geologythen coming to the fore as a theological bugbear
he showed that so far as geology was worth anything at alland he was too liberal entirely to poohpooh itit confirmed the absolutely historical character of the mosaic account of the creation as given in genesis
any phenomena which at first sight appeared to make against this view were only partial phenomena and broke down upon investigation
nothing could be in more excellent taste and when theobald adjourned to the rectory where he was to dine between the services mr allaby complimented him warmly upon his debut while the ladies of the family could hardly find words with which to express their admiration
theobald knew nothing about women
the only women he had been thrown in contact with were his sisters two of whom were always correcting him and a few school friends whom these had got their father to ask to elmhurst
these young ladies had either been so shy that they and theobald had never amalgamated or they had been supposed to be clever and had said smart things to him
he did not say smart things himself and did not want other people to say them
besides they talked about musicand he hated musicor picturesand he hated picturesor booksand except the classics he hated books
and then sometimes he was wanted to dance with them and he did not know how to dance and did not want to know
at mrs cowey's parties again he had seen some young ladies and had been introduced to them
he had tried to make himself agreeable but was always left with the impression that he had not been successful
the young ladies of mrs cowey's set were by no means the most attractive that might have been found in the university and theobald may be excused for not losing his heart to the greater number of them while if for a minute or two he was thrown in with one of the prettier and more agreeable girls he was almost immediately cut out by someone less bashful than himself and sneaked off feeling as far as the fair sex was concerned like the impotent man at the pool of bethesda
what a really nice girl might have done with him i cannot tell but fate had thrown none such in his way except his youngest sister alethea whom he might perhaps have liked if she had not been his sister
the result of his experience was that women had never done him any good and he was not accustomed to associate them with any pleasure if there was a part of hamlet in connection with them it had been so completely cut out in the edition of the play in which he was required to act that he had come to disbelieve in its existence
as for kissing he had never kissed a woman in his life except his sisterand my own sisters when we were all small children together
over and above these kisses he had until quite lately been required to imprint a solemn flabby kiss night and morning upon his father's cheek and this to the best of my belief was the extent of theobald's knowledge in the matter of kissing at the time of which i am now writing
the result of the foregoing was that he had come to dislike women as mysterious beings whose ways were not as his ways nor their thoughts as his thoughts
with these antecedents theobald naturally felt rather bashful on finding himself the admired of five strange young ladies
i remember when i was a boy myself i was once asked to take tea at a girls' school where one of my sisters was boarding
i was then about twelve years old
everything went off well during teatime for the lady principal of the establishment was present
but there came a time when she went away and i was left alone with the girls
the moment the mistress's back was turned the head girl who was about my own age came up pointed her finger at me made a face and said solemnly a naasty booy
all the girls followed her in rotation making the same gesture and the same reproach upon my being a boy
it gave me a great scare
i believe i cried and i know it was a long time before i could again face a girl without a strong desire to run away
theobald felt at first much as i had myself done at the girls' school but the miss allabys did not tell him he was a nasty boooy
their papa and mamma were so cordial and they themselves lifted him so deftly over conversational stiles that before dinner was over theobald thought the family to be a really very charming one and felt as though he were being appreciated in a way to which he had not hitherto been accustomed
with dinner his shyness wore off
he was by no means plain his academic prestige was very fair
there was nothing about him to lay hold of as unconventional or ridiculous the impression he created upon the young ladies was quite as favourable as that which they had created upon himself for they knew not much more about men than he about women
as soon as he was gone the harmony of the establishment was broken by a storm which arose upon the question which of them it should be who should become mrs pontifex
my dears said their father when he saw that they did not seem likely to settle the matter among themselves wait till tomorrow and then play at cards for him
having said which he retired to his study where he took a nightly glass of whisky and a pipe of tobacco
chapter xi   the next morning saw theobald in his rooms coaching a pupil and the miss allabys in the eldest miss allaby's bedroom playing at cards with theobald for the stakes
the winner was christina the second unmarried daughter then just twenty seven years old and therefore four years older than theobald
the younger sisters complained that it was throwing a husband away to let christina try and catch him for she was so much older that she had no chance but christina showed fight in a way not usual with her for she was by nature yielding and good tempered
her mother thought it better to back her up so the two dangerous ones were packed off then and there on visits to friends some way off and those alone allowed to remain at home whose loyalty could be depended upon
the brothers did not even suspect what was going on and believed their father's getting assistance was because he really wanted it
the sisters who remained at home kept their words and gave christina all the help they could for over and above their sense of fair play they reflected that the sooner theobald was landed the sooner another deacon might be sent for who might be won by themselves
so quickly was all managed that the two unreliable sisters were actually out of the house before theobald's next visitwhich was on the sunday following his first
this time theobald felt quite at home in the house of his new friendsfor so mrs allaby insisted that he should call them
she took she said such a motherly interest in young men especially in clergymen
theobald believed every word she said as he had believed his father and all his elders from his youth up
christina sat next him at dinner and played her cards no less judiciously than she had played them in her sister's bedroom
she smiled and her smile was one of her strong points whenever he spoke to her she went through all her little artlessnesses and set forth all her little wares in what she believed to be their most taking aspect
who can blame her
theobald was not the ideal she had dreamed of when reading byron upstairs with her sisters but he was an actual within the bounds of possibility and after all not a bad actual as actuals went
what else could she do
run away
she dared not
marry beneath her and be considered a disgrace to her family
she dared not
remain at home and become an old maid and be laughed at
not if she could help it
she did the only thing that could reasonably be expected
she was drowning theobald might be only a straw but she could catch at him and catch at him she accordingly did
if the course of true love never runs smooth the course of true match making sometimes does so
the only ground for complaint in the present case was that it was rather slow
theobald fell into the part assigned to him more easily than mrs cowey and mrs allaby had dared to hope
he was softened by christina's winning manners he admired the high moral tone of everything she said her sweetness towards her sisters and her father and mother her readiness to undertake any small burden which no one else seemed willing to undertake her sprightly manners all were fascinating to one who though unused to woman's society was still a human being
he was flattered by her unobtrusive but obviously sincere admiration for himself she seemed to see him in a more favourable light and to understand him better than anyone outside of this charming family had ever done
instead of snubbing him as his father brother and sisters did she drew him out listened attentively to all he chose to say and evidently wanted him to say still more
he told a college friend that he knew he was in love now he really was for he liked miss allaby's society much better than that of his sisters
over and above the recommendations already enumerated she had another in the possession of what was supposed to be a very beautiful contralto voice
her voice was certainly contralto for she could not reach higher than d in the treble its only defect was that it did not go correspondingly low in the bass in those days however a contralto voice was understood to include even a soprano if the soprano could not reach soprano notes and it was not necessary that it should have the quality which we now assign to contralto
what her voice wanted in range and power was made up in the feeling with which she sang
she had transposed angels ever bright and fair into a lower key so as to make it suit her voice thus proving as her mamma said that she had a thorough knowledge of the laws of harmony not only did she do this but at every pause added an embellishment of arpeggios from one end to the other of the keyboard on a principle which her governess had taught her she thus added life and interest to an air which everyoneso she saidmust feel to be rather heavy in the form in which handel left it
as for her governess she indeed had been a rarely accomplished musician she was a pupil of the famous dr clarke of cambridge and used to play the overture to atalanta arranged by mazzinghi
nevertheless it was some time before theobald could bring his courage to the sticking point of actually proposing
he made it quite clear that he believed himself to be much smitten but month after month went by during which there was still so much hope in theobald that mr allaby dared not discover that he was able to do his duty for himself and was getting impatient at the number of halfguineas he was disbursingand yet there was no proposal
christina's mother assured him that she was the best daughter in the whole world and would be a priceless treasure to the man who married her
theobald echoed mrs allaby's sentiments with warmth but still though he visited the rectory two or three times a week besides coming over on sundayshe did not propose
she is heartwhole yet dear mr pontifex said mrs allaby one day at least i believe she is
it is not for want of admirersoh
noshe has had her full share of these but she is too too difficult to please
i think however she would fall before a great and good man
and she looked hard at theobald who blushed but the days went by and still he did not propose
another time theobald actually took mrs cowey into his confidence and the reader may guess what account of christina he got from her
mrs cowey tried the jealousy manoeuvre and hinted at a possible rival
theobald was or pretended to be very much alarmed a little rudimentary pang of jealousy shot across his bosom and he began to believe with pride that he was not only in love but desperately in love or he would never feel so jealous
nevertheless day after day still went by and he did not propose
the allabys behaved with great judgement
they humoured him till his retreat was practically cut off though he still flattered himself that it was open
one day about six months after theobald had become an almost daily visitor at the rectory the conversation happened to turn upon long engagements
i don't like long engagements mr allaby do you
said theobald imprudently
no said mr allaby in a pointed tone nor long courtships and he gave theobald a look which he could not pretend to misunderstand
he went back to cambridge as fast as he could go and in dread of the conversation with mr allaby which he felt to be impending composed the following letter which he despatched that same afternoon by a private messenger to crampsford
the letter was as follows     dearest miss christinai do not know whether you have guessed the    feelings that i have long entertained for youfeelings which i have    concealed as much as i could through fear of drawing you into an    engagement which if you enter into it must be prolonged for a    considerable time but however this may be it is out of my power to    conceal them longer i love you ardently devotedly and send these    few lines asking you to be my wife because i dare not trust my tongue    to give adequate expression to the magnitude of my affection for you
i cannot pretend to offer you a heart which has never known either    love or disappointment
i have loved already and my heart was years    in recovering from the grief i felt at seeing her become another's
that however is over and having seen yourself i rejoice over a    disappointment which i thought at one time would have been fatal to    me
it has left me a less ardent lover than i should perhaps    otherwise have been but it has increased tenfold my power of    appreciating your many charms and my desire that you should become my    wife
please let me have a few lines of answer by the bearer to let    me know whether or not my suit is accepted
if you accept me i will    at once come and talk the matter over with mr and mrs allaby whom i    shall hope one day to be allowed to call father and mother
i ought to warn you that in the event of your consenting to be my    wife it may be years before our union can be consummated for i cannot    marry till a college living is offered me
if therefore you see fit    to reject me i shall be grieved rather than surprisedever most    devotedly yours     theobald pontifex
and this was all that his public school and university education had been able to do for theobald
nevertheless for his own part he thought his letter rather a good one and congratulated himself in particular upon his cleverness in inventing the story of a previous attachment behind which he intended to shelter himself if christina should complain of any lack of fervour in his behaviour to her
i need not give christina's answer which of course was to accept
much as theobald feared old mr allaby i do not think he would have wrought up his courage to the point of actually proposing but for the fact of the engagement being necessarily a long one during which a dozen things might turn up to break it off
however much he may have disapproved of long engagements for other people i doubt whether he had any particular objection to them in his own case
a pair of lovers are like sunset and sunrise there are such things every day but we very seldom see them
theobald posed as the most ardent lover imaginable but to use the vulgarism for the moment in fashion it was all side
christina was in love as indeed she had been twenty times already
but then christina was impressionable and could not even hear the name missolonghi mentioned without bursting into tears
when theobald accidentally left his sermon case behind him one sunday she slept with it in her bosom and was forlorn when she had as it were to disgorge it on the following sunday but i do not think theobald ever took so much as an old toothbrush of christina's to bed with him
why i knew a young man once who got hold of his mistress's skates and slept with them for a fortnight and cried when he had to give them up
chapter xii   theobald's engagement was all very well as far as it went but there was an old gentleman with a bald head and rosy cheeks in a countinghouse in paternoster row who must sooner or later be told of what his son had in view and theobald's heart fluttered when he asked himself what view this old gentleman was likely to take of the situation
the murder however had to come out and theobald and his intended perhaps imprudently resolved on making a clean breast of it at once
he wrote what he and christina who helped him to draft the letter thought to be everything that was filial and expressed himself as anxious to be married with the least possible delay
he could not help saying this as christina was at his shoulder and he knew it was safe for his father might be trusted not to help him
he wound up by asking his father to use any influence that might be at his command to help him to get a living inasmuch as it might be years before a college living fell vacant and he saw no other chance of being able to marry for neither he nor his intended had any money except theobald's fellowship which would of course lapse on his taking a wife
any step of theobald's was sure to be objectionable in his father's eyes but that at threeandtwenty he should want to marry a penniless girl who was four years older than himself afforded a golden opportunity which the old gentlemanfor so i may now call him as he was at least sixtyembraced with characteristic eagerness
the ineffable folly he wrote on receiving his son's letter of    your fancied passion for miss allaby fills me with the gravest    apprehensions
making every allowance for a lover's blindness i    still have no doubt that the lady herself is a wellconducted and    amiable young person who would not disgrace our family but were she    ten times more desirable as a daughterinlaw than i can allow myself    to hope your joint poverty is an insuperable objection to your    marriage
i have four other children besides yourself and my    expenses do not permit me to save money
this year they have been    especially heavy indeed i have had to purchase two not inconsiderable    pieces of land which happened to come into the market and were    necessary to complete a property which i have long wanted to round off    in this way
i gave you an education regardless of expense which has    put you in possession of a comfortable income at an age when many    young men are dependent
i have thus started you fairly in life and    may claim that you should cease to be a drag upon me further
long    engagements are proverbially unsatisfactory and in the present case    the prospect seems interminable
what interest pray do you suppose    i have that i could get a living for you
can i go up and down the    country begging people to provide for my son because he has taken it    into his head to want to get married without sufficient means
i do not wish to write unkindly nothing can be farther from my real    feelings towards you but there is often more kindness in plain    speaking than in any amount of soft words which can end in no    substantial performance
of course i bear in mind that you are of    age and can therefore please yourself but if you choose to claim the    strict letter of the law and act without consideration for your    father's feelings you must not be surprised if you one day find that    i have claimed a like liberty for myselfbelieve me your    affectionate father g
pontifex
i found this letter along with those already given and a few more which i need not give but throughout which the same tone prevails and in all of which there is the more or less obvious shake of the will near the end of the letter
remembering theobald's general dumbness concerning his father for the many years i knew him after his father's death there was an eloquence in the preservation of the letters and in their endorsement letters from my father which seemed to have with it some faint odour of health and nature
theobald did not show his father's letter to christina nor indeed i believe to anyone
he was by nature secretive and had been repressed too much and too early to be capable of railing or blowing off steam where his father was concerned
his sense of wrong was still inarticulate felt as a dull dead weight ever present day by day and if he woke at nighttime still continually present but he hardly knew what it was
i was about the closest friend he had and i saw but little of him for i could not get on with him for long together
he said i had no reverence whereas i thought that i had plenty of reverence for what deserved to be revered but that the gods which he deemed golden were in reality made of baser metal
he never as i have said complained of his father to me and his only other friends were like himself staid and prim of evangelical tendencies and deeply imbued with a sense of the sinfulness of any act of insubordination to parentsgood young men in factand one cannot blow off steam to a good young man
when christina was informed by her lover of his father's opposition and of the time which must probably elapse before they could be married she offeredwith how much sincerity i know notto set him free from his engagement but theobald declined to be releasednot at least as he said at present
christina and mrs allaby knew they could manage him and on this not very satisfactory footing the engagement was continued
his engagement and his refusal to be released at once raised theobald in his own good opinion
dull as he was he had no small share of quiet selfapprobation
he admired himself for his university distinction for the purity of his life i said of him once that if he had only a better temper he would be as innocent as a newlaid egg and for his unimpeachable integrity in money matters
he did not despair of advancement in the church when he had once got a living and of course it was within the bounds of possibility that he might one day become a bishop and christina said she felt convinced that this would ultimately be the case
as was natural for the daughter and intended wife of a clergyman christina's thoughts ran much upon religion and she was resolved that even though an exalted position in this world were denied to her and theobald their virtues should be fully appreciated in the next
her religious opinions coincided absolutely with theobald's own and many a conversation did she have with him about the glory of god and the completeness with which they would devote themselves to it as soon as theobald had got his living and they were married
so certain was she of the great results which would then ensue that she wondered at times at the blindness shown by providence towards its own truest interests in not killing off the rectors who stood between theobald and his living a little faster
in those days people believed with a simple downrightness which i do not observe among educated men and women now
it had never so much as crossed theobald's mind to doubt the literal accuracy of any syllable in the bible
he had never seen any book in which this was disputed nor met with anyone who doubted it
true there was just a little scare about geology but there was nothing in it
if it was said that god made the world in six days why he did make it in six days neither in more nor less if it was said that he put adam to sleep took out one of his ribs and made a woman of it why it was so as a matter of course
he adam went to sleep as it might be himself theobald pontifex in a garden as it might be the garden at crampsford rectory during the summer months when it was so pretty only that it was larger and had some tame wild animals in it
then god came up to him as it might be mr allaby or his father dexterously took out one of his ribs without waking him and miraculously healed the wound so that no trace of the operation remained
finally god had taken the rib perhaps into the greenhouse and had turned it into just such another young woman as christina
that was how it was done there was neither difficulty nor shadow of difficulty about the matter
could not god do anything he liked and had he not in his own inspired book told us that he had done this
this was the average attitude of fairly educated young men and women towards the mosaic cosmogony fifty forty or even twenty years ago
the combating of infidelity therefore offered little scope for enterprising young clergymen nor had the church awakened to the activity which she has since displayed among the poor in our large towns
these were then left almost without an effort at resistance or cooperation to the labours of those who had succeeded wesley
missionary work indeed in heathen countries was being carried on with some energy but theobald did not feel any call to be a missionary
christina suggested this to him more than once and assured him of the unspeakable happiness it would be to her to be the wife of a missionary and to share his dangers she and theobald might even be martyred of course they would be martyred simultaneously and martyrdom many years hence as regarded from the arbour in the rectory garden was not painful it would ensure them a glorious future in the next world and at any rate posthumous renown in thiseven if they were not miraculously restored to life againand such things had happened ere now in the case of martyrs
theobald however had not been kindled by christina's enthusiasm so she fell back upon the church of romean enemy more dangerous if possible than paganism itself
a combat with romanism might even yet win for her and theobald the crown of martyrdom
true the church of rome was tolerably quiet just then but it was the calm before the storm of this she was assured with a conviction deeper than she could have attained by any argument founded upon mere reason
we dearest theobald she exclaimed will be ever faithful
we will stand firm and support one another even in the hour of death itself
god in his mercy may spare us from being burnt alive
he may or may not do so
oh lord and she turned her eyes prayerfully to heaven spare my theobald or grant that he may be beheaded
my dearest said theobald gravely do not let us agitate ourselves unduly
if the hour of trial comes we shall be best prepared to meet it by having led a quiet unobtrusive life of selfdenial and devotion to god's glory
such a life let us pray god that it may please him to enable us to pray that we may lead
dearest theobald exclaimed christina drying the tears that had gathered in her eyes you are always always right
let us be selfdenying pure upright truthful in word and deed
she clasped her hands and looked up to heaven as she spoke
dearest rejoined her lover we have ever hitherto endeavoured to be all of these things we have not been worldly people let us watch and pray that we may so continue to the end
the moon had risen and the arbour was getting damp so they adjourned further aspirations for a more convenient season
at other times christina pictured herself and theobald as braving the scorn of almost every human being in the achievement of some mighty task which should redound to the honour of her redeemer
she could face anything for this
but always towards the end of her vision there came a little coronation scene high up in the golden regions of the heavens and a diadem was set upon her head by the son of man himself amid a host of angels and archangels who looked on with envy and admirationand here even theobald himself was out of it
if there could be such a thing as the mammon of righteousness christina would have assuredly made friends with it
her papa and mamma were very estimable people and would in the course of time receive heavenly mansions in which they would be exceedingly comfortable so doubtless would her sisters so perhaps even might her brothers but for herself she felt that a higher destiny was preparing which it was her duty never to lose sight of
the first step towards it would be her marriage with theobald
in spite however of these flights of religious romanticism christina was a goodtempered kindlynatured girl enough who if she had married a sensible laymanwe will say a hotelkeeperwould have developed into a good landlady and been deservedly popular with her guests
such was theobald's engaged life
many a little present passed between the pair and many a small surprise did they prepare pleasantly for one another
they never quarrelled and neither of them ever flirted with anyone else
mrs allaby and his future sistersinlaw idolised theobald in spite of its being impossible to get another deacon to come and be played for as long as theobald was able to help mr allaby which now of course he did free gratis and for nothing two of the sisters however did manage to find husbands before christina was actually married and on each occasion theobald played the part of decoy elephant
in the end only two out of the seven daughters remained single
after three or four years old mr pontifex became accustomed to his son's engagement and looked upon it as among the things which had now a prescriptive right to toleration
in the spring of  more than five years after theobald had first walked over to crampsford one of the best livings in the gift of the college unexpectedly fell vacant and was for various reasons declined by the two fellows senior to theobald who might each have been expected to take it
the living was then offered to and of course accepted by theobald being in value not less than  pounds a year with a suitable house and garden
old mr pontifex then came down more handsomely than was expected and settled  pounds on his son and daughterinlaw for life with remainder to such of their issue as they might appoint
in the month of july  theobald and christina became man and wife
chapter xiii   a due number of old shoes had been thrown at the carriage in which the happy pair departed from the rectory and it had turned the corner at the bottom of the village
it could then be seen for two or three hundred yards creeping past a fir coppice and after this was lost to view
john said mr allaby to his manservant shut the gate and he went indoors with a sigh of relief which seemed to say i have done it and i am alive
this was the reaction after a burst of enthusiastic merriment during which the old gentleman had run twenty yards after the carriage to fling a slipper at itwhich he had duly flung
but what were the feelings of theobald and christina when the village was passed and they were rolling quietly by the fir plantation
it is at this point that even the stoutest heart must fail unless it beat in the breast of one who is over head and ears in love
if a young man is in a small boat on a choppy sea along with his affianced bride and both are seasick and if the sick swain can forget his own anguish in the happiness of holding the fair one's head when she is at her worstthen he is in love and his heart will be in no danger of failing him as he passes his fir plantation
other people and unfortunately by far the greater number of those who get married must be classed among the other people will inevitably go through a quarter or half an hour of greater or less badness as the case may be
taking numbers into account i should think more mental suffering had been undergone in the streets leading from st george's hanover square than in the condemned cells of newgate
there is no time at which what the italians call la figlia della morte lays her cold hand upon a man more awfully than during the first half hour that he is alone with a woman whom he has married but never genuinely loved
death's daughter did not spare theobald
he had behaved very well hitherto
when christina had offered to let him go he had stuck to his post with a magnanimity on which he had plumed himself ever since
from that time forward he had said to himself i at any rate am the very soul of honour i am not etc etc
true at the moment of magnanimity the actual cash payment so to speak was still distant when his father gave formal consent to his marriage things began to look more serious when the college living had fallen vacant and been accepted they looked more serious still but when christina actually named the day then theobald's heart fainted within him
the engagement had gone on so long that he had got into a groove and the prospect of change was disconcerting
christina and he had got on he thought to himself very nicely for a great number of years whywhywhy should they not continue to go on as they were doing now for the rest of their lives
but there was no more chance of escape for him than for the sheep which is being driven to the butcher's back premises and like the sheep he felt that there was nothing to be gained by resistance so he made none
he behaved in fact with decency and was declared on all hands to be one of the happiest men imaginable
now however to change the metaphor the drop had actually fallen and the poor wretch was hanging in mid air along with the creature of his affections
this creature was now thirtythree years old and looked it she had been weeping and her eyes and nose were reddish if i have done it and i am alive was written on mr allaby's face after he had thrown the shoe i have done it and i do not see how i can possibly live much longer was upon the face of theobald as he was being driven along by the fir plantation
this however was not apparent at the rectory
all that could be seen there was the bobbing up and down of the postilion's head which just overtopped the hedge by the roadside as he rose in his stirrups and the black and yellow body of the carriage
for some time the pair said nothing what they must have felt during their first half hour the reader must guess for it is beyond my power to tell him at the end of that time however theobald had rummaged up a conclusion from some odd corner of his soul to the effect that now he and christina were married the sooner they fell into their future mutual relations the better
if people who are in a difficulty will only do the first little reasonable thing which they can clearly recognise as reasonable they will always find the next step more easy both to see and take
what then thought theobald was here at this moment the first and most obvious matter to be considered and what would be an equitable view of his and christina's relative positions in respect to it
clearly their first dinner was their first joint entry into the duties and pleasures of married life
no less clearly it was christina's duty to order it and his own to eat it and pay for it
the arguments leading to this conclusion and the conclusion itself flashed upon theobald about three and a half miles after he had left crampsford on the road to newmarket
he had breakfasted early but his usual appetite had failed him
they had left the vicarage at noon without staying for the wedding breakfast
theobald liked an early dinner it dawned upon him that he was beginning to be hungry from this to the conclusion stated in the preceding paragraph the steps had been easy
after a few minutes' further reflection he broached the matter to his bride and thus the ice was broken
mrs theobald was not prepared for so sudden an assumption of importance
her nerves never of the strongest had been strung to their highest tension by the event of the morning
she wanted to escape observation she was conscious of looking a little older than she quite liked to look as a bride who had been married that morning she feared the landlady the chambermaid the waitereverybody and everything her heart beat so fast that she could hardly speak much less go through the ordeal of ordering dinner in a strange hotel with a strange landlady
she begged and prayed to be let off
if theobald would only order dinner this once she would order it any day and every day in future
but the inexorable theobald was not to be put off with such absurd excuses
he was master now
had not christina less than two hours ago promised solemnly to honour and obey him and was she turning restive over such a trifle as this
the loving smile departed from his face and was succeeded by a scowl which that old turk his father might have envied
stuff and nonsense my dearest christina he exclaimed mildly and stamped his foot upon the floor of the carriage
it is a wife's duty to order her husband's dinner you are my wife and i shall expect you to order mine
for theobald was nothing if he was not logical
the bride began to cry and said he was unkind whereon he said nothing but revolved unutterable things in his heart
was this then the end of his six years of unflagging devotion
was it for this that when christina had offered to let him off he had stuck to his engagement
was this the outcome of her talks about duty and spiritual mindednessthat now upon the very day of her marriage she should fail to see that the first step in obedience to god lay in obedience to himself
he would drive back to crampsford he would complain to mr and mrs allaby he didn't mean to have married christina he hadn't married her it was all a hideous dream he wouldbut a voice kept ringing in his ears which said you can't can't can't
can't i
screamed the unhappy creature to himself
no said the remorseless voice you can't
you are a married man
he rolled back in his corner of the carriage and for the first time felt how iniquitous were the marriage laws of england
but he would buy milton's prose works and read his pamphlet on divorce
he might perhaps be able to get them at newmarket
so the bride sat crying in one corner of the carriage and the bridegroom sulked in the other and he feared her as only a bridegroom can fear
presently however a feeble voice was heard from the bride's corner saying  dearest theobalddearest theobald forgive me i have been very very wrong
please do not be angry with me
i will order thethe but the word dinner was checked by rising sobs
when theobald heard these words a load began to be lifted from his heart but he only looked towards her and that not too pleasantly
please tell me continued the voice what you think you would like and i will tell the landlady when we get to newmar but another burst of sobs checked the completion of the word
the load on theobald's heart grew lighter and lighter
was it possible that she might not be going to henpeck him after all
besides had she not diverted his attention from herself to his approaching dinner
he swallowed down more of his apprehensions and said but still gloomily i think we might have a roast fowl with bread sauce new potatoes and green peas and then we will see if they could let us have a cherry tart and some cream
after a few minutes more he drew her towards him kissed away her tears and assured her that he knew she would be a good wife to him
dearest theobald she exclaimed in answer you are an angel
theobald believed her and in ten minutes more the happy couple alighted at the inn at newmarket
bravely did christina go through her arduous task
eagerly did she beseech the landlady in secret not to keep her theobald waiting longer than was absolutely necessary
if you have any soup ready you know mrs barber it might save ten minutes for we might have it while the fowl was browning
see how necessity had nerved her
but in truth she had a splitting headache and would have given anything to have been alone
the dinner was a success
a pint of sherry had warmed theobald's heart and he began to hope that after all matters might still go well with him
he had conquered in the first battle and this gives great prestige
how easy it had been too
why had he never treated his sisters in this way
he would do so next time he saw them he might in time be able to stand up to his brother john or even his father
thus do we build castles in air when flushed with wine and conquest
the end of the honeymoon saw mrs theobald the most devotedly obsequious wife in all england
according to the old saying theobald had killed the cat at the beginning
it had been a very little cat a mere kitten in fact or he might have been afraid to face it but such as it had been he had challenged it to mortal combat and had held up its dripping head defiantly before his wife's face
the rest had been easy
strange that one whom i have described hitherto as so timid and easily put upon should prove such a tartar all of a sudden on the day of his marriage
perhaps i have passed over his years of courtship too rapidly
during these he had become a tutor of his college and had at last been junior dean
i never yet knew a man whose sense of his own importance did not become adequately developed after he had held a resident fellowship for five or six years
trueimmediately on arriving within a ten mile radius of his father's house an enchantment fell upon him so that his knees waxed weak his greatness departed and he again felt himself like an overgrown baby under a perpetual cloud but then he was not often at elmhurst and as soon as he left it the spell was taken off again once more he became the fellow and tutor of his college the junior dean the betrothed of christina the idol of the allaby womankind
from all which it may be gathered that if christina had been a barbary hen and had ruffled her feathers in any show of resistance theobald would not have ventured to swagger with her but she was not a barbary hen she was only a common hen and that too with rather a smaller share of personal bravery than hens generally have
chapter xiv   battersbyonthehill was the name of the village of which theobald was now rector
it contained  or  inhabitants scattered over a rather large area and consisting entirely of farmers and agricultural labourers
the rectory was commodious and placed on the brow of a hill which gave it a delightful prospect
there was a fair sprinkling of neighbours within visiting range but with one or two exceptions they were the clergymen and clergymen's families of the surrounding villages
by these the pontifexes were welcomed as great acquisitions to the neighbourhood
mr pontifex they said was so clever he had been senior classic and senior wrangler a perfect genius in fact and yet with so much sound practical common sense as well
as son of such a distinguished man as the great mr pontifex the publisher he would come into a large property byandby
was there not an elder brother
yes but there would be so much that theobald would probably get something very considerable
of course they would give dinner parties
and mrs pontifex what a charming woman she was she was certainly not exactly pretty perhaps but then she had such a sweet smile and her manner was so bright and winning
she was so devoted too to her husband and her husband to her they really did come up to one's ideas of what lovers used to be in days of old it was rare to meet with such a pair in these degenerate times it was quite beautiful etc etc
such were the comments of the neighbours on the new arrivals
as for theobald's own parishioners the farmers were civil and the labourers and their wives obsequious
there was a little dissent the legacy of a careless predecessor but as mrs theobald said proudly i think theobald may be trusted to deal with that
the church was then an interesting specimen of late norman with some early english additions
it was what in these days would be called in a very bad state of repair but forty or fifty years ago few churches were in good repair
if there is one feature more characteristic of the present generation than another it is that it has been a great restorer of churches
horace preached church restoration in his ode     delicta majorum immeritus lues    romane donec templa refeceris       aedesque labentes deorum et          foeda nigro simulacra fumo
nothing went right with rome for long together after the augustan age but whether it was because she did restore the temples or because she did not restore them i know not
they certainly went all wrong after constantine's time and yet rome is still a city of some importance
i may say here that before theobald had been many years at battersby he found scope for useful work in the rebuilding of battersby church which he carried out at considerable cost towards which he subscribed liberally himself
he was his own architect and this saved expense but architecture was not very well understood about the year  when theobald commenced operations and the result is not as satisfactory as it would have been if he had waited a few years longer
every man's work whether it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else is always a portrait of himself and the more he tries to conceal himself the more clearly will his character appear in spite of him
i may very likely be condemning myself all the time that i am writing this book for i know that whether i like it or no i am portraying myself more surely than i am portraying any of the characters whom i set before the reader
i am sorry that it is so but i cannot help itafter which sop to nemesis i will say that battersby church in its amended form has always struck me as a better portrait of theobald than any sculptor or painter short of a great master would be able to produce
i remember staying with theobald some six or seven months after he was married and while the old church was still standing
i went to church and felt as naaman must have felt on certain occasions when he had to accompany his master on his return after having been cured of his leprosy
i have carried away a more vivid recollection of this and of the people than of theobald's sermon
even now i can see the men in blue smock frocks reaching to their heels and more than one old woman in a scarlet cloak the row of stolid dull vacant ploughboys ungainly in build uncomely in face lifeless apathetic a race a good deal more like the prerevolution french peasant as described by carlyle than is pleasant to reflect upona race now supplanted by a smarter comelier and more hopeful generation which has discovered that it too has a right to as much happiness as it can get and with clearer ideas about the best means of getting it
they shamble in one after another with steaming breath for it is winter and loud clattering of hobnailed boots they beat the snow from off them as they enter and through the opened door i catch a momentary glimpse of a dreary leaden sky and snowclad tombstones
somehow or other i find the strain which handel has wedded to the words there the ploughman near at hand has got into my head and there is no getting it out again
how marvellously old handel understood these people
they bob to theobald as they passed the reading desk the people hereabouts are truly respectful whispered christina to me they know their betters
 and take their seats in a long row against the wall
the choir clamber up into the gallery with their instrumentsa violoncello a clarinet and a trombone
i see them and soon i hear them for there is a hymn before the service a wild strain a remnant if i mistake not of some prereformation litany
i have heard what i believe was its remote musical progenitor in the church of ss
giovanni e paolo at venice not five years since and again i have heard it far away in mid atlantic upon a grey seasabbath in june when neither winds nor waves are stirring so that the emigrants gather on deck and their plaintive psalm goes forth upon the silver haze of the sky and on the wilderness of a sea that has sighed till it can sigh no longer
or it may be heard at some methodist camp meeting upon a welsh hillside but in the churches it is gone for ever
if i were a musician i would take it as the subject for the adagio in a wesleyan symphony
gone now are the clarinet the violoncello and the trombone wild minstrelsy as of the doleful creatures in ezekiel discordant but infinitely pathetic
gone is that scarebabe stentor that bellowing bull of bashan the village blacksmith gone is the melodious carpenter gone the brawny shepherd with the red hair who roared more lustily than all until they came to the words shepherds with your flocks abiding when modesty covered him with confusion and compelled him to be silent as though his own health were being drunk
they were doomed and had a presentiment of evil even when first i saw them but they had still a little lease of choir life remaining and they roared out     wicked hands have pierced and nailed him pierced and nailed him to    a tree
but no description can give a proper idea of the effect
when i was last in battersby church there was a harmonium played by a sweetlooking girl with a choir of school children around her and they chanted the canticles to the most correct of chants and they sang hymns ancient and modern the high pews were gone nay the very gallery in which the old choir had sung was removed as an accursed thing which might remind the people of the high places and theobald was old and christina was lying under the yew trees in the churchyard
but in the evening later on i saw three very old men come chuckling out of a dissenting chapel and surely enough they were my old friends the blacksmith the carpenter and the shepherd
there was a look of content upon their faces which made me feel certain they had been singing not doubtless with the old glory of the violoncello the clarinet and the trombone but still songs of sion and no new fangled papistry
chapter xv   the hymn had engaged my attention when it was over i had time to take stock of the congregation
they were chiefly farmersfat very wellto do folk who had come some of them with their wives and children from outlying farms two and three miles away haters of popery and of anything which any one might choose to say was popish good sensible fellows who detested theory of any kind whose ideal was the maintenance of the status quo with perhaps a loving reminiscence of old war times and a sense of wrong that the weather was not more completely under their control who desired higher prices and cheaper wages but otherwise were most contented when things were changing least tolerators if not lovers of all that was familiar haters of all that was unfamiliar they would have been equally horrified at hearing the christian religion doubted and at seeing it practised
what can there be in common between theobald and his parishioners
said christina to me in the course of the evening when her husband was for a few moments absent
of course one must not complain but i assure you it grieves me to see a man of theobald's ability thrown away upon such a place as this
if we had only been at gaysbury where there are the a's the b's the c's and lord d's place as you know quite close i should not then have felt that we were living in such a desert but i suppose it is for the best she added more cheerfully and then of course the bishop will come to us whenever he is in the neighbourhood and if we were at gaysbury he might have gone to lord d's
perhaps i have now said enough to indicate the kind of place in which theobald's lines were cast and the sort of woman he had married
as for his own habits i see him trudging through muddy lanes and over long sweeps of ploverhaunted pastures to visit a dying cottager's wife
he takes her meat and wine from his own table and that not a little only but liberally
according to his lights also he administers what he is pleased to call spiritual consolation
i am afraid i'm going to hell sir says the sick woman with a whine
oh sir save me save me don't let me go there
i couldn't stand it sir i should die with fear the very thought of it drives me into a cold sweat all over
mrs thompson says theobald gravely you must have faith in the precious blood of your redeemer it is he alone who can save you
but are you sure sir says she looking wistfully at him that he will forgive mefor i've not been a very good woman indeed i haven'tand if god would only say 'yes' outright with his mouth when i ask whether my sins are forgiven me  but they are forgiven you mrs thompson says theobald with some sternness for the same ground has been gone over a good many times already and he has borne the unhappy woman's misgivings now for a full quarter of an hour
then he puts a stop to the conversation by repeating prayers taken from the visitation of the sick and overawes the poor wretch from expressing further anxiety as to her condition
can't you tell me sir she exclaims piteously as she sees that he is preparing to go away can't you tell me that there is no day of judgement and that there is no such place as hell
i can do without the heaven sir but i cannot do with the hell
theobald is much shocked
mrs thompson he rejoins impressively let me implore you to suffer no doubt concerning these two cornerstones of our religion to cross your mind at a moment like the present
if there is one thing more certain than another it is that we shall all appear before the judgement seat of christ and that the wicked will be consumed in a lake of everlasting fire
doubt this mrs thompson and you are lost
the poor woman buries her fevered head in the coverlet in a paroxysm of fear which at last finds relief in tears
mrs thompson says theobald with his hand on the door compose yourself be calm you must please to take my word for it that at the day of judgement your sins will be all washed white in the blood of the lamb mrs thompson
yea he exclaims frantically though they be as scarlet yet shall they be as white as wool and he makes off as fast as he can from the fetid atmosphere of the cottage to the pure air outside
oh how thankful he is when the interview is over
he returns home conscious that he has done his duty and administered the comforts of religion to a dying sinner
his admiring wife awaits him at the rectory and assures him that never yet was clergyman so devoted to the welfare of his flock
he believes her he has a natural tendency to believe everything that is told him and who should know the facts of the case better than his wife
poor fellow
he has done his best but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water
he has left meat and winethat he can do he will call again and will leave more meat and wine day after day he trudges over the same ploverhaunted fields and listens at the end of his walk to the same agony of forebodings which day after day he silences but does not remove till at last a merciful weakness renders the sufferer careless of her future and theobald is satisfied that her mind is now peacefully at rest in jesus
chapter xvi   he does not like this branch of his professionindeed he hates itbut will not admit it to himself
the habit of not admitting things to himself has become a confirmed one with him
nevertheless there haunts him an ill defined sense that life would be pleasanter if there were no sick sinners or if they would at any rate face an eternity of torture with more indifference
he does not feel that he is in his element
the farmers look as if they were in their element
they are fullbodied healthy and contented but between him and them there is a great gulf fixed
a hard and drawn look begins to settle about the corners of his mouth so that even if he were not in a black coat and white tie a child might know him for a parson
he knows that he is doing his duty
every day convinces him of this more firmly but then there is not much duty for him to do
he is sadly in want of occupation
he has no taste for any of those field sports which were not considered unbecoming for a clergyman forty years ago
he does not ride nor shoot nor fish nor course nor play cricket
study to do him justice he had never really liked and what inducement was there for him to study at battersby
he reads neither old books nor new ones
he does not interest himself in art or science or politics but he sets his back up with some promptness if any of them show any development unfamiliar to himself
true he writes his own sermons but even his wife considers that his forte lies rather in the example of his life which is one long act of selfdevotion than in his utterances from the pulpit
after breakfast he retires to his study he cuts little bits out of the bible and gums them with exquisite neatness by the side of other little bits this he calls making a harmony of the old and new testaments
alongside the extracts he copies in the very perfection of handwriting extracts from mede the only man according to theobald who really understood the book of revelation patrick and other old divines
he works steadily at this for half an hour every morning during many years and the result is doubtless valuable
after some years have gone by he hears his children their lessons and the daily oftrepeated screams that issue from the study during the lesson hours tell their own horrible story over the house
he has also taken to collecting a hortus siccus and through the interest of his father was once mentioned in the saturday magazine as having been the first to find a plant whose name i have forgotten in the neighbourhood of battersby
this number of the saturday magazine has been bound in red morocco and is kept upon the drawingroom table
he potters about his garden if he hears a hen cackling he runs and tells christina and straightway goes hunting for the egg
when the two miss allabys came as they sometimes did to stay with christina they said the life led by their sister and brotherinlaw was an idyll
happy indeed was christina in her choice for that she had had a choice was a fiction which soon took root among themand happy theobald in his christina
somehow or other christina was always a little shy of cards when her sisters were staying with her though at other times she enjoyed a game of cribbage or a rubber of whist heartily enough but her sisters knew they would never be asked to battersby again if they were to refer to that little matter and on the whole it was worth their while to be asked to battersby
if theobald's temper was rather irritable he did not vent it upon them
by nature reserved if he could have found someone to cook his dinner for him he would rather have lived in a desert island than not
in his heart of hearts he held with pope that the greatest nuisance to mankind is man or words to that effectonly that women with the exception perhaps of christina were worse
yet for all this when visitors called he put a better face on it than anyone who was behind the scenes would have expected
he was quick too at introducing the names of any literary celebrities whom he had met at his father's house and soon established an allround reputation which satisfied even christina herself
who so integer vitae scelerisque purus it was asked as mr pontifex of battersby
who so fit to be consulted if any difficulty about parish management should arise
who such a happy mixture of the sincere uninquiring christian and of the man of the world
for so people actually called him
they said he was such an admirable man of business
certainly if he had said he would pay a sum of money at a certain time the money would be forthcoming on the appointed day and this is saying a good deal for any man
his constitutional timidity rendered him incapable of an attempt to overreach when there was the remotest chance of opposition or publicity and his correct bearing and somewhat stern expression were a great protection to him against being overreached
he never talked of money and invariably changed the subject whenever money was introduced
his expression of unutterable horror at all kinds of meanness was a sufficient guarantee that he was not mean himself
besides he had no business transactions save of the most ordinary butcher's book and baker's book description
his tastesif he had anywere as we have seen simple he had  pounds a year and a house the neighbourhood was cheap and for some time he had no children to be a drag upon him
who was not to be envied and if envied why then respected if theobald was not enviable
yet i imagine that christina was on the whole happier than her husband
she had not to go and visit sick parishioners and the management of her house and the keeping of her accounts afforded as much occupation as she desired
her principal duty was as she well said to her husbandto love him honour him and keep him in a good temper
to do her justice she fulfilled this duty to the uttermost of her power
it would have been better perhaps if she had not so frequently assured her husband that he was the best and wisest of mankind for no one in his little world ever dreamed of telling him anything else and it was not long before he ceased to have any doubt upon the matter
as for his temper which had become very violent at times she took care to humour it on the slightest sign of an approaching outbreak
she had early found that this was much the easiest plan
the thunder was seldom for herself
long before her marriage even she had studied his little ways and knew how to add fuel to the fire as long as the fire seemed to want it and then to damp it judiciously down making as little smoke as possible
in money matters she was scrupulousness itself
theobald made her a quarterly allowance for her dress pocket money and little charities and presents
in these last items she was liberal in proportion to her income indeed she dressed with great economy and gave away whatever was over in presents or charity
oh what a comfort it was to theobald to reflect that he had a wife on whom he could rely never to cost him a sixpence of unauthorised expenditure
letting alone her absolute submission the perfect coincidence of her opinion with his own upon every subject and her constant assurances to him that he was right in everything which he took it into his head to say or do what a tower of strength to him was her exactness in money matters
as years went by he became as fond of his wife as it was in his nature to be of any living thing and applauded himself for having stuck to his engagementa piece of virtue of which he was now reaping the reward
even when christina did outrun her quarterly stipend by some thirty shillings or a couple of pounds it was always made perfectly clear to theobald how the deficiency had arisenthere had been an unusually costly evening dress bought which was to last a long time or somebody's unexpected wedding had necessitated a more handsome present than the quarter's balance would quite allow the excess of expenditure was always repaid in the following quarter or quarters even though it were only ten shillings at a time
i believe however that after they had been married some twenty years christina had somewhat fallen from her original perfection as regards money
she had got gradually in arrear during many successive quarters till she had contracted a chronic loan a sort of domestic national debt amounting to between seven and eight pounds
theobald at length felt that a remonstrance had become imperative and took advantage of his silver wedding day to inform christina that her indebtedness was cancelled and at the same time to beg that she would endeavour henceforth to equalise her expenditure and her income
she burst into tears of love and gratitude assured him that he was the best and most generous of men and never during the remainder of her married life was she a single shilling behind hand
christina hated change of all sorts no less cordially than her husband
she and theobald had nearly everything in this world that they could wish for why then should people desire to introduce all sorts of changes of which no one could foresee the end
religion she was deeply convinced had long since attained its final development nor could it enter into the heart of reasonable man to conceive any faith more perfect than was inculcated by the church of england
she could imagine no position more honourable than that of a clergyman's wife unless indeed it were a bishop's
considering his father's influence it was not at all impossible that theobald might be a bishop some dayand thenthen would occur to her that one little flaw in the practice of the church of englanda flaw not indeed in its doctrine but in its policy which she believed on the whole to be a mistaken one in this respect
i mean the fact that a bishop's wife does not take the rank of her husband
this had been the doing of elizabeth who had been a bad woman of exceeding doubtful moral character and at heart a papist to the last
perhaps people ought to have been above mere considerations of worldly dignity but the world was as it was and such things carried weight with them whether they ought to do so or no
her influence as plain mrs pontifex wife we will say of the bishop of winchester would no doubt be considerable
such a character as hers could not fail to carry weight if she were ever in a sufficiently conspicuous sphere for its influence to be widely felt but as lady winchesteror the bishopesswhich would sound quite nicelywho could doubt that her power for good would be enhanced
and it would be all the nicer because if she had a daughter the daughter would not be a bishopess unless indeed she were to marry a bishop too which would not be likely
these were her thoughts upon her good days at other times she would to do her justice have doubts whether she was in all respects as spiritually minded as she ought to be
she must press on press on till every enemy to her salvation was surmounted and satan himself lay bruised under her feet
it occurred to her on one of these occasions that she might steal a march over some of her contemporaries if she were to leave off eating black puddings of which whenever they had killed a pig she had hitherto partaken freely and if she were also careful that no fowls were served at her table which had had their necks wrung but only such as had had their throats cut and been allowed to bleed
st paul and the church of jerusalem had insisted upon it as necessary that even gentile converts should abstain from things strangled and from blood and they had joined this prohibition with that of a vice about the abominable nature of which there could be no question it would be well therefore to abstain in future and see whether any noteworthy spiritual result ensued
she did abstain and was certain that from the day of her resolve she had felt stronger purer in heart and in all respects more spiritually minded than she had ever felt hitherto
theobald did not lay so much stress on this as she did but as she settled what he should have at dinner she could take care that he got no strangled fowls as for black puddings happily he had seen them made when he was a boy and had never got over his aversion for them
she wished the matter were one of more general observance than it was this was just a case in which as lady winchester she might have been able to do what as plain mrs pontifex it was hopeless even to attempt
and thus this worthy couple jogged on from month to month and from year to year
the reader if he has passed middle life and has a clerical connection will probably remember scores and scores of rectors and rectors' wives who differed in no material respect from theobald and christina
speaking from a recollection and experience extending over nearly eighty years from the time when i was myself a child in the nursery of a vicarage i should say i had drawn the better rather than the worse side of the life of an english country parson of some fifty years ago
i admit however that there are no such people to be found nowadays
a more united or on the whole happier couple could not have been found in england
one grief only overshadowed the early years of their married life i mean the fact that no living children were born to them
chapter xvii   in the course of time this sorrow was removed
at the beginning of the fifth year of her married life christina was safely delivered of a boy
this was on the sixth of september 
word was immediately sent to old mr pontifex who received the news with real pleasure
his son john's wife had borne daughters only and he was seriously uneasy lest there should be a failure in the male line of his descendants
the good news therefore was doubly welcome and caused as much delight at elmhurst as dismay in woburn square where the john pontifexes were then living
here indeed this freak of fortune was felt to be all the more cruel on account of the impossibility of resenting it openly but the delighted grandfather cared nothing for what the john pontifexes might feel or not feel he had wanted a grandson and he had got a grandson and this should be enough for everybody and now that mrs theobald had taken to good ways she might bring him more grandsons which would be desirable for he should not feel safe with fewer than three
he rang the bell for the butler
gelstrap he said solemnly i want to go down into the cellar
then gelstrap preceded him with a candle and he went into the inner vault where he kept his choicest wines
he passed many bins there was  port  imperial tokay  claret  sherry these and many others were passed but it was not for them that the head of the pontifex family had gone down into his inner cellar
a bin which had appeared empty until the full light of the candle had been brought to bear upon it was now found to contain a single pint bottle
this was the object of mr pontifex's search
gelstrap had often pondered over this bottle
it had been placed there by mr pontifex himself about a dozen years previously on his return from a visit to his friend the celebrated traveller dr jonesbut there was no tablet above the bin which might give a clue to the nature of its contents
on more than one occasion when his master had gone out and left his keys accidentally behind him as he sometimes did gelstrap had submitted the bottle to all the tests he could venture upon but it was so carefully sealed that wisdom remained quite shut out from that entrance at which he would have welcomed her most gladlyand indeed from all other entrances for he could make out nothing at all
and now the mystery was to be solved
but alas
it seemed as though the last chance of securing even a sip of the contents was to be removed for ever for mr pontifex took the bottle into his own hands and held it up to the light after carefully examining the seal
he smiled and left the bin with the bottle in his hands
then came a catastrophe
he stumbled over an empty hamper there was the sound of a falla smash of broken glass and in an instant the cellar floor was covered with the liquid that had been preserved so carefully for so many years
with his usual presence of mind mr pontifex gasped out a month's warning to gelstrap
then he got up and stamped as theobald had done when christina had wanted not to order his dinner
it's water from the jordan he exclaimed furiously which i have been saving for the baptism of my eldest grandson
damn you gelstrap how dare you be so infernally careless as to leave that hamper littering about the cellar
i wonder the water of the sacred stream did not stand upright as an heap upon the cellar floor and rebuke him
gelstrap told the other servants afterwards that his master's language had made his backbone curdle
the moment however that he heard the word water he saw his way again and flew to the pantry
before his master had well noted his absence he returned with a little sponge and a basin and had begun sopping up the waters of the jordan as though they had been a common slop
i'll filter it sir said gelstrap meekly
it'll come quite clean
mr pontifex saw hope in this suggestion which was shortly carried out by the help of a piece of blotting paper and a funnel under his own eyes
eventually it was found that half a pint was saved and this was held to be sufficient
then he made preparations for a visit to battersby
he ordered goodly hampers of the choicest eatables he selected a goodly hamper of choice drinkables
i say choice and not choicest for although in his first exaltation he had selected some of his very best wine yet on reflection he had felt that there was moderation in all things and as he was parting with his best water from the jordan he would only send some of his second best wine
before he went to battersby he stayed a day or two in london which he now seldom did being over seventy years old and having practically retired from business
the john pontifexes who kept a sharp eye on him discovered to their dismay that he had had an interview with his solicitors
chapter xviii   for the first time in his life theobald felt that he had done something right and could look forward to meeting his father without alarm
the old gentleman indeed had written him a most cordial letter announcing his intention of standing godfather to the boynay i may as well give it in full as it shows the writer at his best
it runs     dear theobaldyour letter gave me very sincere pleasure the more    so because i had made up my mind for the worst pray accept my most    hearty congratulations for my daughterinlaw and for yourself
i have long preserved a phial of water from the jordan for the    christening of my first grandson should it please god to grant me    one
it was given me by my old friend dr jones
you will agree with    me that though the efficacy of the sacrament does not depend upon the    source of the baptismal waters yet ceteris paribus there is a    sentiment attaching to the waters of the jordan which should not be    despised
small matters like this sometimes influence a child's whole    future career
i shall bring my own cook and have told him to get everything ready    for the christening dinner
ask as many of your best neighbours as    your table will hold
by the way i have told lesueur not to get a    lobsteryou had better drive over yourself and get one from saltness    for battersby was only fourteen or fifteen miles from the sea coast    they are better there at least i think so than anywhere else in    england
i have put your boy down for something in the event of his attaining    the age of twentyone years
if your brother john continues to have    nothing but girls i may do more later on but i have many claims upon    me and am not as well off as you may imagineyour affectionate    father     g
pontifex
a few days afterwards the writer of the above letter made his appearance in a fly which had brought him from gildenham to battersby a distance of fourteen miles
there was lesueur the cook on the box with the driver and as many hampers as the fly could carry were disposed upon the roof and elsewhere
next day the john pontifexes had to come and eliza and maria as well as alethea who by her own special request was godmother to the boy for mr pontifex had decided that they were to form a happy family party so come they all must and be happy they all must or it would be the worse for them
next day the author of all this hubbub was actually christened
theobald had proposed to call him george after old mr pontifex but strange to say mr pontifex overruled him in favour of the name ernest
the word earnest was just beginning to come into fashion and he thought the possession of such a name might like his having been baptised in water from the jordan have a permanent effect upon the boy's character and influence him for good during the more critical periods of his life
i was asked to be his second godfather and was rejoiced to have an opportunity of meeting alethea whom i had not seen for some few years but with whom i had been in constant correspondence
she and i had always been friends from the time we had played together as children onwards
when the death of her grandfather and grandmother severed her connection with paleham my intimacy with the pontifexes was kept up by my having been at school and college with theobald and each time i saw her i admired her more and more as the best kindest wittiest most lovable and to my mind handsomest woman whom i had ever seen
none of the pontifexes were deficient in good looks they were a wellgrown shapely family enough but alethea was the flower of the flock even as regards good looks while in respect of all other qualities that make a woman lovable it seemed as though the stock that had been intended for the three daughters and would have been about sufficient for them had all been allotted to herself her sisters getting none and she all
it is impossible for me to explain how it was that she and i never married
we two knew exceedingly well and that must suffice for the reader
there was the most perfect sympathy and understanding between us we knew that neither of us would marry anyone else
i had asked her to marry me a dozen times over having said this much i will say no more upon a point which is in no way necessary for the development of my story
for the last few years there had been difficulties in the way of our meeting and i had not seen her though as i have said keeping up a close correspondence with her
naturally i was overjoyed to meet her again she was now just thirty years old but i thought she looked handsomer than ever
her father of course was the lion of the party but seeing that we were all meek and quite willing to be eaten he roared to us rather than at us
it was a fine sight to see him tucking his napkin under his rosy old gills and letting it fall over his capacious waistcoat while the high light from the chandelier danced about the bump of benevolence on his bald old head like a star of bethlehem
the soup was real turtle the old gentleman was evidently well pleased and he was beginning to come out
gelstrap stood behind his master's chair
i sat next mrs theobald on her left hand and was thus just opposite her fatherinlaw whom i had every opportunity of observing
during the first ten minutes or so which were taken up with the soup and the bringing in of the fish i should probably have thought if i had not long since made up my mind about him what a fine old man he was and how proud his children should be of him but suddenly as he was helping himself to lobster sauce he flushed crimson a look of extreme vexation suffused his face and he darted two furtive but fiery glances to the two ends of the table one for theobald and one for christina
they poor simple souls of course saw that something was exceedingly wrong and so did i but i couldn't guess what it was till i heard the old man hiss in christina's ear it was not made with a hen lobster
what's the use he continued of my calling the boy ernest and getting him christened in water from the jordan if his own father does not know a cock from a hen lobster
this cut me too for i felt that till that moment i had not so much as known that there were cocks and hens among lobsters but had vaguely thought that in the matter of matrimony they were even as the angels in heaven and grew up almost spontaneously from rocks and seaweed
before the next course was over mr pontifex had recovered his temper and from that time to the end of the evening he was at his best
he told us all about the water from the jordan how it had been brought by dr jones along with some stone jars of water from the rhine the rhone the elbe and the danube and what trouble he had had with them at the custom houses and how the intention had been to make punch with waters from all the greatest rivers in europe and how he mr pontifex had saved the jordan water from going into the bowl etc etc
no no no he continued it wouldn't have done at all you know very profane idea so we each took a pint bottle of it home with us and the punch was much better without it
i had a narrow escape with mine though the other day i fell over a hamper in the cellar when i was getting it up to bring to battersby and if i had not taken the greatest care the bottle would certainly have been broken but i saved it
and gelstrap was standing behind his chair all the time
nothing more happened to ruffle mr pontifex so we had a delightful evening which has often recurred to me while watching the after career of my godson
i called a day or two afterwards and found mr pontifex still at battersby laid up with one of those attacks of liver and depression to which he was becoming more and more subject
i stayed to luncheon
the old gentleman was cross and very difficult he could eat nothinghad no appetite at all
christina tried to coax him with a little bit of the fleshy part of a mutton chop
how in the name of reason can i be asked to eat a mutton chop
he exclaimed angrily you forget my dear christina that you have to deal with a stomach that is totally disorganised and he pushed the plate from him pouting and frowning like a naughty old child
writing as i do by the light of a later knowledge i suppose i should have seen nothing in this but the world's growing pains the disturbance inseparable from transition in human things
i suppose in reality not a leaf goes yellow in autumn without ceasing to care about its sap and making the parent tree very uncomfortable by long growling and grumblingbut surely nature might find some less irritating way of carrying on business if she would give her mind to it
why should the generations overlap one another at all
why cannot we be buried as eggs in neat little cells with ten or twenty thousand pounds each wrapped round us in bank of england notes and wake up as the sphex wasp does to find that its papa and mamma have not only left ample provision at its elbow but have been eaten by sparrows some weeks before it began to live consciously on its own account
about a year and a half afterwards the tables were turned on battersbyfor mrs john pontifex was safely delivered of a boy
a year or so later still george pontifex was himself struck down suddenly by a fit of paralysis much as his mother had been but he did not see the years of his mother
when his will was opened it was found that an original bequest of  pounds to theobald himself over and above the sum that had been settled upon him and christina at the time of his marriage had been cut down to  pounds when mr pontifex left something to ernest
the something proved to be  pounds which was to accumulate in the hands of trustees
the rest of the property went to john pontifex except that each of the daughters was left with about  pounds over and above  pounds a piece which they inherited from their mother
theobald's father then had told him the truth but not the whole truth
nevertheless what right had theobald to complain
certainly it was rather hard to make him think that he and his were to be gainers and get the honour and glory of the bequest when all the time the money was virtually being taken out of theobald's own pocket
on the other hand the father doubtless argued that he had never told theobald he was to have anything at all he had a full right to do what he liked with his own money if theobald chose to indulge in unwarrantable expectations that was no affair of his as it was he was providing for him liberally and if he did take  pounds of theobald's share he was still leaving it to theobald's son which of course was much the same thing in the end
no one can deny that the testator had strict right upon his side nevertheless the reader will agree with me that theobald and christina might not have considered the christening dinner so great a success if all the facts had been before them
mr pontifex had during his own lifetime set up a monument in elmhurst church to the memory of his wife a slab with urns and cherubs like illegitimate children of king george the fourth and all the rest of it and had left space for his own epitaph underneath that of his wife
i do not know whether it was written by one of his children or whether they got some friend to write it for them
i do not believe that any satire was intended
i believe that it was the intention to convey that nothing short of the day of judgement could give anyone an idea how good a man mr pontifex had been but at first i found it hard to think that it was free from guile
the epitaph begins by giving dates of birth and death then sets out that the deceased was for many years head of the firm of fairlie and pontifex and also resident in the parish of elmhurst
there is not a syllable of either praise or dispraise
the last lines run as follows     he now lies awaiting a joyful resurrection    at the last day
what manner of man he was    that day will discover
chapter xix   this much however we may say in the meantime that having lived to be nearly seventythree years old and died rich he must have been in very fair harmony with his surroundings
i have heard it said sometimes that such and such a person's life was a lie but no man's life can be a very bad lie as long as it continues at all it is at worst ninetenths of it true
mr pontifex's life not only continued a long time but was prosperous right up to the end
is not this enough
being in this world is it not our most obvious business to make the most of itto observe what things do bona fide tend to long life and comfort and to act accordingly
all animals except man know that the principal business of life is to enjoy itand they do enjoy it as much as man and other circumstances will allow
he has spent his life best who has enjoyed it most god will take care that we do not enjoy it any more than is good for us
if mr pontifex is to be blamed it is for not having eaten and drunk less and thus suffered less from his liver and lived perhaps a year or two longer
goodness is naught unless it tends towards old age and sufficiency of means
i speak broadly and exceptis excipiendis
so the psalmist says the righteous shall not lack anything that is good
either this is mere poetical license or it follows that he who lacks anything that is good is not righteous there is a presumption also that he who has passed a long life without lacking anything that is good has himself also been good enough for practical purposes
mr pontifex never lacked anything he much cared about
true he might have been happier than he was if he had cared about things which he did not care for but the gist of this lies in the if he had cared
we have all sinned and come short of the glory of making ourselves as comfortable as we easily might have done but in this particular case mr pontifex did not care and would not have gained much by getting what he did not want
there is no casting of swine's meat before men worse than that which would flatter virtue as though her true origin were not good enough for her but she must have a lineage deduced as it were by spiritual heralds from some stock with which she has nothing to do
virtue's true lineage is older and more respectable than any that can be invented for her
she springs from man's experience concerning his own wellbeingand this though not infallible is still the least fallible thing we have
a system which cannot stand without a better foundation than this must have something so unstable within itself that it will topple over on whatever pedestal we place it
the world has long ago settled that morality and virtue are what bring men peace at the last
be virtuous says the copybook and you will be happy
surely if a reputed virtue fails often in this respect it is only an insidious form of vice and if a reputed vice brings no very serious mischief on a man's later years it is not so bad a vice as it is said to be
unfortunately though we are all of a mind about the main opinion that virtue is what tends to happiness and vice what ends in sorrow we are not so unanimous about detailsthat is to say as to whether any given course such we will say as smoking has a tendency to happiness or the reverse
i submit it as the result of my own poor observation that a good deal of unkindness and selfishness on the part of parents towards children is not generally followed by ill consequences to the parents themselves
they may cast a gloom over their children's lives for many years without having to suffer anything that will hurt them
i should say then that it shows no great moral obliquity on the part of parents if within certain limits they make their children's lives a burden to them
granted that mr pontifex's was not a very exalted character ordinary men are not required to have very exalted characters
it is enough if we are of the same moral and mental stature as the main or mean part of menthat is to say as the average
it is involved in the very essence of things that rich men who die old shall have been mean
the greatest and wisest of mankind will be almost always found to be the meanestthe ones who have kept the mean best between excess either of virtue or vice
they hardly ever have been prosperous if they have not done this and considering how many miscarry altogether it is no small feather in a man's cap if he has been no worse than his neighbours
homer tells us about some one who made it his business greek textalways to excel and to stand higher than other people
what an uncompanionable disagreeable person he must have been
homer's heroes generally came to a bad end and i doubt not that this gentleman whoever he was did so sooner or later
a very high standard again involves the possession of rare virtues and rare virtues are like rare plants or animals things that have not been able to hold their own in the world
a virtue to be serviceable must like gold be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal
people divide off vice and virtue as though they were two things neither of which had with it anything of the other
this is not so
there is no useful virtue which has not some alloy of vice and hardly any vice if any which carries not with it a little dash of virtue virtue and vice are like life and death or mind and matterthings which cannot exist without being qualified by their opposite
the most absolute life contains death and the corpse is still in many respects living so also it has been said if thou lord wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss which shows that even the highest ideal we can conceive will yet admit so much compromise with vice as shall countenance the poor abuses of the time if they are not too outrageous
that vice pays homage to virtue is notorious we call this hypocrisy there should be a word found for the homage which virtue not unfrequently pays or at any rate would be wise in paying to vice
i grant that some men will find happiness in having what we all feel to be a higher moral standard than others
if they go in for this however they must be content with virtue as her own reward and not grumble if they find lofty quixotism an expensive luxury whose rewards belong to a kingdom that is not of this world
they must not wonder if they cut a poor figure in trying to make the most of both worlds
disbelieve as we may the details of the accounts which record the growth of the christian religion yet a great part of christian teaching will remain as true as though we accepted the details
we cannot serve god and mammon strait is the way and narrow is the gate which leads to what those who live by faith hold to be best worth having and there is no way of saying this better than the bible has done
it is well there should be some who think thus as it is well there should be speculators in commerce who will often burn their fingersbut it is not well that the majority should leave the mean and beaten path
for most men and most circumstances pleasuretangible material prosperity in this worldis the safest test of virtue
progress has ever been through the pleasures rather than through the extreme sharp virtues and the most virtuous have leaned to excess rather than to asceticism
to use a commercial metaphor competition is so keen and the margin of profits has been cut down so closely that virtue cannot afford to throw any bona fide chance away and must base her action rather on the actual moneying out of conduct than on a flattering prospectus
she will not therefore neglectas some do who are prudent and economical enough in other mattersthe important factor of our chance of escaping detection or at any rate of our dying first
a reasonable virtue will give this chance its due value neither more nor less
pleasure after all is a safer guide than either right or duty
for hard as it is to know what gives us pleasure right and duty are often still harder to distinguish and if we go wrong with them will lead us into just as sorry a plight as a mistaken opinion concerning pleasure
when men burn their fingers through following after pleasure they find out their mistake and get to see where they have gone wrong more easily than when they have burnt them through following after a fancied duty or a fancied idea concerning right virtue
the devil in fact when he dresses himself in angel's clothes can only be detected by experts of exceptional skill and so often does he adopt this disguise that it is hardly safe to be seen talking to an angel at all and prudent people will follow after pleasure as a more homely but more respectable and on the whole much more trustworthy guide
returning to mr pontifex over and above his having lived long and prosperously he left numerous offspring to all of whom he communicated not only his physical and mental characteristics with no more than the usual amount of modification but also no small share of characteristics which are less easily transmittedi mean his pecuniary characteristics
it may be said that he acquired these by sitting still and letting money run as it were right up against him but against how many does not money run who do not take it when it does or who even if they hold it for a little while cannot so incorporate it with themselves that it shall descend through them to their offspring
mr pontifex did this
he kept what he may be said to have made and money is like a reputation for abilitymore easily made than kept
take him then for all in all i am not inclined to be so severe upon him as my father was
judge him according to any very lofty standard and he is nowhere
judge him according to a fair average standard and there is not much fault to be found with him
i have said what i have said in the foregoing chapter once for all and shall not break my thread to repeat it
it should go without saying in modification of the verdict which the reader may be inclined to pass too hastily not only upon mr george pontifex but also upon theobald and christina
and now i will continue my story
chapter xx   the birth of his son opened theobald's eyes to a good deal which he had but faintly realised hitherto
he had had no idea how great a nuisance a baby was
babies come into the world so suddenly at the end and upset everything so terribly when they do come why cannot they steal in upon us with less of a shock to the domestic system
his wife too did not recover rapidly from her confinement she remained an invalid for months here was another nuisance and an expensive one which interfered with the amount which theobald liked to put by out of his income against as he said a rainy day or to make provision for his family if he should have one
now he was getting a family so that it became all the more necessary to put money by and here was the baby hindering him
theorists may say what they like about a man's children being a continuation of his own identity but it will generally be found that those who talk in this way have no children of their own
practical family men know better
about twelve months after the birth of ernest there came a second also a boy who was christened joseph and in less than twelve months afterwards a girl to whom was given the name of charlotte
a few months before this girl was born christina paid a visit to the john pontifexes in london and knowing her condition passed a good deal of time at the royal academy exhibition looking at the types of female beauty portrayed by the academicians for she had made up her mind that the child this time was to be a girl
alethea warned her not to do this but she persisted and certainly the child turned out plain but whether the pictures caused this or no i cannot say
theobald had never liked children
he had always got away from them as soon as he could and so had they from him oh why he was inclined to ask himself could not children be born into the world grown up
if christina could have given birth to a few fullgrown clergymen in priest's ordersof moderate views but inclining rather to evangelicalism with comfortable livings and in all respects facsimiles of theobald himselfwhy there might have been more sense in it or if people could buy readymade children at a shop of whatever age and sex they liked instead of always having to make them at home and to begin at the beginning with themthat might do better but as it was he did not like it
he felt as he had felt when he had been required to come and be married to christinathat he had been going on for a long time quite nicely and would much rather continue things on their present footing
in the matter of getting married he had been obliged to pretend he liked it but times were changed and if he did not like a thing now he could find a hundred unexceptionable ways of making his dislike apparent
it might have been better if theobald in his younger days had kicked more against his father the fact that he had not done so encouraged him to expect the most implicit obedience from his own children
he could trust himself he said and so did christina to be more lenient than perhaps his father had been to himself his danger he said and so again did christina would be rather in the direction of being too indulgent he must be on his guard against this for no duty could be more important than that of teaching a child to obey its parents in all things
he had read not long since of an eastern traveller who while exploring somewhere in the more remote parts of arabia and asia minor had come upon a remarkably hardy sober industrious little christian communityall of them in the best of healthwho had turned out to be the actual living descendants of jonadab the son of rechab and two men in european costume indeed but speaking english with a broken accent and by their colour evidently oriental had come begging to battersby soon afterwards and represented themselves as belonging to this people they had said they were collecting funds to promote the conversion of their fellow tribesmen to the english branch of the christian religion
true they turned out to be impostors for when he gave them a pound and christina five shillings from her private purse they went and got drunk with it in the next village but one to battersby still this did not invalidate the story of the eastern traveller
then there were the romanswhose greatness was probably due to the wholesome authority exercised by the head of a family over all its members
some romans had even killed their children this was going too far but then the romans were not christians and knew no better
the practical outcome of the foregoing was a conviction in theobald's mind and if in his then in christina's that it was their duty to begin training up their children in the way they should go even from their earliest infancy
the first signs of selfwill must be carefully looked for and plucked up by the roots at once before they had time to grow
theobald picked up this numb serpent of a metaphor and cherished it in his bosom
before ernest could well crawl he was taught to kneel before he could well speak he was taught to lisp the lord's prayer and the general confession
how was it possible that these things could be taught too early
if his attention flagged or his memory failed him here was an ill weed which would grow apace unless it were plucked out immediately and the only way to pluck it out was to whip him or shut him up in a cupboard or dock him of some of the small pleasures of childhood
before he was three years old he could read and after a fashion write
before he was four he was learning latin and could do rule of three sums
as for the child himself he was naturally of an even temper he doted upon his nurse on kittens and puppies and on all things that would do him the kindness of allowing him to be fond of them
he was fond of his mother too but as regards his father he has told me in later life he could remember no feeling but fear and shrinking
christina did not remonstrate with theobald concerning the severity of the tasks imposed upon their boy nor yet as to the continual whippings that were found necessary at lesson times
indeed when during any absence of theobald's the lessons were entrusted to her she found to her sorrow that it was the only thing to do and she did it no less effectually than theobald himself nevertheless she was fond of her boy which theobald never was and it was long before she could destroy all affection for herself in the mind of her firstborn
but she persevered
chapter xxi   strange
for she believed she doted upon him and certainly she loved him better than either of her other children
her version of the matter was that there had never yet been two parents so selfdenying and devoted to the highest welfare of their children as theobald and herself
for ernest a very great futureshe was certain of itwas in store
this made severity all the more necessary so that from the first he might have been kept pure from every taint of evil
she could not allow herself the scope for castle building which we read was indulged in by every jewish matron before the appearance of the messiah for the messiah had now come but there was to be a millennium shortly certainly not later than  when ernest would be just about the right age for it and a modern elias would be wanted to herald its approach
heaven would bear her witness that she had never shrunk from the idea of martyrdom for herself and theobald nor would she avoid it for her boy if his life was required of her in her redeemer's service
oh no
if god told her to offer up her firstborn as he had told abraham she would take him up to pigbury beacon and plunge theno that she could not do but it would be unnecessarysome one else might do that
it was not for nothing that ernest had been baptised in water from the jordan
it had not been her doing nor yet theobald's
they had not sought it
when water from the sacred stream was wanted for a sacred infant the channel had been found through which it was to flow from far palestine over land and sea to the door of the house where the child was lying
why it was a miracle
it was
it was
she saw it all now
the jordan had left its bed and flowed into her own house
it was idle to say that this was not a miracle
no miracle was effected without means of some kind the difference between the faithful and the unbeliever consisted in the very fact that the former could see a miracle where the latter could not
the jews could see no miracle even in the raising of lazarus and the feeding of the five thousand
the john pontifexes would see no miracle in this matter of the water from the jordan
the essence of a miracle lay not in the fact that means had been dispensed with but in the adoption of means to a great end that had not been available without interference and no one would suppose that dr jones would have brought the water unless he had been directed
she would tell this to theobald and get him to see it in the 
  and yet perhaps it would be better not
the insight of women upon matters of this sort was deeper and more unerring than that of men
it was a woman and not a man who had been filled most completely with the whole fulness of the deity
but why had they not treasured up the water after it was used
it ought never never to have been thrown away but it had been
perhaps however this was for the best toothey might have been tempted to set too much store by it and it might have become a source of spiritual danger to themperhaps even of spiritual pride the very sin of all others which she most abhorred
as for the channel through which the jordan had flowed to battersby that mattered not more than the earth through which the river ran in palestine itself
dr jones was certainly worldlyvery worldly so she regretted to feel had been her fatherinlaw though in a less degree spiritual at heart doubtless and becoming more and more spiritual continually as he grew older still he was tainted with the world till a very few hours probably before his death whereas she and theobald had given up all for christ's sake
they were not worldly
at least theobald was not
she had been but she was sure she had grown in grace since she had left off eating things strangled and bloodthis was as the washing in jordan as against abana and pharpar rivers of damascus
her boy should never touch a strangled fowl nor a black puddingthat at any rate she could see to
he should have a coral from the neighbourhood of joppathere were coral insects on those coasts so that the thing could easily be done with a little energy she would write to dr jones about it etc
and so on for hours together day after day for years
truly mrs theobald loved her child according to her lights with an exceeding great fondness but the dreams she had dreamed in sleep were sober realities in comparison with those she indulged in while awake
when ernest was in his second year theobald as i have already said began to teach him to read
he began to whip him two days after he had begun to teach him
it was painful as he said to christina but it was the only thing to do and it was done
the child was puny white and sickly so they sent continually for the doctor who dosed him with calomel and james's powder
all was done in love anxiety timidity stupidity and impatience
they were stupid in little things and he that is stupid in little will be stupid also in much
presently old mr pontifex died and then came the revelation of the little alteration he had made in his will simultaneously with his bequest to ernest
it was rather hard to bear especially as there was no way of conveying a bit of their minds to the testator now that he could no longer hurt them
as regards the boy himself anyone must see that the bequest would be an unmitigated misfortune to him
to leave him a small independence was perhaps the greatest injury which one could inflict upon a young man
it would cripple his energies and deaden his desire for active employment
many a youth was led into evil courses by the knowledge that on arriving at majority he would come into a few thousands
they might surely have been trusted to have their boy's interests at heart and must be better judges of those interests than he at twentyone could be expected to be besides if jonadab the son of rechab's fatheror perhaps it might be simpler under the circumstances to say rechab at onceif rechab then had left handsome legacies to his grandchildrenwhy jonadab might not have found those children so easy to deal with etc
my dear said theobald after having discussed the matter with christina for the twentieth time my dear the only thing to guide and console us under misfortunes of this kind is to take refuge in practical work
i will go and pay a visit to mrs thompson
on those days mrs thompson would be told that her sins were all washed white etc a little sooner and a little more peremptorily than on others
chapter xxii   i used to stay at battersby for a day or two sometimes while my godson and his brother and sister were children
i hardly know why i went for theobald and i grew more and more apart but one gets into grooves sometimes and the supposed friendship between myself and the pontifexes continued to exist though it was now little more than rudimentary
my godson pleased me more than either of the other children but he had not much of the buoyancy of childhood and was more like a puny sallow little old man than i liked
the young people however were very ready to be friendly
i remember ernest and his brother hovered round me on the first day of one of these visits with their hands full of fading flowers which they at length proffered me
on this i did what i suppose was expected i inquired if there was a shop near where they could buy sweeties
they said there was so i felt in my pockets but only succeeded in finding two pence halfpenny in small money
this i gave them and the youngsters aged four and three toddled off alone
ere long they returned and ernest said we can't get sweeties for all this money i felt rebuked but no rebuke was intended we can get sweeties for this showing a penny and for this showing another penny but we cannot get them for all this and he added the halfpenny to the two pence
i suppose they had wanted a twopenny cake or something like that
i was amused and left them to solve the difficulty their own way being anxious to see what they would do
presently ernest said may we give you back this showing the halfpenny and not give you back this and this
showing the pence
i assented and they gave a sigh of relief and went on their way rejoicing
a few more presents of pence and small toys completed the conquest and they began to take me into their confidence
they told me a good deal which i am afraid i ought not to have listened to
they said that if grandpapa had lived longer he would most likely have been made a lord and that then papa would have been the honourable and reverend but that grandpapa was now in heaven singing beautiful hymns with grandmamma allaby to jesus christ who was very fond of them and that when ernest was ill his mamma had told him he need not be afraid of dying for he would go straight to heaven if he would only be sorry for having done his lessons so badly and vexed his dear papa and if he would promise never never to vex him any more and that when he got to heaven grandpapa and grandmamma allaby would meet him and he would be always with them and they would be very good to him and teach him to sing ever such beautiful hymns more beautiful by far than those which he was now so fond of etc etc
 but he did not wish to die and was glad when he got better for there were no kittens in heaven and he did not think there were cowslips to make cowslip tea with
their mother was plainly disappointed in them
my children are none of them geniuses mr overton she said to me at breakfast one morning
they have fair abilities and thanks to theobald's tuition they are forward for their years but they have nothing like genius genius is a thing apart from this is it not
of course i said it was a thing quite apart from this but if my thoughts had been laid bare they would have appeared as give me my coffee immediately ma'am and don't talk nonsense
i have no idea what genius is but so far as i can form any conception about it i should say it was a stupid word which cannot be too soon abandoned to scientific and literary claqueurs
i do not know exactly what christina expected but i should imagine it was something like this my children ought to be all geniuses because they are mine and theobald's and it is naughty of them not to be but of course they cannot be so good and clever as theobald and i were and if they show signs of being so it will be naughty of them
happily however they are not this and yet it is very dreadful that they are not
as for geniushoitytoity indeedwhy a genius should turn intellectual summersaults as soon as it is born and none of my children have yet been able to get into the newspapers
i will not have children of mine give themselves airsit is enough for them that theobald and i should do so
she did not know poor woman that the true greatness wears an invisible cloak under cover of which it goes in and out among men without being suspected if its cloak does not conceal it from itself always and from all others for many years its greatness will ere long shrink to very ordinary dimensions
what then it may be asked is the good of being great
the answer is that you may understand greatness better in others whether alive or dead and choose better company from these and enjoy and understand that company better when you have chosen italso that you may be able to give pleasure to the best people and live in the lives of those who are yet unborn
this one would think was substantial gain enough for greatness without its wanting to ride roughshod over us even when disguised as humility
i was there on a sunday and observed the rigour with which the young people were taught to observe the sabbath they might not cut out things nor use their paintbox on a sunday and this they thought rather hard because their cousins the john pontifexes might do these things
their cousins might play with their toy train on sunday but though they had promised that they would run none but sunday trains all traffic had been prohibited
one treat only was allowed themon sunday evenings they might choose their own hymns
in the course of the evening they came into the drawingroom and as an especial treat were to sing some of their hymns to me instead of saying them so that i might hear how nicely they sang
ernest was to choose the first hymn and he chose one about some people who were to come to the sunset tree
i am no botanist and do not know what kind of tree a sunset tree is but the words began come come come come to the sunset tree for the day is past and gone
the tune was rather pretty and had taken ernest's fancy for he was unusually fond of music and had a sweet little child's voice which he liked using
he was however very late in being able to sound a hard it c or k and instead of saying come he said tum tum tum
ernest said theobald from the armchair in front of the fire where he was sitting with his hands folded before him don't you think it would be very nice if you were to say 'come' like other people instead of 'tum'
i do say tum replied ernest meaning that he had said come
theobald was always in a bad temper on sunday evening
whether it is that they are as much bored with the day as their neighbours or whether they are tired or whatever the cause may be clergymen are seldom at their best on sunday evening i had already seen signs that evening that my host was cross and was a little nervous at hearing ernest say so promptly i do say tum when his papa had said he did not say it as he should
theobald noticed the fact that he was being contradicted in a moment
he got up from his armchair and went to the piano
no ernest you don't he said you say nothing of the kind you say 'tum' not 'come'
now say 'come' after me as i do
tum said ernest at once is that better
i have no doubt he thought it was but it was not
now ernest you are not taking pains you are not trying as you ought to do
it is high time you learned to say 'come' why joey can say 'come' can't you joey
yeth i can replied joey and he said something which was not far off come
there ernest do you hear that
there's no difficulty about it nor shadow of difficulty
now take your own time think about it and say 'come' after me
the boy remained silent a few seconds and then said tum again
i laughed but theobald turned to me impatiently and said please do not laugh overton it will make the boy think it does not matter and it matters a great deal then turning to ernest he said now ernest i will give you one more chance and if you don't say 'come' i shall know that you are selfwilled and naughty
he looked very angry and a shade came over ernest's face like that which comes upon the face of a puppy when it is being scolded without understanding why
the child saw well what was coming now was frightened and of course said tum once more
very well ernest said his father catching him angrily by the shoulder
i have done my best to save you but if you will have it so you will and he lugged the little wretch crying by anticipation out of the room
a few minutes more and we could hear screams coming from the diningroom across the hall which separated the drawingroom from the diningroom and knew that poor ernest was being beaten
i have sent him up to bed said theobald as he returned to the drawing room and now christina i think we will have the servants in to prayers and he rang the bell for them redhanded as he was
chapter xxiii   the manservant william came and set the chairs for the maids and presently they filed in
first christina's maid then the cook then the housemaid then william and then the coachman
i sat opposite them and watched their faces as theobald read a chapter from the bible
they were nice people but more absolute vacancy i never saw upon the countenances of human beings
theobald began by reading a few verses from the old testament according to some system of his own
on this occasion the passage came from the fifteenth chapter of numbers it had no particular bearing that i could see upon anything which was going on just then but the spirit which breathed throughout the whole seemed to me to be so like that of theobald himself that i could understand better after hearing it how he came to think as he thought and act as he acted
the verses are as follows     but the soul that doeth aught presumptuously whether he be born in    the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that soul    shall be cut off from among his people
because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his    commandments that soul shall be utterly cut off his iniquity shall    be upon him
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a    man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and    aaron and unto all the congregation
and they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be    done to him
and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to death    all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp
and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him    with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying     speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them    fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations    and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and    remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye    seek not after your own heart and your own eyes
that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your    god
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt to    be your god i am the lord your god
my thoughts wandered while theobald was reading the above and reverted to a little matter which i had observed in the course of the afternoon
it happened that some years previously a swarm of bees had taken up their abode in the roof of the house under the slates and had multiplied so that the drawingroom was a good deal frequented by these bees during the summer when the windows were open
the drawingroom paper was of a pattern which consisted of bunches of red and white roses and i saw several bees at different times fly up to these bunches and try them under the impression that they were real flowers having tried one bunch they tried the next and the next and the next till they reached the one that was nearest the ceiling then they went down bunch by bunch as they had ascended till they were stopped by the back of the sofa on this they ascended bunch by bunch to the ceiling again and so on and so on till i was tired of watching them
as i thought of the family prayers being repeated night and morning week by week month by month and year by year i could nor help thinking how like it was to the way in which the bees went up the wall and down the wall bunch by bunch without ever suspecting that so many of the associated ideas could be present and yet the main idea be wanting hopelessly and for ever
when theobald had finished reading we all knelt down and the carlo dolci and the sassoferrato looked down upon a sea of upturned backs as we buried our faces in our chairs
i noted that theobald prayed that we might be made truly honest and conscientious in all our dealings and smiled at the introduction of the truly
then my thoughts ran back to the bees and i reflected that after all it was perhaps as well at any rate for theobald that our prayers were seldom marked by any very encouraging degree of response for if i had thought there was the slightest chance of my being heard i should have prayed that some one might ere long treat him as he had treated ernest
then my thoughts wandered on to those calculations which people make about waste of time and how much one can get done if one gives ten minutes a day to it and i was thinking what improper suggestion i could make in connection with this and the time spent on family prayers which should at the same time be just tolerable when i heard theobald beginning the grace of our lord jesus christ and in a few seconds the ceremony was over and the servants filed out again as they had filed in
as soon as they had left the drawingroom christina who was a little ashamed of the transaction to which i had been a witness imprudently returned to it and began to justify it saying that it cut her to the heart and that it cut theobald to the heart and a good deal more but that it was the only thing to be done
i received this as coldly as i decently could and by my silence during the rest of the evening showed that i disapproved of what i had seen
next day i was to go back to london but before i went i said i should like to take some newlaid eggs back with me so theobald took me to the house of a labourer in the village who lived a stone's throw from the rectory as being likely to supply me with them
ernest for some reason or other was allowed to come too
i think the hens had begun to sit but at any rate eggs were scarce and the cottager's wife could not find me more than seven or eight which we proceeded to wrap up in separate pieces of paper so that i might take them to town safely
this operation was carried on upon the ground in front of the cottage door and while we were in the midst of it the cottager's little boy a lad much about ernest's age trod upon one of the eggs that was wrapped up in paper and broke it
there now jack said his mother see what you've done you've broken a nice egg and cost me a pennyhere emma she added calling her daughter take the child away there's a dear
emma came at once and walked off with the youngster taking him out of harm's way
papa said ernest after we had left the house why didn't mrs heaton whip jack when he trod on the egg
i was spiteful enough to give theobald a grim smile which said as plainly as words could have done that i thought ernest had hit him rather hard
theobald coloured and looked angry
i dare say he said quickly that his mother will whip him now that we are gone
i was not going to have this and said i did not believe it and so the matter dropped but theobald did not forget it and my visits to battersby were henceforth less frequent
on our return to the house we found the postman had arrived and had brought a letter appointing theobald to a rural deanery which had lately fallen vacant by the death of one of the neighbouring clergy who had held the office for many years
the bishop wrote to theobald most warmly and assured him that he valued him as among the most hardworking and devoted of his parochial clergy
christina of course was delighted and gave me to understand that it was only an instalment of the much higher dignities which were in store for theobald when his merits were more widely known
i did not then foresee how closely my godson's life and mine were in after years to be bound up together if i had i should doubtless have looked upon him with different eyes and noted much to which i paid no attention at the time
as it was i was glad to get away from him for i could do nothing for him or chose to say that i could not and the sight of so much suffering was painful to me
a man should not only have his own way as far as possible but he should only consort with things that are getting their own way so far that they are at any rate comfortable
unless for short times under exceptional circumstances he should not even see things that have been stunted or starved much less should he eat meat that has been vexed by having been overdriven or underfed or afflicted with any disease nor should he touch vegetables that have not been well grown
for all these things cross a man whatever a man comes in contact with in any way forms a cross with him which will leave him better or worse and the better things he is crossed with the more likely he is to live long and happily
all things must be crossed a little or they would cease to livebut holy things such for example as giovanni bellini's saints have been crossed with nothing but what is good of its kind     chapter xxiv   the storm which i have described in the previous chapter was a sample of those that occurred daily for many years
no matter how clear the sky it was always liable to cloud over now in one quarter now in another and the thunder and lightning were upon the young people before they knew where they were
and then you know said ernest to me when i asked him not long since to give me more of his childish reminiscences for the benefit of my story we used to learn mrs barbauld's hymns they were in prose and there was one about the lion which began 'come and i will show you what is strong
the lion is strong when he raiseth himself from his lair when he shaketh his mane when the voice of his roaring is heard the cattle of the field fly and the beasts of the desert hide themselves for he is very terrible'
i used to say this to joey and charlotte about my father himself when i got a little older but they were always didactic and said it was naughty of me
one great reason why clergymen's households are generally unhappy is because the clergyman is so much at home or close about the house
the doctor is out visiting patients half his time the lawyer and the merchant have offices away from home but the clergyman has no official place of business which shall ensure his being away from home for many hours together at stated times
our great days were when my father went for a day's shopping to gildenham
we were some miles from this place and commissions used to accumulate on my father's list till he would make a day of it and go and do the lot
as soon as his back was turned the air felt lighter as soon as the hall door opened to let him in again the law with its allreaching 'touch not taste not handle not' was upon us again
the worst of it was that i could never trust joey and charlotte they would go a good way with me and then turn back or even the whole way and then their consciences would compel them to tell papa and mamma
they liked running with the hare up to a certain point but their instinct was towards the hounds
it seems to me he continued that the family is a survival of the principle which is more logically embodied in the compound animaland the compound animal is a form of life which has been found incompatible with high development
i would do with the family among mankind what nature has done with the compound animal and confine it to the lower and less progressive races
certainly there is no inherent love for the family system on the part of nature herself
poll the forms of life and you will find it in a ridiculously small minority
the fishes know it not and they get along quite nicely
the ants and the bees who far outnumber man sting their fathers to death as a matter of course and are given to the atrocious mutilation of ninetenths of the offspring committed to their charge yet where shall we find communities more universally respected
take the cuckoo againis there any bird which we like better
i saw he was running off from his own reminiscences and tried to bring him back to them but it was no use
what a fool he said a man is to remember anything that happened more than a week ago unless it was pleasant or unless he wants to make some use of it
sensible people get the greater part of their own dying done during their own lifetime
a man at five and thirty should no more regret not having had a happier childhood than he should regret not having been born a prince of the blood
he might be happier if he had been more fortunate in childhood but for aught he knows if he had something else might have happened which might have killed him long ago
if i had to be born again i would be born at battersby of the same father and mother as before and i would not alter anything that has ever happened to me
the most amusing incident that i can remember about his childhood was that when he was about seven years old he told me he was going to have a natural child
i asked him his reasons for thinking this and he explained that papa and mamma had always told him that nobody had children till they were married and as long as he had believed this of course he had had no idea of having a child till he was grown up but not long since he had been reading mrs markham's history of england and had come upon the words john of gaunt had several natural children he had therefore asked his governess what a natural child waswere not all children natural
oh my dear said she a natural child is a child a person has before he is married
on this it seemed to follow logically that if john of gaunt had had children before he was married he ernest pontifex might have them also and he would be obliged to me if i would tell him what he had better do under the circumstances
i enquired how long ago he had made this discovery
he said about a fortnight and he did not know where to look for the child for it might come at any moment
you know he said babies come so suddenly one goes to bed one night and next morning there is a baby
why it might die of cold if we are not on the lookout for it
i hope it will be a boy
and you have told your governess about this
yes but she puts me off and does not help me she says it will not come for many years and she hopes not then
are you quite sure that you have not made any mistake in all this
oh no because mrs burne you know called here a few days ago and i was sent for to be looked at
and mamma held me out at arm's length and said 'is he mr pontifex's child mrs burne or is he mine'
of course she couldn't have said this if papa had not had some of the children himself
i did think the gentleman had all the boys and the lady all the girls but it can't be like this or else mamma would not have asked mrs burne to guess but then mrs burne said 'oh he's mr pontifex's child of course' and i didn't quite know what she meant by saying 'of course' it seemed as though i was right in thinking that the husband has all the boys and the wife all the girls i wish you would explain to me all about it
this i could hardly do so i changed the conversation after reassuring him as best i could
chapter xxv   three or four years after the birth of her daughter christina had had one more child
she had never been strong since she married and had a presentiment that she should not survive this last confinement
she accordingly wrote the following letter which was to be given as she endorsed upon it to her sons when ernest was sixteen years old
it reached him on his mother's death many years later for it was the baby who died now and not christina
it was found among papers which she had repeatedly and carefully arranged with the seal already broken
this i am afraid shows that christina had read it and thought it too creditable to be destroyed when the occasion that had called it forth had gone by
it is as follows     battersby march th 
my two dear boyswhen this is put into your hands will you try to    bring to mind the mother whom you lost in your childhood and whom i    fear you will almost have forgotten
you ernest will remember her    best for you are past five years old and the many many times that    she has taught you your prayers and hymns and sums and told you    stories and our happy sunday evenings will not quite have passed from    your mind and you joey though only four will perhaps recollect    some of these things
my dear dear boys for the sake of that mother    who loved you very dearlyand for the sake of your own happiness for    ever and everattend to and try to remember and from time to time    read over again the last words she can ever speak to you
when i    think about leaving you all two things press heavily upon me one    your father's sorrow for you my darlings after missing me a little    while will soon forget your loss the other the everlasting welfare    of my children
i know how long and deep the former will be and i    know that he will look to his children to be almost his only earthly    comfort
you know for i am certain that it will have been so how    he has devoted his life to you and taught you and laboured to lead you    to all that is right and good
oh then be sure that you are his    comforts
let him find you obedient affectionate and attentive to    his wishes upright selfdenying and diligent let him never blush    for or grieve over the sins and follies of those who owe him such a    debt of gratitude and whose first duty it is to study his happiness
you have both of you a name which must not be disgraced a father and    a grandfather of whom to show yourselves worthy your respectability    and welldoing in life rest mainly with yourselves but far far    beyond earthly respectability and welldoing and compared with which    they are as nothing your eternal happiness rests with yourselves
you    know your duty but snares and temptations from without beset you and    the nearer you approach to manhood the more strongly will you feel    this
with god's help with god's word and with humble hearts you    will stand in spite of everything but should you leave off seeking in    earnest for the first and applying to the second should you learn to    trust in yourselves or to the advice and example of too many around    you you will you must fall
oh 'let god be true and every man a    liar'
he says you cannot serve him and mammon
he says that strait    is the gate that leads to eternal life
many there are who seek to    widen it they will tell you that such and such selfindulgences are    but venial offencesthat this and that worldly compliance is    excusable and even necessary
the thing cannot be for in a hundred    and a hundred places he tells you solook to your bibles and seek    there whether such counsel is trueand if not oh 'halt not between    two opinions' if god is the lord follow him only be strong and of a    good courage and he will never leave you nor forsake you
remember    there is not in the bible one law for the rich and one for the    poorone for the educated and one for the ignorant
to all there    is but one thing needful
all are to be living to god and their    fellowcreatures and not to themselves
all must seek first the    kingdom of god and his righteousnessmust deny themselves be pure    and chaste and charitable in the fullest and widest senseall    'forgetting those things that are behind' must 'press forward towards    the mark for the prize of the high calling of god'
and now i will add but two things more
be true through life to each    other love as only brothers should do strengthen warn encourage    one another and let who will be against you let each feel that in    his brother he has a firm and faithful friend who will be so to the    end and oh
be kind and watchful over your dear sister without    mother or sisters she will doubly need her brothers' love and    tenderness and confidence
i am certain she will seek them and will    love you and try to make you happy be sure then that you do not fail    her and remember that were she to lose her father and remain    unmarried she would doubly need protectors
to you then i    especially commend her
oh
my three darling children be true to    each other your father and your god
may he guide and bless you    and grant that in a better and happier world i and mine may meet    againyour most affectionate mother     christina pontifex
from enquiries i have made i have satisfied myself that most mothers write letters like this shortly before their confinements and that fifty per cent
keep them afterwards as christina did
chapter xxvi   the foregoing letter shows how much greater was christina's anxiety for the eternal than for the temporal welfare of her sons
one would have thought she had sowed enough of such religious wild oats by this time but she had plenty still to sow
to me it seems that those who are happy in this world are better and more lovable people than those who are not and that thus in the event of a resurrection and day of judgement they will be the most likely to be deemed worthy of a heavenly mansion
perhaps a dim unconscious perception of this was the reason why christina was so anxious for theobald's earthly happiness or was it merely due to a conviction that his eternal welfare was so much a matter of course that it only remained to secure his earthly happiness
he was to find his sons obedient affectionate attentive to his wishes selfdenying and diligent a goodly string forsooth of all the virtues most convenient to parents he was never to have to blush for the follies of those who owed him such a debt of gratitude and whose first duty it was to study his happiness
how like maternal solicitude is this
solicitude for the most part lest the offspring should come to have wishes and feelings of its own which may occasion many difficulties fancied or real
it is this that is at the bottom of the whole mischief but whether this last proposition is granted or no at any rate we observe that christina had a sufficiently keen appreciation of the duties of children towards their parents and felt the task of fulfilling them adequately to be so difficult that she was very doubtful how far ernest and joey would succeed in mastering it
it is plain in fact that her supposed parting glance upon them was one of suspicion
but there was no suspicion of theobald that he should have devoted his life to his childrenwhy this was such a mere platitude as almost to go without saying
how let me ask was it possible that a child only a little past five years old trained in such an atmosphere of prayers and hymns and sums and happy sunday eveningsto say nothing of daily repeated beatings over the said prayers and hymns etc about which our authoress is silenthow was it possible that a lad so trained should grow up in any healthy or vigorous development even though in her own way his mother was undoubtedly very fond of him and sometimes told him stories
can the eye of any reader fail to detect the coming wrath of god as about to descend upon the head of him who should be nurtured under the shadow of such a letter as the foregoing
i have often thought that the church of rome does wisely in not allowing her priests to marry
certainly it is a matter of common observation in england that the sons of clergymen are frequently unsatisfactory
the explanation is very simple but is so often lost sight of that i may perhaps be pardoned for giving it here
the clergyman is expected to be a kind of human sunday
things must not be done in him which are venial in the weekday classes
he is paid for this business of leading a stricter life than other people
it is his raison d'etre
if his parishioners feel that he does this they approve of him for they look upon him as their own contribution towards what they deem a holy life
this is why the clergyman is so often called a vicarhe being the person whose vicarious goodness is to stand for that of those entrusted to his charge
but his home is his castle as much as that of any other englishman and with him as with others unnatural tension in public is followed by exhaustion when tension is no longer necessary
his children are the most defenceless things he can reach and it is on them in nine cases out of ten that he will relieve his mind
a clergyman again can hardly ever allow himself to look facts fairly in the face
it is his profession to support one side it is impossible therefore for him to make an unbiassed examination of the other
we forget that every clergyman with a living or curacy is as much a paid advocate as the barrister who is trying to persuade a jury to acquit a prisoner
we should listen to him with the same suspense of judgment the same full consideration of the arguments of the opposing counsel as a judge does when he is trying a case
unless we know these and can state them in a way that our opponents would admit to be a fair representation of their views we have no right to claim that we have formed an opinion at all
the misfortune is that by the law of the land one side only can be heard
theobald and christina were no exceptions to the general rule
when they came to battersby they had every desire to fulfil the duties of their position and to devote themselves to the honour and glory of god
but it was theobald's duty to see the honour and glory of god through the eyes of a church which had lived three hundred years without finding reason to change a single one of its opinions
i should doubt whether he ever got as far as doubting the wisdom of his church upon any single matter
his scent for possible mischief was tolerably keen so was christina's and it is likely that if either of them detected in him or herself the first faint symptoms of a want of faith they were nipped no less peremptorily in the bud than signs of selfwill in ernest wereand i should imagine more successfully
yet theobald considered himself and was generally considered to be and indeed perhaps was an exceptionally truthful person indeed he was generally looked upon as an embodiment of all those virtues which make the poor respectable and the rich respected
in the course of time he and his wife became persuaded even to unconsciousness that no one could even dwell under their roof without deep cause for thankfulness
their children their servants their parishioners must be fortunate ipso facto that they were theirs
there was no road to happiness here or hereafter but the road that they had themselves travelled no good people who did not think as they did upon every subject and no reasonable person who had wants the gratification of which would be inconvenient to themtheobald and christina
this was how it came to pass that their children were white and puny they were suffering from homesickness
they were starving through being overcrammed with the wrong things
nature came down upon them but she did not come down on theobald and christina
why should she
they were not leading a starved existence
there are two classes of people in this world those who sin and those who are sinned against if a man must belong to either he had better belong to the first than to the second
chapter xxvii   i will give no more of the details of my hero's earlier years
enough that he struggled through them and at twelve years old knew every page of his latin and greek grammars by heart
he had read the greater part of virgil horace and livy and i do not know how many greek plays he was proficient in arithmetic knew the first four books of euclid thoroughly and had a fair knowledge of french
it was now time he went to school and to school he was accordingly to go under the famous dr skinner of roughborough
theobald had known dr skinner slightly at cambridge
he had been a burning and a shining light in every position he had filled from his boyhood upwards
he was a very great genius
everyone knew this they said indeed that he was one of the few people to whom the word genius could be applied without exaggeration
had he not taken i don't know how many university scholarships in his freshman's year
had he not been afterwards senior wrangler first chancellor's medallist and i do not know how many more things besides
and then he was such a wonderful speaker at the union debating club he had been without a rival and had of course been president his moral charactera point on which so many geniuses were weakwas absolutely irreproachable foremost of all however among his many great qualities and perhaps more remarkable even than his genius was what biographers have called the simpleminded and childlike earnestness of his character an earnestness which might be perceived by the solemnity with which he spoke even about trifles
it is hardly necessary to say he was on the liberal side in politics
his personal appearance was not particularly prepossessing
he was about the middle height portly and had a couple of fierce grey eyes that flashed fire from beneath a pair of great bushy beetling eyebrows and overawed all who came near him
it was in respect of his personal appearance however that if he was vulnerable at all his weak place was to be found
his hair when he was a young man was red but after he had taken his degree he had a brain fever which caused him to have his head shaved when he reappeared he did so wearing a wig and one which was a good deal further off red than his own hair had been
he not only had never discarded his wig but year by year it had edged itself a little more and a little more off red till by the time he was forty there was not a trace of red remaining and his wig was brown
when dr skinner was a very young man hardly more than fiveandtwenty the headmastership of roughborough grammar school had fallen vacant and he had been unhesitatingly appointed
the result justified the selection
dr skinner's pupils distinguished themselves at whichever university they went to
he moulded their minds after the model of his own and stamped an impression upon them which was indelible in after life whatever else a roughborough man might be he was sure to make everyone feel that he was a godfearing earnest christian and a liberal if not a radical in politics
some boys of course were incapable of appreciating the beauty and loftiness of dr skinner's nature
some such boys alas
there will be in every school upon them dr skinner's hand was very properly a heavy one
his hand was against them and theirs against him during the whole time of the connection between them
they not only disliked him but they hated all that he more especially embodied and throughout their lives disliked all that reminded them of him
such boys however were in a minority the spirit of the place being decidedly skinnerian
i once had the honour of playing a game of chess with this great man
it was during the christmas holidays and i had come down to roughborough for a few days to see alethea pontifex who was then living there on business
it was very gracious of him to take notice of me for if i was a light of literature at all it was of the very lightest kind
it is true that in the intervals of business i had written a good deal but my works had been almost exclusively for the stage and for those theatres that devoted themselves to extravaganza and burlesque
i had written many pieces of this description full of puns and comic songs and they had had a fair success but my best piece had been a treatment of english history during the reformation period in the course of which i had introduced cranmer sir thomas more henry the eighth catherine of arragon and thomas cromwell in his youth better known as the malleus monachorum and had made them dance a breakdown
i had also dramatised the pilgrim's progress for a christmas pantomime and made an important scene of vanity fair with mr greatheart apollyon christiana mercy and hopeful as the principal characters
the orchestra played music taken from handel's best known works but the time was a good deal altered and altogether the tunes were not exactly as handel left them
mr greatheart was very stout and he had a red nose he wore a capacious waistcoat and a shirt with a huge frill down the middle of the front
hopeful was up to as much mischief as i could give him he wore the costume of a young swell of the period and had a cigar in his mouth which was continually going out
christiana did not wear much of anything indeed it was said that the dress which the stage manager had originally proposed for her had been considered inadequate even by the lord chamberlain but this is not the case
with all these delinquencies upon my mind it was natural that i should feel convinced of sin while playing chess which i hate with the great dr skinner of roughboroughthe historian of athens and editor of demosthenes
dr skinner moreover was one of those who pride themselves on being able to set people at their ease at once and i had been sitting on the edge of my chair all the evening
but i have always been very easily overawed by a schoolmaster
the game had been a long one and at halfpast nine when supper came in we had each of us a few pieces remaining
what will you take for supper dr skinner
said mrs skinner in a silvery voice
he made no answer for some time but at last in a tone of almost superhuman solemnity he said first nothing and then nothing whatever
by and by however i had a sense come over me as though i were nearer the consummation of all things than i had ever yet been
the room seemed to grow dark as an expression came over dr skinner's face which showed that he was about to speak
the expression gathered force the room grew darker and darker
stay he at length added and i felt that here at any rate was an end to a suspense which was rapidly becoming unbearable
stayi may presently take a glass of cold waterand a small piece of bread and butter
as he said the word butter his voice sank to a hardly audible whisper then there was a sigh as though of relief when the sentence was concluded and the universe this time was safe
another ten minutes of solemn silence finished the game
the doctor rose briskly from his seat and placed himself at the supper table
mrs skinner he exclaimed jauntily what are those mysteriouslooking objects surrounded by potatoes
those are oysters dr skinner
give me some and give overton some
and so on till he had eaten a good plate of oysters a scallop shell of minced veal nicely browned some apple tart and a hunk of bread and cheese
this was the small piece of bread and butter
the cloth was now removed and tumblers with teaspoons in them a lemon or two and a jug of boiling water were placed upon the table
then the great man unbent
his face beamed
and what shall it be to drink
he exclaimed persuasively
shall it be brandy and water
no
it shall be gin and water
gin is the more wholesome liquor
so gin it was hot and stiff too
who can wonder at him or do anything but pity him
was he not headmaster of roughborough school
to whom had he owed money at any time
whose ox had he taken whose ass had he taken or whom had he defrauded
what whisper had ever been breathed against his moral character
if he had become rich it was by the most honourable of all meanshis literary attainments over and above his great works of scholarship his meditations upon the epistle and character of st jude had placed him among the most popular of english theologians it was so exhaustive that no one who bought it need ever meditate upon the subject againindeed it exhausted all who had anything to do with it
he had made  pounds by this work alone and would very likely make another  pounds before he died
a man who had done all this and wanted a piece of bread and butter had a right to announce the fact with some pomp and circumstance
nor should his words be taken without searching for what he used to call a deeper and more hidden meaning
those who searched for this even in his lightest utterances would not be without their reward
they would find that bread and butter was skinnerese for oysterpatties and apple tart and gin hot the true translation of water
but independently of their money value his works had made him a lasting name in literature
so probably gallio was under the impression that his fame would rest upon the treatises on natural history which we gather from seneca that he compiled and which for aught we know may have contained a complete theory of evolution but the treatises are all gone and gallio has become immortal for the very last reason in the world that he expected and for the very last reason that would have flattered his vanity
he has become immortal because he cared nothing about the most important movement with which he was ever brought into connection i wish people who are in search of immortality would lay the lesson to heart and not make so much noise about important movements and so if dr skinner becomes immortal it will probably be for some reason very different from the one which he so fondly imagined
could it be expected to enter into the head of such a man as this that in reality he was making his money by corrupting youth that it was his paid profession to make the worse appear the better reason in the eyes of those who were too young and inexperienced to be able to find him out that he kept out of the sight of those whom he professed to teach material points of the argument for the production of which they had a right to rely upon the honour of anyone who made professions of sincerity that he was a passionate halfturkeycock halfgander of a man whose sallow bilious face and hobblegobble voice could scare the timid but who would take to his heels readily enough if he were met firmly that his meditations on st jude such as they were were cribbed without acknowledgment and would have been beneath contempt if so many people did not believe them to have been written honestly
mrs skinner might have perhaps kept him a little more in his proper place if she had thought it worth while to try but she had enough to attend to in looking after her household and seeing that the boys were well fed and if they were ill properly looked afterwhich she took good care they were
chapter xxviii   ernest had heard awful accounts of dr skinner's temper and of the bullying which the younger boys at roughborough had to put up with at the hands of the bigger ones
he had now got about as much as he could stand and felt as though it must go hard with him if his burdens of whatever kind were to be increased
he did not cry on leaving home but i am afraid he did on being told that he was getting near roughborough
his father and mother were with him having posted from home in their own carriage roughborough had as yet no railway and as it was only some forty miles from battersby this was the easiest way of getting there
on seeing him cry his mother felt flattered and caressed him
she said she knew he must feel very sad at leaving such a happy home and going among people who though they would be very good to him could never never be as good as his dear papa and she had been still she was herself if he only knew it much more deserving of pity than he was for the parting was more painful to her than it could possibly be to him etc and ernest on being told that his tears were for grief at leaving home took it all on trust and did not trouble to investigate the real cause of his tears
as they approached roughborough he pulled himself together and was fairly calm by the time he reached dr skinner's
on their arrival they had luncheon with the doctor and his wife and then mrs skinner took christina over the bedrooms and showed her where her dear little boy was to sleep
whatever men may think about the study of man women do really believe the noblest study for womankind to be woman and christina was too much engrossed with mrs skinner to pay much attention to anything else i daresay mrs skinner too was taking pretty accurate stock of christina
christina was charmed as indeed she generally was with any new acquaintance for she found in them and so must we all something of the nature of a cross as for mrs skinner i imagine she had seen too many christinas to find much regeneration in the sample now before her i believe her private opinion echoed the dictum of a wellknown headmaster who declared that all parents were fools but more especially mothers she was however all smiles and sweetness and christina devoured these graciously as tributes paid more particularly to herself and such as no other mother would have been at all likely to have won
in the meantime theobald and ernest were with dr skinner in his librarythe room where new boys were examined and old ones had up for rebuke or chastisement
if the walls of that room could speak what an amount of blundering and capricious cruelty would they not bear witness to
like all houses dr skinner's had its peculiar smell
in this case the prevailing odour was one of russia leather but along with it there was a subordinate savour as of a chemist's shop
this came from a small laboratory in one corner of the roomthe possession of which together with the free chattery and smattery use of such words as carbonate hyposulphite phosphate and affinity were enough to convince even the most sceptical that dr skinner had a profound knowledge of chemistry
i may say in passing that dr skinner had dabbled in a great many other things as well as chemistry
he was a man of many small knowledges and each of them dangerous
i remember alethea pontifex once said in her wicked way to me that dr skinner put her in mind of the bourbon princes on their return from exile after the battle of waterloo only that he was their exact converse for whereas they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing dr skinner had learned everything and forgotten everything
and this puts me in mind of another of her wicked sayings about dr skinner
she told me one day that he had the harmlessness of the serpent and the wisdom of the dove
but to return to dr skinner's library over the chimneypiece there was a bishop's half length portrait of dr skinner himself painted by the elder pickersgill whose merit dr skinner had been among the first to discern and foster
there were no other pictures in the library but in the diningroom there was a fine collection which the doctor had got together with his usual consummate taste
he added to it largely in later life and when it came to the hammer at christie's as it did not long since it was found to comprise many of the latest and most matured works of solomon hart o'neil charles landseer and more of our recent academicians than i can at the moment remember
there were thus brought together and exhibited at one view many works which had attracted attention at the academy exhibitions and as to whose ultimate destiny there had been some curiosity
the prices realised were disappointing to the executors but then these things are so much a matter of chance
an unscrupulous writer in a wellknown weekly paper had written the collection down
moreover there had been one or two large sales a short time before dr skinner's so that at this last there was rather a panic and a reaction against the high prices that had ruled lately
the table of the library was loaded with books many deep mss
of all kinds were confusedly mixed up with themboys' exercises probably and examination papersbut all littering untidily about
the room in fact was as depressing from its slatternliness as from its atmosphere of erudition
theobald and ernest as they entered it stumbled over a large hole in the turkey carpet and the dust that rose showed how long it was since it had been taken up and beaten
this i should say was no fault of mrs skinner's but was due to the doctor himself who declared that if his papers were once disturbed it would be the death of him
near the window was a green cage containing a pair of turtle doves whose plaintive cooing added to the melancholy of the place
the walls were covered with book shelves from floor to ceiling and on every shelf the books stood in double rows
it was horrible
prominent among the most prominent upon the most prominent shelf were a series of splendidly bound volumes entitled skinner's works
boys are sadly apt to rush to conclusions and ernest believed that dr skinner knew all the books in this terrible library and that he if he were to be any good should have to learn them too
his heart fainted within him
he was told to sit on a chair against the wall and did so while dr skinner talked to theobald upon the topics of the day
he talked about the hampden controversy then raging and discoursed learnedly about praemunire then he talked about the revolution which had just broken out in sicily and rejoiced that the pope had refused to allow foreign troops to pass through his dominions in order to crush it
dr skinner and the other masters took in the times among them and dr skinner echoed the times' leaders
in those days there were no penny papers and theobald only took in the spectatorfor he was at that time on the whig side in politics besides this he used to receive the ecclesiastical gazette once a month but he saw no other papers and was amazed at the ease and fluency with which dr skinner ran from subject to subject
the pope's action in the matter of the sicilian revolution naturally led the doctor to the reforms which his holiness had introduced into his dominions and he laughed consumedly over the joke which had not long since appeared in punch to the effect that pio no no should rather have been named pio yes yes because as the doctor explained he granted everything his subjects asked for
anything like a pun went straight to dr skinner's heart
then he went on to the matter of these reforms themselves
they opened up a new era in the history of christendom and would have such momentous and farreaching consequences that they might even lead to a reconciliation between the churches of england and rome
dr skinner had lately published a pamphlet upon this subject which had shown great learning and had attacked the church of rome in a way which did not promise much hope of reconciliation
he had grounded his attack upon the letters amdg which he had seen outside a roman catholic chapel and which of course stood for ad mariam dei genetricem
could anything be more idolatrous
i am told by the way that i must have let my memory play me one of the tricks it often does play me when i said the doctor proposed ad mariam dei genetricem as the full harmonies so to speak which should be constructed upon the bass amdg for that this is bad latin and that the doctor really harmonised the letters thus ave maria dei genetrix
no doubt the doctor did what was right in the matter of latinityi have forgotten the little latin i ever knew and am not going to look the matter up but i believe the doctor said ad mariam dei genetricem and if so we may be sure that ad mariam dei genetricem is good enough latin at any rate for ecclesiastical purposes
the reply of the local priest had not yet appeared and dr skinner was jubilant but when the answer appeared and it was solemnly declared that amdg
stood for nothing more dangerous than ad majorem dei gloriam it was felt that though this subterfuge would not succeed with any intelligent englishman still it was a pity dr skinner had selected this particular point for his attack for he had to leave his enemy in possession of the field
when people are left in possession of the field spectators have an awkward habit of thinking that their adversary does not dare to come to the scratch
dr skinner was telling theobald all about his pamphlet and i doubt whether this gentleman was much more comfortable than ernest himself
he was bored for in his heart he hated liberalism though he was ashamed to say so and as i have said professed to be on the whig side
he did not want to be reconciled to the church of rome he wanted to make all roman catholics turn protestants and could never understand why they would not do so but the doctor talked in such a truly liberal spirit and shut him up so sharply when he tried to edge in a word or two that he had to let him have it all his own way and this was not what he was accustomed to
he was wondering how he could bring it to an end when a diversion was created by the discovery that ernest had begun to crydoubtless through an intense but inarticulate sense of a boredom greater than he could bear
he was evidently in a highly nervous state and a good deal upset by the excitement of the morning mrs skinner therefore who came in with christina at this juncture proposed that he should spend the afternoon with mrs jay the matron and not be introduced to his young companions until the following morning
his father and mother now bade him an affectionate farewell and the lad was handed over to mrs jay
o schoolmastersif any of you read this bookbear in mind when any particularly timid drivelling urchin is brought by his papa into your study and you treat him with the contempt which he deserves and afterwards make his life a burden to him for yearsbear in mind that it is exactly in the disguise of such a boy as this that your future chronicler will appear
never see a wretched little heavyeyed mite sitting on the edge of a chair against your study wall without saying to yourselves perhaps this boy is he who if i am not careful will one day tell the world what manner of man i was
if even two or three schoolmasters learn this lesson and remember it the preceding chapters will not have been written in vain
chapter xxix   soon after his father and mother had left him ernest dropped asleep over a book which mrs jay had given him and he did not awake till dusk
then he sat down on a stool in front of the fire which showed pleasantly in the late january twilight and began to muse
he felt weak feeble ill at ease and unable to see his way out of the innumerable troubles that were before him
perhaps he said to himself he might even die but this far from being an end of his troubles would prove the beginning of new ones for at the best he would only go to grandpapa pontifex and grandmamma allaby and though they would perhaps be more easy to get on with than papa and mamma yet they were undoubtedly not so really good and were more worldly moreover they were grownup peopleespecially grandpapa pontifex who so far as he could understand had been very much grownup and he did not know why but there was always something that kept him from loving any grownup people very muchexcept one or two of the servants who had indeed been as nice as anything that he could imagine
besides even if he were to die and go to heaven he supposed he should have to complete his education somewhere
in the meantime his father and mother were rolling along the muddy roads each in his or her own corner of the carriage and each revolving many things which were and were not to come to pass
times have changed since i last showed them to the reader as sitting together silently in a carriage but except as regards their mutual relations they have altered singularly little
when i was younger i used to think the prayer book was wrong in requiring us to say the general confession twice a week from childhood to old age without making provision for our not being quite such great sinners at seventy as we had been at seven granted that we should go to the wash like tablecloths at least once a week still i used to think a day ought to come when we should want rather less rubbing and scrubbing at
now that i have grown older myself i have seen that the church has estimated probabilities better than i had done
the pair said not a word to one another but watched the fading light and naked trees the brown fields with here and there a melancholy cottage by the road side and the rain that fell fast upon the carriage windows
it was a kind of afternoon on which nice people for the most part like to be snug at home and theobald was a little snappish at reflecting how many miles he had to post before he could be at his own fireside again
however there was nothing for it so the pair sat quietly and watched the roadside objects flit by them and get greyer and grimmer as the light faded
though they spoke not to one another there was one nearer to each of them with whom they could converse freely
i hope said theobald to himself i hope he'll workor else that skinner will make him
i don't like skinner i never did like him but he is unquestionably a man of genius and no one turns out so many pupils who succeed at oxford and cambridge and that is the best test
i have done my share towards starting him well
skinner said he had been well grounded and was very forward
i suppose he will presume upon it now and do nothing for his nature is an idle one
he is not fond of me i'm sure he is not
he ought to be after all the trouble i have taken with him but he is ungrateful and selfish
it is an unnatural thing for a boy not to be fond of his own father
if he was fond of me i should be fond of him but i cannot like a son who i am sure dislikes me
he shrinks out of my way whenever he sees me coming near him
he will not stay five minutes in the same room with me if he can help it
he is deceitful
he would not want to hide himself away so much if he were not deceitful
that is a bad sign and one which makes me fear he will grow up extravagant
i am sure he will grow up extravagant
i should have given him more pocketmoney if i had not known thisbut what is the good of giving him pocketmoney
it is all gone directly
if he doesn't buy something with it he gives it away to the first little boy or girl he sees who takes his fancy
he forgets that it's my money he is giving away
i give him money that he may have money and learn to know its uses not that he may go and squander it immediately
i wish he was not so fond of music it will interfere with his latin and greek
i will stop it as much as i can
why when he was translating livy the other day he slipped out handel's name in mistake for hannibal's and his mother tells me he knows half the tunes in the 'messiah' by heart
what should a boy of his age know about the 'messiah'
if i had shown half as many dangerous tendencies when i was a boy my father would have apprenticed me to a greengrocer of that i'm very sure etc etc
then his thoughts turned to egypt and the tenth plague
it seemed to him that if the little egyptians had been anything like ernest the plague must have been something very like a blessing in disguise
if the israelites were to come to england now he should be greatly tempted not to let them go
mrs theobald's thoughts ran in a different current
lord lonsford's grandsonit's a pity his name is figgins however blood is blood as much through the female line as the male indeed perhaps even more so if the truth were known
i wonder who mr figgins was
i think mrs skinner said he was dead however i must find out all about him
it would be delightful if young figgins were to ask ernest home for the holidays
who knows but he might meet lord lonsford himself or at any rate some of lord lonsford's other descendants
meanwhile the boy himself was still sitting moodily before the fire in mrs jay's room
papa and mamma he was saying to himself are much better and cleverer than anyone else but i alas
shall never be either good or clever
mrs pontifex continued  perhaps it would be best to get young figgins on a visit to ourselves first
that would be charming
theobald would not like it for he does not like children i must see how i can manage it for it would be so nice to have young figginsor stay
ernest shall go and stay with figgins and meet the future lord lonsford who i should think must be about ernest's age and then if he and ernest were to become friends ernest might ask him to battersby and he might fall in love with charlotte
i think we have done most wisely in sending ernest to dr skinner's
dr skinner's piety is no less remarkable than his genius
one can tell these things at a glance and he must have felt it about me no less strongly than i about him
i think he seemed much struck with theobald and myselfindeed theobald's intellectual power must impress any one and i was showing i do believe to my best advantage
when i smiled at him and said i left my boy in his hands with the most entire confidence that he would be as well cared for as if he were at my own house i am sure he was greatly pleased
i should not think many of the mothers who bring him boys can impress him so favourably or say such nice things to him as i did
my smile is sweet when i desire to make it so
i never was perhaps exactly pretty but i was always admitted to be fascinating
dr skinner is a very handsome mantoo good on the whole i should say for mrs skinner
theobald says he is not handsome but men are no judges and he has such a pleasant bright face
i think my bonnet became me
as soon as i get home i will tell chambers to trim my blue and yellow merino with etc etc
all this time the letter which has been given above was lying in christina's private little japanese cabinet read and reread and approved of many times over not to say if the truth were known rewritten more than once though dated as in the first instanceand this too though christina was fond enough of a joke in a small way
ernest still in mrs jay's room mused onward
grownup people he said to himself when they were ladies and gentlemen never did naughty things but he was always doing them
he had heard that some grownup people were worldly which of course was wrong still this was quite distinct from being naughty and did not get them punished or scolded
his own papa and mamma were not even worldly they had often explained to him that they were exceptionally unworldly he well knew that they had never done anything naughty since they had been children and that even as children they had been nearly faultless
oh
how different from himself
when should he learn to love his papa and mamma as they had loved theirs
how could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they or even tolerably good and wise
alas
never
it could not be
he did not love his papa and mamma in spite of all their goodness both in themselves and to him
he hated papa and did not like mamma and this was what none but a bad and ungrateful boy would do after all that had been done for him
besides he did not like sunday he did not like anything that was really good his tastes were low and such as he was ashamed of
he liked people best if they sometimes swore a little so long as it was not at him
as for his catechism and bible readings he had no heart in them
he had never attended to a sermon in his life
even when he had been taken to hear mr vaughan at brighton who as everyone knew preached such beautiful sermons for children he had been very glad when it was all over nor did he believe he could get through church at all if it was not for the voluntary upon the organ and the hymns and chanting
the catechism was awful
he had never been able to understand what it was that he desired of his lord god and heavenly father nor had he yet got hold of a single idea in connection with the word sacrament
his duty towards his neighbour was another bugbear
it seemed to him that he had duties towards everybody lying in wait for him upon every side but that nobody had any duties towards him
then there was that awful and mysterious word 'business'
what did it all mean
what was 'business'
his papa was a wonderfully good man of business his mamma had often told him sobut he should never be one
it was hopeless and very awful for people were continually telling him that he would have to earn his own living
no doubt but howconsidering how stupid idle ignorant selfindulgent and physically puny he was
all grownup people were clever except servantsand even these were cleverer than ever he should be
oh why why why could not people be born into the world as grownup persons
then he thought of casabianca
he had been examined in that poem by his father not long before
'when only would he leave his position
to whom did he call
did he get an answer
why
how many times did he call upon his father
what happened to him
what was the noblest life that perished there
do you think so
why do you think so'
and all the rest of it
of course he thought casabianca's was the noblest life that perished there there could be no two opinions about that it never occurred to him that the moral of the poem was that young people cannot begin too soon to exercise discretion in the obedience they pay to their papa and mamma
oh no
the only thought in his mind was that he should never never have been like casabianca and that casabianca would have despised him so much if he could have known him that he would not have condescended to speak to him
there was nobody else in the ship worth reckoning at all it did not matter how much they were blown up
mrs hemans knew them all and they were a very indifferent lot
besides casabianca was so goodlooking and came of such a good family
and thus his small mind kept wandering on till he could follow it no longer and again went off into a doze
chapter xxx   next morning theobald and christina arose feeling a little tired from their journey but happy in that best of all happiness the approbation of their consciences
it would be their boy's fault henceforth if he were not good and as prosperous as it was at all desirable that he should be
what more could parents do than they had done
the answer nothing will rise as readily to the lips of the reader as to those of theobald and christina themselves
a few days later the parents were gratified at receiving the following letter from their son     my dear mammai am very well
dr skinner made me do about the    horse free and exulting roaming in the wide fields in latin verse but    as i had done it with papa i knew how to do it and it was nearly all    right and he put me in the fourth form under mr templer and i have    to begin a new latin grammar not like the old but much harder
i    know you wish me to work and i will try very hard
with best love to    joey and charlotte and to papa i remain your affectionate son    ernest
nothing could be nicer or more proper
it really did seem as though he were inclined to turn over a new leaf
the boys had all come back the examinations were over and the routine of the half year began ernest found that his fears about being kicked about and bullied were exaggerated
nobody did anything very dreadful to him
he had to run errands between certain hours for the elder boys and to take his turn at greasing the footballs and so forth but there was an excellent spirit in the school as regards bullying
nevertheless he was far from happy
dr skinner was much too like his father
true ernest was not thrown in with him much yet but he was always there there was no knowing at what moment he might not put in an appearance and whenever he did show it was to storm about something
he was like the lion in the bishop of oxford's sunday storyalways liable to rush out from behind some bush and devour some one when he was least expected
he called ernest an audacious reptile and said he wondered the earth did not open and swallow him up because he pronounced thalia with a short i
and this to me he thundered who never made a false quantity in my life
surely he would have been a much nicer person if he had made false quantities in his youth like other people
ernest could not imagine how the boys in dr skinner's form continued to live but yet they did and even throve and strange as it may seem idolised him or professed to do so in after life
to ernest it seemed like living on the crater of vesuvius
he was himself as has been said in mr templer's form who was snappish but not downright wicked and was very easy to crib under
ernest used to wonder how mr templer could be so blind for he supposed mr templer must have cribbed when he was at school and would ask himself whether he should forget his youth when he got old as mr templer had forgotten his
he used to think he never could possibly forget any part of it
then there was mrs jay who was sometimes very alarming
a few days after the half year had commenced there being some little extra noise in the hall she rushed in with her spectacles on her forehead and her cap strings flying and called the boy whom ernest had selected as his hero the rampingestscampingestracketytacketytowrowroaringest boy in the whole school
but she used to say things that ernest liked
if the doctor went out to dinner and there were no prayers she would come in and say young gentlemen prayers are excused this evening and take her for all in all she was a kindly old soul enough
most boys soon discover the difference between noise and actual danger but to others it is so unnatural to menace unless they mean mischief that they are long before they leave off taking turkeycocks and ganders au serieux
ernest was one of the latter sort and found the atmosphere of roughborough so gusty that he was glad to shrink out of sight and out of mind whenever he could
he disliked the games worse even than the squalls of the classroom and hall for he was still feeble not filling out and attaining his full strength till a much later age than most boys
this was perhaps due to the closeness with which his father had kept him to his books in childhood but i think in part also to a tendency towards lateness in attaining maturity hereditary in the pontifex family which was one also of unusual longevity
at thirteen or fourteen he was a mere bag of bones with upper arms about as thick as the wrists of other boys of his age his little chest was pigeonbreasted he appeared to have no strength or stamina whatever and finding he always went to the wall in physical encounters whether undertaken in jest or earnest even with boys shorter than himself the timidity natural to childhood increased upon him to an extent that i am afraid amounted to cowardice
this rendered him even less capable than he might otherwise have been for as confidence increases power so want of confidence increases impotence
after he had had the breath knocked out of him and been well shinned half a dozen times in scrimmages at footballscrimmages in which he had become involved sorely against his willhe ceased to see any further fun in football and shirked that noble game in a way that got him into trouble with the elder boys who would stand no shirking on the part of the younger ones
he was as useless and ill at ease with cricket as with football nor in spite of all his efforts could he ever throw a ball or a stone
it soon became plain therefore to everyone that pontifex was a young muff a mollycoddle not to be tortured but still not to be rated highly
he was not however actively unpopular for it was seen that he was quite square inter pares not at all vindictive easily pleased perfectly free with whatever little money he had no greater lover of his school work than of the games and generally more inclinable to moderate vice than to immoderate virtue
these qualities will prevent any boy from sinking very low in the opinion of his schoolfellows but ernest thought he had fallen lower than he probably had and hated and despised himself for what he as much as anyone else believed to be his cowardice
he did not like the boys whom he thought like himself
his heroes were strong and vigorous and the less they inclined towards him the more he worshipped them
all this made him very unhappy for it never occurred to him that the instinct which made him keep out of games for which he was ill adapted was more reasonable than the reason which would have driven him into them
nevertheless he followed his instinct for the most part rather than his reason
sapiens suam si sapientiam norit
chapter xxxi   with the masters ernest was ere long in absolute disgrace
he had more liberty now than he had known heretofore
the heavy hand and watchful eye of theobald were no longer about his path and about his bed and spying out all his ways and punishment by way of copying out lines of virgil was a very different thing from the savage beatings of his father
the copying out in fact was often less trouble than the lesson
latin and greek had nothing in them which commended them to his instinct as likely to bring him peace even at the last still less did they hold out any hope of doing so within some more reasonable time
the deadness inherent in these defunct languages themselves had never been artificially counteracted by a system of bona fide rewards for application
there had been any amount of punishments for want of application but no good comfortable bribes had baited the hook which was to allure him to his good
indeed the more pleasant side of learning to do this or that had always been treated as something with which ernest had no concern
we had no business with pleasant things at all at any rate very little business at any rate not he ernest
we were put into this world not for pleasure but duty and pleasure had in it something more or less sinful in its very essence
if we were doing anything we liked we or at any rate he ernest should apologise and think he was being very mercifully dealt with if not at once told to go and do something else
with what he did not like however it was different the more he disliked a thing the greater the presumption that it was right
it never occurred to him that the presumption was in favour of the rightness of what was most pleasant and that the onus of proving that it was not right lay with those who disputed its being so
i have said more than once that he believed in his own depravity never was there a little mortal more ready to accept without cavil whatever he was told by those who were in authority over him he thought at least that he believed it for as yet he knew nothing of that other ernest that dwelt within him and was so much stronger and more real than the ernest of which he was conscious
the dumb ernest persuaded with inarticulate feelings too swift and sure to be translated into such debateable things as words but practically insisted as follows     growing is not the easy plain sailing business that it is commonly    supposed to be it is hard workharder than any but a growing boy can    understand it requires attention and you are not strong enough to    attend to your bodily growth and to your lessons too
besides latin    and greek are great humbug the more people know of them the more    odious they generally are the nice people whom you delight in either    never knew any at all or forgot what they had learned as soon as they    could they never turned to the classics after they were no longer    forced to read them therefore they are nonsense all very well in    their own time and country but out of place here
never learn    anything until you find you have been made uncomfortable for a good    long while by not knowing it when you find that you have occasion for    this or that knowledge or foresee that you will have occasion for it    shortly the sooner you learn it the better but till then spend your    time in growing bone and muscle these will be much more useful to you    than latin and greek nor will you ever be able to make them if you do    not do so now whereas latin and greek can be acquired at any time by    those who want them
you are surrounded on every side by lies which would deceive even the    elect if the elect were not generally so uncommonly wide awake the    self of which you are conscious your reasoning and reflecting self    will believe these lies and bid you act in accordance with them
this    conscious self of yours ernest is a prig begotten of prigs and    trained in priggishness i will not allow it to shape your actions    though it will doubtless shape your words for many a year to come
your papa is not here to beat you now this is a change in the    conditions of your existence and should be followed by changed    actions
obey me your true self and things will go tolerably well    with you but only listen to that outward and visible old husk of    yours which is called your father and i will rend you in pieces even    unto the third and fourth generation as one who has hated god for i    ernest am the god who made you
how shocked ernest would have been if he could have heard the advice he was receiving what consternation too there would have been at battersby but the matter did not end here for this same wicked inner self gave him bad advice about his pocket money the choice of his companions and on the whole ernest was attentive and obedient to its behests more so than theobald had been
the consequence was that he learned little his mind growing more slowly and his body rather faster than heretofore and when by and by his inner self urged him in directions where he met obstacles beyond his strength to combat he tookthough with passionate compunctions of consciencethe nearest course to the one from which he was debarred which circumstances would allow
it may be guessed that ernest was not the chosen friend of the more sedate and wellconducted youths then studying at roughborough
some of the less desirable boys used to go to publichouses and drink more beer than was good for them ernest's inner self can hardly have told him to ally himself to these young gentlemen but he did so at an early age and was sometimes made pitiably sick by an amount of beer which would have produced no effect upon a stronger boy
ernest's inner self must have interposed at this point and told him that there was not much fun in this for he dropped the habit ere it had taken firm hold of him and never resumed it but he contracted another at the disgracefully early age of between thirteen and fourteen which he did not relinquish though to the present day his conscious self keeps dinging it into him that the less he smokes the better
and so matters went on till my hero was nearly fourteen years old
if by that time he was not actually a young blackguard he belonged to a debateable class between the subreputable and the upper disreputable with perhaps rather more leaning to the latter except so far as vices of meanness were concerned from which he was fairly free
i gather this partly from what ernest has told me and partly from his school bills which i remember theobald showed me with much complaining
there was an institution at roughborough called the monthly merit money the maximum sum which a boy of ernest's age could get was four shillings and sixpence several boys got four shillings and few less than sixpence but ernest never got more than halfacrown and seldom more than eighteen pence his average would i should think be about one and nine pence which was just too much for him to rank among the downright bad boys but too little to put him among the good ones
chapter xxxii   i must now return to miss alethea pontifex of whom i have said perhaps too little hitherto considering how great her influence upon my hero's destiny proved to be
on the death of her father which happened when she was about thirtytwo years old she parted company with her sisters between whom and herself there had been little sympathy and came up to london
she was determined so she said to make the rest of her life as happy as she could and she had clearer ideas about the best way of setting to work to do this than women or indeed men generally have
her fortune consisted as i have said of  pounds which had come to her by her mother's marriage settlements and  pounds left her by her father over both which sums she had now absolute control
these brought her in about  pounds a year and the money being invested in none but the soundest securities she had no anxiety about her income
she meant to be rich so she formed a scheme of expenditure which involved an annual outlay of about  pounds and determined to put the rest by
if i do this she said laughingly i shall probably just succeed in living comfortably within my income
in accordance with this scheme she took unfurnished apartments in a house in gower street of which the lower floors were let out as offices
john pontifex tried to get her to take a house to herself but alethea told him to mind his own business so plainly that he had to beat a retreat
she had never liked him and from that time dropped him almost entirely
without going much into society she yet became acquainted with most of the men and women who had attained a position in the literary artistic and scientific worlds and it was singular how highly her opinion was valued in spite of her never having attempted in any way to distinguish herself
she could have written if she had chosen but she enjoyed seeing others write and encouraging them better than taking a more active part herself
perhaps literary people liked her all the better because she did not write
i as she very well knew had always been devoted to her and she might have had a score of other admirers if she had liked but she had discouraged them all and railed at matrimony as women seldom do unless they have a comfortable income of their own
she by no means however railed at man as she railed at matrimony and though living after a fashion in which even the most censorious could find nothing to complain of as far as she properly could she defended those of her own sex whom the world condemned most severely
in religion she was i should think as nearly a freethinker as anyone could be whose mind seldom turned upon the subject
she went to church but disliked equally those who aired either religion or irreligion
i remember once hearing her press a late wellknown philosopher to write a novel instead of pursuing his attacks upon religion
the philosopher did not much like this and dilated upon the importance of showing people the folly of much that they pretended to believe
she smiled and said demurely have they not moses and the prophets
let them hear them
but she would say a wicked thing quietly on her own account sometimes and called my attention once to a note in her prayerbook which gave account of the walk to emmaus with the two disciples and how christ had said to them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spokenthe all being printed in small capitals
though scarcely on terms with her brother john she had kept up closer relations with theobald and his family and had paid a few days' visit to battersby once in every two years or so
alethea had always tried to like theobald and join forces with him as much as she could for they two were the hares of the family the rest being all hounds but it was no use
i believe her chief reason for maintaining relations with her brother was that she might keep an eye on his children and give them a lift if they proved nice
when miss pontifex had come down to battersby in old times the children had not been beaten and their lessons had been made lighter
she easily saw that they were overworked and unhappy but she could hardly guess how allreaching was the regime under which they lived
she knew she could not interfere effectually then and wisely forbore to make too many enquiries
her time if ever it was to come would be when the children were no longer living under the same roof as their parents
it ended in her making up her mind to have nothing to do with either joey or charlotte but to see so much of ernest as should enable her to form an opinion about his disposition and abilities
he had now been a year and a half at roughborough and was nearly fourteen years old so that his character had begun to shape
his aunt had not seen him for some little time and thinking that if she was to exploit him she could do so now perhaps better than at any other time she resolved to go down to roughborough on some pretext which should be good enough for theobald and to take stock of her nephew under circumstances in which she could get him for some few hours to herself
accordingly in august  when ernest was just entering on his fourth half year a cab drove up to dr skinner's door with miss pontifex who asked and obtained leave for ernest to come and dine with her at the swan hotel
she had written to ernest to say she was coming and he was of course on the look out for her
he had not seen her for so long that he was rather shy at first but her good nature soon set him at his ease
she was so strongly biassed in favour of anything young that her heart warmed towards him at once though his appearance was less prepossessing than she had hoped
she took him to a cake shop and gave him whatever he liked as soon as she had got him off the school premises and ernest felt at once that she contrasted favourably even with his aunts the misses allaby who were so very sweet and good
the misses allaby were very poor sixpence was to them what five shillings was to alethea
what chance had they against one who if she had a mind could put by out of her income twice as much as they poor women could spend
the boy had plenty of prattle in him when he was not snubbed and alethea encouraged him to chatter about whatever came uppermost
he was always ready to trust anyone who was kind to him it took many years to make him reasonably wary in this respectif indeed as i sometimes doubt he ever will be as wary as he ought to beand in a short time he had quite dissociated his aunt from his papa and mamma and the rest with whom his instinct told him he should be on his guard
little did he know how great as far as he was concerned were the issues that depended upon his behaviour
if he had known he would perhaps have played his part less successfully
his aunt drew from him more details of his home and school life than his papa and mamma would have approved of but he had no idea that he was being pumped
she got out of him all about the happy sunday evenings and how he and joey and charlotte quarrelled sometimes but she took no side and treated everything as though it were a matter of course
like all the boys he could mimic dr skinner and when warmed with dinner and two glasses of sherry which made him nearly tipsy he favoured his aunt with samples of the doctor's manner and spoke of him familiarly as sam
sam he said is an awful old humbug
it was the sherry that brought out this piece of swagger for whatever else he was dr skinner was a reality to master ernest before which indeed he sank into his boots in no time
alethea smiled and said i must not say anything to that must i
ernest said i suppose not and was checked
byandby he vented a number of small secondhand priggishnesses which he had caught up believing them to be the correct thing and made it plain that even at that early age ernest believed in ernest with a belief which was amusing from its absurdity
his aunt judged him charitably as she was sure to do she knew very well where the priggishness came from and seeing that the string of his tongue had been loosened sufficiently gave him no more sherry
it was after dinner however that he completed the conquest of his aunt
she then discovered that like herself he was passionately fond of music and that too of the highest class
he knew and hummed or whistled to her all sorts of pieces out of the works of the great masters which a boy of his age could hardly be expected to know and it was evident that this was purely instinctive inasmuch as music received no kind of encouragement at roughborough
there was no boy in the school as fond of music as he was
he picked up his knowledge he said from the organist of st michael's church who used to practise sometimes on a weekday afternoon
ernest had heard the organ booming away as he was passing outside the church and had sneaked inside and up into the organ loft
in the course of time the organist became accustomed to him as a familiar visitant and the pair became friends
it was this which decided alethea that the boy was worth taking pains with
he likes the best music she thought and he hates dr skinner
this is a very fair beginning
when she sent him away at night with a sovereign in his pocket and he had only hoped to get five shillings she felt as though she had had a good deal more than her money's worth for her money
chapter xxxiii   next day miss pontifex returned to town with her thoughts full of her nephew and how she could best be of use to him
it appeared to her that to do him any real service she must devote herself almost entirely to him she must in fact give up living in london at any rate for a long time and live at roughborough where she could see him continually
this was a serious undertaking she had lived in london for the last twelve years and naturally disliked the prospect of a small country town such as roughborough
was it a prudent thing to attempt so much
must not people take their chances in this world
can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there
should not each look after his own happiness and will not the world be best carried on if everyone minds his own business and leaves other people to mind theirs
life is not a donkey race in which everyone is to ride his neighbour's donkey and the last is to win and the psalmist long since formulated a common experience when he declared that no man may deliver his brother nor make agreement unto god for him for it cost more to redeem their souls so that he must let that alone for ever
all these excellent reasons for letting her nephew alone occurred to her and many more but against them there pleaded a woman's love for children and her desire to find someone among the younger branches of her own family to whom she could become warmly attached and whom she could attach warmly to herself
over and above this she wanted someone to leave her money to she was not going to leave it to people about whom she knew very little merely because they happened to be sons and daughters of brothers and sisters whom she had never liked
she knew the power and value of money exceedingly well and how many lovable people suffer and die yearly for the want of it she was little likely to leave it without being satisfied that her legatees were square lovable and more or less hard up
she wanted those to have it who would be most likely to use it genially and sensibly and whom it would thus be likely to make most happy if she could find one such among her nephews and nieces so much the better it was worth taking a great deal of pains to see whether she could or could not but if she failed she must find an heir who was not related to her by blood
of course she had said to me more than once i shall make a mess of it
i shall choose some nicelooking welldressed screw with gentlemanly manners which will take me in and he will go and paint academy pictures or write for the times or do something just as horrid the moment the breath is out of my body
as yet however she had made no will at all and this was one of the few things that troubled her
i believe she would have left most of her money to me if i had not stopped her
my father left me abundantly well off and my mode of life has been always simple so that i have never known uneasiness about money moreover i was especially anxious that there should be no occasion given for illnatured talk she knew well therefore that her leaving her money to me would be of all things the most likely to weaken the ties that existed between us provided that i was aware of it but i did not mind her talking about whom she should make her heir so long as it was well understood that i was not to be the person
ernest had satisfied her as having enough in him to tempt her strongly to take him up but it was not till after many days' reflection that she gravitated towards actually doing so with all the break in her daily ways that this would entail
at least she said it took her some days and certainly it appeared to do so but from the moment she had begun to broach the subject i had guessed how things were going to end
it was now arranged she should take a house at roughborough and go and live there for a couple of years
as a compromise however to meet some of my objections it was also arranged that she should keep her rooms in gower street and come to town for a week once in each month of course also she would leave roughborough for the greater part of the holidays
after two years the thing was to come to an end unless it proved a great success
she should by that time at any rate have made up her mind what the boy's character was and would then act as circumstances might determine
the pretext she put forward ostensibly was that her doctor said she ought to be a year or two in the country after so many years of london life and had recommended roughborough on account of the purity of its air and its easy access to and from londonfor by this time the railway had reached it
she was anxious not to give her brother and sister any right to complain if on seeing more of her nephew she found she could not get on with him and she was also anxious not to raise false hopes of any kind in the boy's own mind
having settled how everything was to be she wrote to theobald and said she meant to take a house in roughborough from the michaelmas then approaching and mentioned as though casually that one of the attractions of the place would be that her nephew was at school there and she should hope to see more of him than she had done hitherto
theobald and christina knew how dearly alethea loved london and thought it very odd that she should want to go and live at roughborough but they did not suspect that she was going there solely on her nephew's account much less that she had thought of making ernest her heir
if they had guessed this they would have been so jealous that i half believe they would have asked her to go and live somewhere else
alethea however was two or three years younger than theobald she was still some years short of fifty and might very well live to eightyfive or ninety her money therefore was not worth taking much trouble about and her brother and sisterinlaw had dismissed it so to speak from their minds with costs assuming however that if anything did happen to her while they were still alive the money would as a matter of course come to them
the prospect of alethea seeing much of ernest was a serious matter
christina smelt mischief from afar as indeed she often did
alethea was worldlyas worldly that is to say as a sister of theobald's could be
in her letter to theobald she had said she knew how much of his and christina's thoughts were taken up with anxiety for the boy's welfare
alethea had thought this handsome enough but christina had wanted something better and stronger
how can she know how much we think of our darling
she had exclaimed when theobald showed her his sister's letter
i think my dear alethea would understand these things better if she had children of her own
the least that would have satisfied christina was to have been told that there never yet had been any parents comparable to theobald and herself
she did not feel easy that an alliance of some kind would not grow up between aunt and nephew and neither she nor theobald wanted ernest to have any allies
joey and charlotte were quite as many allies as were good for him
after all however if alethea chose to go and live at roughborough they could not well stop her and must make the best of it
in a few weeks' time alethea did choose to go and live at roughborough
a house was found with a field and a nice little garden which suited her very well
at any rate she said to herself i will have fresh eggs and flowers
she even considered the question of keeping a cow but in the end decided not to do so
she furnished her house throughout anew taking nothing whatever from her establishment in gower street and by michaelmasfor the house was empty when she took itshe was settled comfortably and had begun to make herself at home
one of miss pontifex's first moves was to ask a dozen of the smartest and most gentlemanly boys to breakfast with her
from her seat in church she could see the faces of the upperform boys and soon made up her mind which of them it would be best to cultivate
miss pontifex sitting opposite the boys in church and reckoning them up with her keen eyes from under her veil by all a woman's criteria came to a truer conclusion about the greater number of those she scrutinized than even dr skinner had done
she fell in love with one boy from seeing him put on his gloves
miss pontifex as i have said got hold of some of these youngsters through ernest and fed them well
no boy can resist being fed well by a goodnatured and still handsome woman
boys are very like nice dogs in this respectgive them a bone and they will like you at once
alethea employed every other little artifice which she thought likely to win their allegiance to herself and through this their countenance for her nephew
she found the football club in a slight money difficulty and at once gave half a sovereign towards its removal
the boys had no chance against her she shot them down one after another as easily as though they had been roosting pheasants
nor did she escape scathless herself for as she wrote to me she quite lost her heart to half a dozen of them
how much nicer they are she said and how much more they know than those who profess to teach them
i believe it has been lately maintained that it is the young and fair who are the truly old and truly experienced inasmuch as it is they who alone have a living memory to guide them the whole charm it has been said of youth lies in its advantage over age in respect of experience and when this has for some reason failed or been misapplied the charm is broken
when we say that we are getting old we should say rather that we are getting new or young and are suffering from inexperience trying to do things which we have never done before and failing worse and worse till in the end we are landed in the utter impotence of death
miss pontifex died many a long year before the above passage was written but she had arrived independently at much the same conclusion
she first therefore squared the boys
dr skinner was even more easily dealt with
he and mrs skinner called as a matter of course as soon as miss pontifex was settled
she fooled him to the top of his bent and obtained the promise of a ms copy of one of his minor poems for dr skinner had the reputation of being quite one of our most facile and elegant minor poets on the occasion of his first visit
the other masters and masters' wives were not forgotten
alethea laid herself out to please as indeed she did wherever she went and if any woman lays herself out to do this she generally succeeds
chapter xxxiv   miss pontifex soon found out that ernest did not like games but she saw also that he could hardly be expected to like them
he was perfectly well shaped but unusually devoid of physical strength
he got a fair share of this in after life but it came much later with him than with other boys and at the time of which i am writing he was a mere little skeleton
he wanted something to develop his arms and chest without knocking him about as much as the school games did
to supply this want by some means which should add also to his pleasure was alethea's first anxiety
rowing would have answered every purpose but unfortunately there was no river at roughborough
whatever it was to be it must be something which he should like as much as other boys liked cricket or football and he must think the wish for it to have come originally from himself it was not very easy to find anything that would do but ere long it occurred to her that she might enlist his love of music on her side and asked him one day when he was spending a halfholiday at her house whether he would like her to buy an organ for him to play on
of course the boy said yes then she told him about her grandfather and the organs he had built
it had never entered into his head that he could make one but when he gathered from what his aunt had said that this was not out of the question he rose as eagerly to the bait as she could have desired and wanted to begin learning to saw and plane so that he might make the wooden pipes at once
miss pontifex did not see how she could have hit upon anything more suitable and she liked the idea that he would incidentally get a knowledge of carpentering for she was impressed perhaps foolishly with the wisdom of the german custom which gives every boy a handicraft of some sort
writing to me on this matter she said professions are all very well for those who have connection and interest as well as capital but otherwise they are white elephants
how many men do not you and i know who have talent assiduity excellent good sense straightforwardness every quality in fact which should command success and who yet go on from year to year waiting and hoping against hope for the work which never comes
how indeed is it likely to come unless to those who either are born with interest or who marry in order to get it
ernest's father and mother have no interest and if they had they would not use it
i suppose they will make him a clergyman or try to do soperhaps it is the best thing to do with him for he could buy a living with the money his grandfather left him but there is no knowing what the boy will think of it when the time comes and for aught we know he may insist on going to the backwoods of america as so many other young men are doing now  
 
but anyway he would like making an organ and this could do him no harm so the sooner he began the better
alethea thought it would save trouble in the end if she told her brother and sisterinlaw of this scheme
i do not suppose she wrote that dr skinner will approve very cordially of my attempt to introduce organ building into the curriculum of roughborough but i will see what i can do with him for i have set my heart on owning an organ built by ernest's own hands which he may play on as much as he likes while it remains in my house and which i will lend him permanently as soon as he gets one of his own but which is to be my property for the present inasmuch as i mean to pay for it
this was put in to make it plain to theobald and christina that they should not be out of pocket in the matter
if alethea had been as poor as the misses allaby the reader may guess what ernest's papa and mamma would have said to this proposal but then if she had been as poor as they she would never have made it
they did not like ernest's getting more and more into his aunt's good books still it was perhaps better that he should do so than that she should be driven back upon the john pontifexes
the only thing said theobald which made him hesitate was that the boy might be thrown with low associates later on if he were to be encouraged in his taste for musica taste which theobald had always disliked
he had observed with regret that ernest had ere now shown rather a hankering after low company and he might make acquaintance with those who would corrupt his innocence
christina shuddered at this but when they had aired their scruples sufficiently they felt and when people begin to feel they are invariably going to take what they believe to be the more worldly course that to oppose alethea's proposal would be injuring their son's prospects more than was right so they consented but not too graciously
after a time however christina got used to the idea and then considerations occurred to her which made her throw herself into it with characteristic ardour
if miss pontifex had been a railway stock she might have been said to have been buoyant in the battersby market for some few days buoyant for long together she could never be still for a time there really was an upward movement
christina's mind wandered to the organ itself she seemed to have made it with her own hands there would be no other in england to compare with it for combined sweetness and power
she already heard the famous dr walmisley of cambridge mistaking it for a father smith
it would come no doubt in reality to battersby church which wanted an organ for it must be all nonsense about alethea's wishing to keep it and ernest would not have a house of his own for ever so many years and they could never have it at the rectory
oh no
battersby church was the only proper place for it
of course they would have a grand opening and the bishop would come down and perhaps young figgins might be on a visit to themshe must ask ernest if young figgins had yet left roughboroughhe might even persuade his grandfather lord lonsford to be present
lord lonsford and the bishop and everyone else would then compliment her and dr wesley or dr walmisley who should preside it did not much matter which would say to her my dear mrs pontifex i never yet played upon so remarkable an instrument
then she would give him one of her very sweetest smiles and say she feared he was flattering her on which he would rejoin with some pleasant little trifle about remarkable men the remarkable man being for the moment ernest having invariably had remarkable women for their mothersand so on and so on
the advantage of doing one's praising for oneself is that one can lay it on so thick and exactly in the right places
theobald wrote ernest a short and surly letter a propos of his aunt's intentions in this matter
i will not commit myself he said to an opinion whether anything will come of it this will depend entirely upon your own exertions you have had singular advantages hitherto and your kind aunt is showing every desire to befriend you but you must give greater proof of stability and steadiness of character than you have given yet if this organ matter is not to prove in the end to be only one disappointment the more
i must insist on two things firstly that this new iron in the fire does not distract your attention from your latin and greekthey aren't mine thought ernest and never have beenand secondly that you bring no smell of glue or shavings into the house here if you make any part of the organ during your holidays
ernest was still too young to know how unpleasant a letter he was receiving
he believed the innuendoes contained in it to be perfectly just
he knew he was sadly deficient in perseverance
he liked some things for a little while and then found he did not like them any moreand this was as bad as anything well could be
his father's letter gave him one of his many fits of melancholy over his own worthlessness but the thought of the organ consoled him and he felt sure that here at any rate was something to which he could apply himself steadily without growing tired of it
it was settled that the organ was not to be begun before the christmas holidays were over and that till then ernest should do a little plain carpentering so as to get to know how to use his tools
miss pontifex had a carpenter's bench set up in an outhouse upon her own premises and made terms with the most respectable carpenter in roughborough by which one of his men was to come for a couple of hours twice a week and set ernest on the right way then she discovered she wanted this or that simple piece of work done and gave the boy a commission to do it paying him handsomely as well as finding him in tools and materials
she never gave him a syllable of good advice or talked to him about everything's depending upon his own exertions but she kissed him often and would come into the workshop and act the part of one who took an interest in what was being done so cleverly as ere long to become really interested
what boy would not take kindly to almost anything with such assistance
all boys like making things the exercise of sawing planing and hammering proved exactly what his aunt had wanted to findsomething that should exercise but not too much and at the same time amuse him when ernest's sallow face was flushed with his work and his eyes were sparkling with pleasure he looked quite a different boy from the one his aunt had taken in hand only a few months earlier
his inner self never told him that this was humbug as it did about latin and greek
making stools and drawers was worth living for and after christmas there loomed the organ which was scarcely ever absent from his mind
his aunt let him invite his friends encouraging him to bring those whom her quick sense told her were the most desirable
she smartened him up also in his personal appearance always without preaching to him
indeed she worked wonders during the short time that was allowed her and if her life had been spared i cannot think that my hero would have come under the shadow of that cloud which cast so heavy a gloom over his younger manhood but unfortunately for him his gleam of sunshine was too hot and too brilliant to last and he had many a storm yet to weather before he became fairly happy
for the present however he was supremely so and his aunt was happy and grateful for his happiness the improvement she saw in him and his unrepressed affection for herself
she became fonder of him from day to day in spite of his many faults and almost incredible foolishnesses
it was perhaps on account of these very things that she saw how much he had need of her but at any rate from whatever cause she became strengthened in her determination to be to him in the place of parents and to find in him a son rather than a nephew
but still she made no will
chapter xxxv   all went well for the first part of the following half year
miss pontifex spent the greater part of her holidays in london and i also saw her at roughborough where i spent a few days staying at the swan
i heard all about my godson in whom however i took less interest than i said i did
i took more interest in the stage at that time than in anything else and as for ernest i found him a nuisance for engrossing so much of his aunt's attention and taking her so much from london
the organ was begun and made fair progress during the first two months of the half year
ernest was happier than he had ever been before and was struggling upwards
the best boys took more notice of him for his aunt's sake and he consorted less with those who led him into mischief
but much as miss pontifex had done she could not all at once undo the effect of such surroundings as the boy had had at battersby
much as he feared and disliked his father though he still knew not how much this was he had caught much from him if theobald had been kinder ernest would have modelled himself upon him entirely and ere long would probably have become as thorough a little prig as could have easily been found
fortunately his temper had come to him from his mother who when not frightened and when there was nothing on the horizon which might cross the slightest whim of her husband was an amiable goodnatured woman
if it was not such an awful thing to say of anyone i should say that she meant well
ernest had also inherited his mother's love of building castles in the air andso i suppose it must be calledher vanity
he was very fond of showing off and provided he could attract attention cared little from whom it came nor what it was for
he caught up parrotlike whatever jargon he heard from his elders which he thought was the correct thing and aired it in season and out of season as though it were his own
miss pontifex was old enough and wise enough to know that this is the way in which even the greatest men as a general rule begin to develop and was more pleased with his receptiveness and reproductiveness than alarmed at the things he caught and reproduced
she saw that he was much attached to herself and trusted to this rather than to anything else
she saw also that his conceit was not very profound and that his fits of selfabasement were as extreme as his exaltation had been
his impulsiveness and sanguine trustfulness in anyone who smiled pleasantly at him or indeed was not absolutely unkind to him made her more anxious about him than any other point in his character she saw clearly that he would have to find himself rudely undeceived many a time and oft before he would learn to distinguish friend from foe within reasonable time
it was her perception of this which led her to take the action which she was so soon called upon to take
her health was for the most part excellent and she had never had a serious illness in her life
one morning however soon after easter  she awoke feeling seriously unwell
for some little time there had been a talk of fever in the neighbourhood but in those days the precautions that ought to be taken against the spread of infection were not so well understood as now and nobody did anything
in a day or two it became plain that miss pontifex had got an attack of typhoid fever and was dangerously ill  on this she sent off a messenger to town and desired him not to return without her lawyer and myself
we arrived on the afternoon of the day on which we had been summoned and found her still free from delirium indeed the cheery way in which she received us made it difficult to think she could be in danger
she at once explained her wishes which had reference as i expected to her nephew and repeated the substance of what i have already referred to as her main source of uneasiness concerning him
then she begged me by our long and close intimacy by the suddenness of the danger that had fallen on her and her powerlessness to avert it to undertake what she said she well knew if she died would be an unpleasant and invidious trust
she wanted to leave the bulk of her money ostensibly to me but in reality to her nephew so that i should hold it in trust for him till he was twentyeight years old but neither he nor anyone else except her lawyer and myself was to know anything about it
she would leave  pounds in other legacies and  pounds to ernestwhich by the time he was twentyeight would have accumulated to say  pounds
sell out the debentures she said where the money now isand put it into midland ordinary
let him make his mistakes she said upon the money his grandfather left him
i am no prophet but even i can see that it will take that boy many years to see things as his neighbours see them
he will get no help from his father and mother who would never forgive him for his good luck if i left him the money outright i daresay i am wrong but i think he will have to lose the greater part or all of what he has before he will know how to keep what he will get from me
supposing he went bankrupt before he was twentyeight years old the money was to be mine absolutely but she could trust me she said to hand it over to ernest in due time
if she continued i am mistaken the worst that can happen is that he will come into a larger sum at twentyeight instead of a smaller sum at say twentythree for i would never trust him with it earlier andif he knows nothing about it he will not be unhappy for the want of it
she begged me to take  pounds in return for the trouble i should have in taking charge of the boy's estate and as a sign of the testatrix's hope that i would now and again look after him while he was still young
the remaining  pounds i was to pay in legacies and annuities to friends and servants
in vain both her lawyer and myself remonstrated with her on the unusual and hazardous nature of this arrangement
we told her that sensible people will not take a more sanguine view concerning human nature than the courts of chancery do
we said in fact everything that anyone else would say
she admitted everything but urged that her time was short that nothing would induce her to leave her money to her nephew in the usual way
it is an unusually foolish will she said but he is an unusually foolish boy and she smiled quite merrily at her little sally
like all the rest of her family she was very stubborn when her mind was made up
so the thing was done as she wished it
no provision was made for either my death or ernest'smiss pontifex had settled it that we were neither of us going to die and was too ill to go into details she was so anxious moreover to sign her will while still able to do so that we had practically no alternative but to do as she told us
if she recovered we could see things put on a more satisfactory footing and further discussion would evidently impair her chances of recovery it seemed then only too likely that it was a case of this will or no will at all
when the will was signed i wrote a letter in duplicate saying that i held all miss pontifex had left me in trust for ernest except as regards  pounds but that he was not to come into the bequest and was to know nothing whatever about it directly or indirectly till he was twenty eight years old and if he was bankrupt before he came into it the money was to be mine absolutely
at the foot of each letter miss pontifex wrote the above was my understanding when i made my will and then signed her name
the solicitor and his clerk witnessed i kept one copy myself and handed the other to miss pontifex's solicitor
when all this had been done she became more easy in her mind
she talked principally about her nephew
don't scold him she said if he is volatile and continually takes things up only to throw them down again
how can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise
a man's profession she said and here she gave one of her wicked little laughs is not like his wife which he must take once for all for better for worse without proof beforehand
let him go here and there and learn his truest liking by finding out what after all he catches himself turning to most habituallythen let him stick to this but i daresay ernest will be forty or five and forty before he settles down
then all his previous infidelities will work together to him for good if he is the boy i hope he is
above all she continued do not let him work up to his full strength except once or twice in his lifetime nothing is well done nor worth doing unless take it all round it has come pretty easily
theobald and christina would give him a pinch of salt and tell him to put it on the tails of the seven deadly virtueshere she laughed again in her old manner at once so mocking and so sweeti think if he likes pancakes he had perhaps better eat them on shrove tuesday but this is enough
these were the last coherent words she spoke
from that time she grew continually worse and was never free from delirium till her deathwhich took place less than a fortnight afterwards to the inexpressible grief of those who knew and loved her
chapter xxxvi   letters had been written to miss pontifex's brothers and sisters and one and all came posthaste to roughborough
before they arrived the poor lady was already delirious and for the sake of her own peace at the last i am half glad she never recovered consciousness
i had known these people all their lives as none can know each other but those who have played together as children i knew how they had all of themperhaps theobald least but all of them more or lessmade her life a burden to her until the death of her father had made her her own mistress and i was displeased at their coming one after the other to roughborough and inquiring whether their sister had recovered consciousness sufficiently to be able to see them
it was known that she had sent for me on being taken ill and that i remained at roughborough and i own i was angered by the mingled air of suspicion defiance and inquisitiveness with which they regarded me
they would all except theobald i believe have cut me downright if they had not believed me to know something they wanted to know themselves and might have some chance of learning from mefor it was plain i had been in some way concerned with the making of their sister's will
none of them suspected what the ostensible nature of this would be but i think they feared miss pontifex was about to leave money for public uses
john said to me in his blandest manner that he fancied he remembered to have heard his sister say that she thought of leaving money to found a college for the relief of dramatic authors in distress to this i made no rejoinder and i have no doubt his suspicions were deepened
when the end came i got miss pontifex's solicitor to write and tell her brothers and sisters how she had left her money they were not unnaturally furious and went each to his or her separate home without attending the funeral and without paying any attention to myself
this was perhaps the kindest thing they could have done by me for their behaviour made me so angry that i became almost reconciled to alethea's will out of pleasure at the anger it had aroused
but for this i should have felt the will keenly as having been placed by it in the position which of all others i had been most anxious to avoid and as having saddled me with a very heavy responsibility
still it was impossible for me to escape and i could only let things take their course
miss pontifex had expressed a wish to be buried at paleham in the course of the next few days i therefore took the body thither
i had not been to paleham since the death of my father some six years earlier
i had often wished to go there but had shrunk from doing so though my sister had been two or three times
i could not bear to see the house which had been my home for so many years of my life in the hands of strangers to ring ceremoniously at a bell which i had never yet pulled except as a boy in jest to feel that i had nothing to do with a garden in which i had in childhood gathered so many a nosegay and which had seemed my own for many years after i had reached man's estate to see the rooms bereft of every familiar feature and made so unfamiliar in spite of their familiarity
had there been any sufficient reason i should have taken these things as a matter of course and should no doubt have found them much worse in anticipation than in reality but as there had been no special reason why i should go to paleham i had hitherto avoided doing so
now however my going was a necessity and i confess i never felt more subdued than i did on arriving there with the dead playmate of my childhood
i found the village more changed than i had expected
the railway had come there and a brand new yellow brick station was on the site of old mr and mrs pontifex's cottage
nothing but the carpenter's shop was now standing
i saw many faces i knew but even in six years they seemed to have grown wonderfully older
some of the very old were dead and the old were getting very old in their stead
i felt like the changeling in the fairy story who came back after a seven years' sleep
everyone seemed glad to see me though i had never given them particular cause to be so and everyone who remembered old mr and mrs pontifex spoke warmly of them and were pleased at their granddaughter's wishing to be laid near them
entering the churchyard and standing in the twilight of a gusty cloudy evening on the spot close beside old mrs pontifex's grave which i had chosen for alethea's i thought of the many times that she who would lie there henceforth and i who must surely lie one day in some such another place though when and where i knew not had romped over this very spot as childish lovers together
next morning i followed her to the grave and in due course set up a plain upright slab to her memory as like as might be to those over the graves of her grandmother and grandfather
i gave the dates and places of her birth and death but added nothing except that this stone was set up by one who had known and loved her
knowing how fond she had been of music i had been half inclined at one time to inscribe a few bars of music if i could find any which seemed suitable to her character but i knew how much she would have disliked anything singular in connection with her tombstone and did not do it
before however i had come to this conclusion i had thought that ernest might be able to help me to the right thing and had written to him upon the subject
the following is the answer i received     dear godpapai send you the best bit i can think of it is the    subject of the last of handel's six grand fugues and goes thus     music score     it would do better for a man especially for an old man who was very    sorry for things than for a woman but i cannot think of anything    better if you do not like it for aunt alethea i shall keep it for    myselfyour affectionate godson ernest pontifex
was this the little lad who could get sweeties for twopence but not for twopencehalfpenny
dear dear me i thought to myself how these babes and sucklings do give us the goby surely
choosing his own epitaph at fifteen as for a man who had been very sorry for things and such a strain as thatwhy it might have done for leonardo da vinci himself
then i set the boy down as a conceited young jackanapes which no doubt he wasbut so are a great many other young people of ernest's age
chapter xxxvii   if theobald and christina had not been too well pleased when miss pontifex first took ernest in hand they were still less so when the connection between the two was interrupted so prematurely
they said they had made sure from what their sister had said that she was going to make ernest her heir
i do not think she had given them so much as a hint to this effect
theobald indeed gave ernest to understand that she had done so in a letter which will be given shortly but if theobald wanted to make himself disagreeable a trifle light as air would forthwith assume in his imagination whatever form was most convenient to him
i do not think they had even made up their minds what alethea was to do with her money before they knew of her being at the point of death and as i have said already if they had thought it likely that ernest would be made heir over their own heads without their having at any rate a life interest in the bequest they would have soon thrown obstacles in the way of further intimacy between aunt and nephew
this however did not bar their right to feeling aggrieved now that neither they nor ernest had taken anything at all and they could profess disappointment on their boy's behalf which they would have been too proud to admit upon their own
in fact it was only amiable of them to be disappointed under these circumstances
christina said that the will was simply fraudulent and was convinced that it could be upset if she and theobald went the right way to work
theobald she said should go before the lord chancellor not in full court but in chambers where he could explain the whole matter or perhaps it would be even better if she were to go herselfand i dare not trust myself to describe the reverie to which this last idea gave rise
i believe in the end theobald died and the lord chancellor who had become a widower a few weeks earlier made her an offer which however she firmly but not ungratefully declined she should ever she said continue to think of him as a friendat this point the cook came in saying the butcher had called and what would she please to order
i think theobald must have had an idea that there was something behind the bequest to me but he said nothing about it to christina
he was angry and felt wronged because he could not get at alethea to give her a piece of his mind any more than he had been able to get at his father
it is so mean of people he exclaimed to himself to inflict an injury of this sort and then shirk facing those whom they have injured let us hope that at any rate they and i may meet in heaven
but of this he was doubtful for when people had done so great a wrong as this it was hardly to be supposed that they would go to heaven at alland as for his meeting them in another place the idea never so much as entered his mind
one so angry and of late so little used to contradiction might be trusted however to avenge himself upon someone and theobald had long since developed the organ by means of which he might vent spleen with least risk and greatest satisfaction to himself
this organ it may be guessed was nothing else than ernest to ernest therefore he proceeded to unburden himself not personally but by letter
you ought to know he wrote that your aunt alethea had given your mother and me to understand that it was her wish to make you her heirin the event of course of your conducting yourself in such a manner as to give her confidence in you as a matter of fact however she has left you nothing and the whole of her property has gone to your godfather mr overton
your mother and i are willing to hope that if she had lived longer you would yet have succeeded in winning her good opinion but it is too late to think of this now
the carpentering and organbuilding must at once be discontinued
i never believed in the project and have seen no reason to alter my original opinion
i am not sorry for your own sake that it is to be at an end nor i am sure will you regret it yourself in after years
a few words more as regards your own prospects
you have as i believe you know a small inheritance which is yours legally under your grandfather's will
this bequest was made inadvertently and i believe entirely through a misunderstanding on the lawyer's part
the bequest was probably intended not to take effect till after the death of your mother and myself nevertheless as the will is actually worded it will now be at your command if you live to be twentyone years old
from this however large deductions must be made
there will be legacy duty and i do not know whether i am not entitled to deduct the expenses of your education and maintenance from birth to your coming of age i shall not in all likelihood insist on this right to the full if you conduct yourself properly but a considerable sum should certainly be deducted there will therefore remain very littlesay  pounds or  pounds at the outside as what will be actually yoursbut the strictest account shall be rendered you in due time
this let me warn you most seriously is all that you must expect from me even ernest saw that it was not from theobald at all at any rate till after my death which for aught any of us know may be yet many years distant
it is not a large sum but it is sufficient if supplemented by steadiness and earnestness of purpose
your mother and i gave you the name ernest hoping that it would remind you continually of but i really cannot copy more of this effusion
it was all the same old will shaking game and came practically to this that ernest was no good and that if he went on as he was going on now he would probably have to go about the streets begging without any shoes or stockings soon after he had left school or at any rate college and that he theobald and christina were almost too good for this world altogether
after he had written this theobald felt quite goodnatured and sent to the mrs thompson of the moment even more soup and wine than her usual not illiberal allowance
ernest was deeply passionately upset by his father's letter to think that even his dear aunt the one person of his relations whom he really loved should have turned against him and thought badly of him after all
this was the unkindest cut of all
in the hurry of her illness miss pontifex while thinking only of his welfare had omitted to make such small present mention of him as would have made his father's innuendoes stingless and her illness being infectious she had not seen him after its nature was known
i myself did not know of theobald's letter nor think enough about my godson to guess what might easily be his state
it was not till many years afterwards that i found theobald's letter in the pocket of an old portfolio which ernest had used at school and in which other old letters and school documents were collected which i have used in this book
he had forgotten that he had it but told me when he saw it that he remembered it as the first thing that made him begin to rise against his father in a rebellion which he recognised as righteous though he dared not openly avow it
not the least serious thing was that it would he feared be his duty to give up the legacy his grandfather had left him for if it was his only through a mistake how could he keep it
during the rest of the half year ernest was listless and unhappy
he was very fond of some of his schoolfellows but afraid of those whom he believed to be better than himself and prone to idealise everyone into being his superior except those who were obviously a good deal beneath him
he held himself much too cheap and because he was without that physical strength and vigour which he so much coveted and also because he knew he shirked his lessons he believed that he was without anything which could deserve the name of a good quality he was naturally bad and one of those for whom there was no place for repentance though he sought it even with tears
so he shrank out of sight of those whom in his boyish way he idolised never for a moment suspecting that he might have capacities to the full as high as theirs though of a different kind and fell in more with those who were reputed of the baser sort with whom he could at any rate be upon equal terms
before the end of the half year he had dropped from the estate to which he had been raised during his aunt's stay at roughborough and his old dejection varied however with bursts of conceit rivalling those of his mother resumed its sway over him
pontifex said dr skinner who had fallen upon him in hall one day like a moral landslip before he had time to escape do you never laugh
do you always look so preternaturally grave
the doctor had not meant to be unkind but the boy turned crimson and escaped
there was one place only where he was happy and that was in the old church of st michael when his friend the organist was practising
about this time cheap editions of the great oratorios began to appear and ernest got them all as soon as they were published he would sometimes sell a schoolbook to a secondhand dealer and buy a number or two of the messiah or the creation or elijah with the proceeds
this was simply cheating his papa and mamma but ernest was falling low againor thought he wasand he wanted the music much and the sallust or whatever it was little
sometimes the organist would go home leaving his keys with ernest so that he could play by himself and lock up the organ and the church in time to get back for calling over
at other times while his friend was playing he would wander round the church looking at the monuments and the old stained glass windows enchanted as regards both ears and eyes at once
once the old rector got hold of him as he was watching a new window being put in which the rector had bought in germanythe work it was supposed of albert durer
he questioned ernest and finding that he was fond of music he said in his old trembling voice for he was over eighty then you should have known dr burney who wrote the history of music
i knew him exceedingly well when i was a young man
that made ernest's heart beat for he knew that dr burney when a boy at school at chester used to break bounds that he might watch handel smoking his pipe in the exchange coffee houseand now he was in the presence of one who if he had not seen handel himself had at least seen those who had seen him
these were oases in his desert but as a general rule the boy looked thin and pale and as though he had a secret which depressed him which no doubt he had but for which i cannot blame him
he rose in spite of himself higher in the school but fell ever into deeper and deeper disgrace with the masters and did not gain in the opinion of those boys about whom he was persuaded that they could assuredly never know what it was to have a secret weighing upon their minds
this was what ernest felt so keenly he did not much care about the boys who liked him and idolised some who kept him as far as possible at a distance but this is pretty much the case with all boys everywhere
at last things reached a crisis below which they could not very well go for at the end of the half year but one after his aunt's death ernest brought back a document in his portmanteau which theobald stigmatised as infamous and outrageous
i need hardly say i am alluding to his school bill
this document was always a source of anxiety to ernest for it was gone into with scrupulous care and he was a good deal crossexamined about it
he would sometimes write in for articles necessary for his education such as a portfolio or a dictionary and sell the same as i have explained in order to eke out his pocket money probably to buy either music or tobacco
these frauds were sometimes as ernest thought in imminent danger of being discovered and it was a load off his breast when the crossexamination was safely over
this time theobald had made a great fuss about the extras but had grudgingly passed them it was another matter however with the character and the moral statistics with which the bill concluded
the page on which these details were to be found was as follows     report of the conduct and progress of ernest pontifex

chapter xxxviii   ernest was thus in disgrace from the beginning of the holidays but an incident soon occurred which led him into delinquencies compared with which all his previous sins were venial
among the servants at the rectory was a remarkably pretty girl named ellen
she came from devonshire and was the daughter of a fisherman who had been drowned when she was a child
her mother set up a small shop in the village where her husband had lived and just managed to make a living
ellen remained with her till she was fourteen when she first went out to service
four years later when she was about eighteen but so well grown that she might have passed for twenty she had been strongly recommended to christina who was then in want of a housemaid and had now been at battersby about twelve months
as i have said the girl was remarkably pretty she looked the perfection of health and good temper indeed there was a serene expression upon her face which captivated almost all who saw her she looked as if matters had always gone well with her and were always going to do so and as if no conceivable combination of circumstances could put her for long together out of temper either with herself or with anyone else
her complexion was clear but high her eyes were grey and beautifully shaped her lips were full and restful with something of an egyptian sphinxlike character about them
when i learned that she came from devonshire i fancied i saw a strain of far away egyptian blood in her for i had heard though i know not what foundation there was for the story that the egyptians made settlements on the coast of devonshire and cornwall long before the romans conquered britain
her hair was a rich brown and her figureof about the middle heightperfect but erring if at all on the side of robustness
altogether she was one of those girls about whom one is inclined to wonder how they can remain unmarried a week or a day longer
her face as indeed faces generally are though i grant they lie sometimes was a fair index to her disposition
she was good nature itself and everyone in the house not excluding i believe even theobald himself after a fashion was fond of her
as for christina she took the very warmest interest in her and used to have her into the diningroom twice a week and prepare her for confirmation for by some accident she had never been confirmed by explaining to her the geography of palestine and the routes taken by st paul on his various journeys in asia minor
when bishop treadwell did actually come down to battersby and hold a confirmation there christina had her wish he slept at battersby and she had a grand dinner party for him and called him my lord several times he was so much struck with her pretty face and modest demeanour when he laid his hands upon her that he asked christina about her
when she replied that ellen was one of her own servants the bishop seemed so she thought or chose to think quite pleased that so pretty a girl should have found so exceptionally good a situation
ernest used to get up early during the holidays so that he might play the piano before breakfast without disturbing his papa and mammaor rather perhaps without being disturbed by them
ellen would generally be there sweeping the drawingroom floor and dusting while he was playing and the boy who was ready to make friends with most people soon became very fond of her
he was not as a general rule sensitive to the charms of the fair sex indeed he had hardly been thrown in with any women except his aunts allaby and his aunt alethea his mother his sister charlotte and mrs jay sometimes also he had had to take off his hat to the miss skinners and had felt as if he should sink into the earth on doing so but his shyness had worn off with ellen and the pair had become fast friends
perhaps it was well that ernest was not at home for very long together but as yet his affection though hearty was quite platonic
he was not only innocent but deplorablyi might even say guiltilyinnocent
his preference was based upon the fact that ellen never scolded him but was always smiling and good tempered besides she used to like to hear him play and this gave him additional zest in playing
the morning access to the piano was indeed the one distinct advantage which the holidays had in ernest's eyes for at school he could not get at a piano except quasi surreptitiously at the shop of mr pearsall the musicseller
on returning this midsummer he was shocked to find his favourite looking pale and ill  all her good spirits had left her the roses had fled from her cheek and she seemed on the point of going into a decline
she said she was unhappy about her mother whose health was failing and was afraid she was herself not long for this world
christina of course noticed the change
i have often remarked she said that those very freshcoloured healthylooking girls are the first to break up
i have given her calomel and james's powders repeatedly and though she does not like it i think i must show her to dr martin when he next comes here
very well my dear said theobald and so next time dr martin came ellen was sent for
dr martin soon discovered what would probably have been apparent to christina herself if she had been able to conceive of such an ailment in connection with a servant who lived under the same roof as theobald and herselfthe purity of whose married life should have preserved all unmarried people who came near them from any taint of mischief
when it was discovered that in three or four months more ellen would become a mother christina's natural good nature would have prompted her to deal as leniently with the case as she could if she had not been panicstricken lest any mercy on her and theobald's part should be construed into toleration however partial of so great a sin hereon she dashed off into the conviction that the only thing to do was to pay ellen her wages and pack her off on the instant bag and baggage out of the house which purity had more especially and particularly singled out for its abiding city
when she thought of the fearful contamination which ellen's continued presence even for a week would occasion she could not hesitate
then came the questionhorrid thoughtas to who was the partner of ellen's guilt
was it could it be her own son her darling ernest
ernest was getting a big boy now
she could excuse any young woman for taking a fancy to him as for himself why she was sure he was behind no young man of his age in appreciation of the charms of a nicelooking young woman
so long as he was innocent she did not mind this but oh if he were guilty
she could not bear to think of it and yet it would be mere cowardice not to look such a matter in the faceher hope was in the lord and she was ready to bear cheerfully and make the best of any suffering he might think fit to lay upon her
that the baby must be either a boy or girlthis much at any rate was clear
no less clear was it that the child if a boy would resemble theobald and if a girl herself
resemblance whether of body or mind generally leaped over a generation
the guilt of the parents must not be shared by the innocent offspring of shameoh
noand such a child as this would be 
  she was off in one of her reveries at once
the child was in the act of being consecrated archbishop of canterbury when theobald came in from a visit in the parish and was told of the shocking discovery
christina said nothing about ernest and i believe was more than half angry when the blame was laid upon other shoulders
she was easily consoled however and fell back on the double reflection firstly that her son was pure and secondly that she was quite sure he would not have been so had it not been for his religious convictions which had held him backas of course it was only to be expected they would
theobald agreed that no time must be lost in paying ellen her wages and packing her off
so this was done and less than two hours after dr martin had entered the house ellen was sitting beside john the coachman with her face muffled up so that it could not be seen weeping bitterly as she was being driven to the station
chapter xxxix   ernest had been out all the morning but came in to the yard of the rectory from the spinney behind the house just as ellen's things were being put into the carriage
he thought it was ellen whom he then saw get into the carriage but as her face had been hidden by her handkerchief he had not been able to see plainly who it was and dismissed the idea as improbable
he went to the backkitchen window at which the cook was standing peeling the potatoes for dinner and found her crying bitterly
ernest was much distressed for he liked the cook and of course wanted to know what all the matter was who it was that had just gone off in the pony carriage and why
the cook told him it was ellen but said that no earthly power should make it cross her lips why it was she was going away when however ernest took her au pied de la lettre and asked no further questions she told him all about it after extorting the most solemn promises of secrecy
it took ernest some minutes to arrive at the facts of the case but when he understood them he leaned against the pump which stood near the back kitchen window and mingled his tears with the cook's
then his blood began to boil within him
he did not see that after all his father and mother could have done much otherwise than they actually did
they might perhaps have been less precipitate and tried to keep the matter a little more quiet but this would not have been easy nor would it have mended things very materially
the bitter fact remains that if a girl does certain things she must do them at her peril no matter how young and pretty she is nor to what temptation she has succumbed
this is the way of the world and as yet there has been no help found for it
ernest could only see what he gathered from the cook namely that his favourite ellen was being turned adrift with a matter of three pounds in her pocket to go she knew not where and to do she knew not what and that she had said she should hang or drown herself which the boy implicitly believed she would
with greater promptitude than he had shown yet he reckoned up his money and found he had two shillings and threepence at his command there was his knife which might sell for a shilling and there was the silver watch his aunt alethea had given him shortly before she died
the carriage had been gone now a full quarter of an hour and it must have got some distance ahead but he would do his best to catch it up and there were short cuts which would perhaps give him a chance
he was off at once and from the top of the hill just past the rectory paddock he could see the carriage looking very small on a bit of road which showed perhaps a mile and a half in front of him
one of the most popular amusements at roughborough was an institution called the houndsmore commonly known elsewhere as hare and hounds but in this case the hare was a couple of boys who were called foxes and boys are so particular about correctness of nomenclature where their sports are concerned that i dare not say they played hare and hounds these were the hounds and that was all
ernest's want of muscular strength did not tell against him here there was no jostling up against boys who though neither older nor taller than he were yet more robustly built if it came to mere endurance he was as good as any one else so when his carpentering was stopped he had naturally taken to the hounds as his favourite amusement
his lungs thus exercised had become developed and as a run of six or seven miles across country was not more than he was used to he did not despair by the help of the short cuts of overtaking the carriage or at the worst of catching ellen at the station before the train left
so he ran and ran and ran till his first wind was gone and his second came and he could breathe more easily
never with the hounds had he run so fast and with so few breaks as now but with all his efforts and the help of the short cuts he did not catch up the carriage and would probably not have done so had not john happened to turn his head and seen him running and making signs for the carriage to stop a quarter of a mile off
he was now about five miles from home and was nearly done up
he was crimson with his exertion covered with dust and with his trousers and coat sleeves a trifle short for him he cut a poor figure enough as he thrust on ellen his watch his knife and the little money he had
the one thing he implored of her was not to do those dreadful things which she threatenedfor his sake if for no other reason
ellen at first would not hear of taking anything from him but the coachman who was from the north country sided with ernest
take it my lass he said kindly take what thou canst get whiles thou canst get it as for master ernest herehe has run well after thee therefore let him give thee what he is minded
ellen did what she was told and the two parted with many tears the girl's last words being that she should never forget him and that they should meet again hereafter she was sure they should and then she would repay him
then ernest got into a field by the roadside flung himself on the grass and waited under the shadow of a hedge till the carriage should pass on its return from the station and pick him up for he was dead beat
thoughts which had already occurred to him with some force now came more strongly before him and he saw that he had got himself into one messor rather into halfadozen messesthe more
in the first place he should be late for dinner and this was one of the offences on which theobald had no mercy
also he should have to say where he had been and there was a danger of being found out if he did not speak the truth
not only this but sooner or later it must come out that he was no longer possessed of the beautiful watch which his dear aunt had given himand what pray had he done with it or how had he lost it
the reader will know very well what he ought to have done
he should have gone straight home and if questioned should have said i have been running after the carriage to catch our housemaid ellen whom i am very fond of i have given her my watch my knife and all my pocket money so that i have now no pocket money at all and shall probably ask you for some more sooner than i otherwise might have done and you will also have to buy me a new watch and a knife
but then fancy the consternation which such an announcement would have occasioned
fancy the scowl and flashing eyes of the infuriated theobald
you unprincipled young scoundrel he would exclaim do you mean to vilify your own parents by implying that they have dealt harshly by one whose profligacy has disgraced their house
or he might take it with one of those sallies of sarcastic calm of which he believed himself to be a master
very well ernest very well i shall say nothing you can please yourself you are not yet twentyone but pray act as if you were your own master your poor aunt doubtless gave you the watch that you might fling it away upon the first improper character you came across i think i can now understand however why she did not leave you her money and after all your godfather may just as well have it as the kind of people on whom you would lavish it if it were yours
then his mother would burst into tears and implore him to repent and seek the things belonging to his peace while there was yet time by falling on his knees to theobald and assuring him of his unfailing love for him as the kindest and tenderest father in the universe
ernest could do all this just as well as they could and now as he lay on the grass speeches some one or other of which was as certain to come as the sun to set kept running in his head till they confuted the idea of telling the truth by reducing it to an absurdity
truth might be heroic but it was not within the range of practical domestic politics
having settled then that he was to tell a lie what lie should he tell
should he say he had been robbed
he had enough imagination to know that he had not enough imagination to carry him out here
young as he was his instinct told him that the best liar is he who makes the smallest amount of lying go the longest waywho husbands it too carefully to waste it where it can be dispensed with
the simplest course would be to say that he had lost the watch and was late for dinner because he had been looking for it
he had been out for a long walkhe chose the line across the fields that he had actually takenand the weather being very hot he had taken off his coat and waistcoat in carrying them over his arm his watch his money and his knife had dropped out of them
he had got nearly home when he found out his loss and had run back as fast as he could looking along the line he had followed till at last he had given it up seeing the carriage coming back from the station he had let it pick him up and bring him home
this covered everything the running and all for his face still showed that he must have been running hard the only question was whether he had been seen about the rectory by any but the servants for a couple of hours or so before ellen had gone and this he was happy to believe was not the case for he had been out except during his few minutes' interview with the cook
his father had been out in the parish his mother had certainly not come across him and his brother and sister had also been out with the governess
he knew he could depend upon the cook and the other servantsthe coachman would see to this on the whole therefore both he and the coachman thought the story as proposed by ernest would about meet the requirements of the case
chapter xl   when ernest got home and sneaked in through the back door he heard his father's voice in its angriest tones inquiring whether master ernest had already returned
he felt as jack must have felt in the story of jack and the bean stalk when from the oven in which he was hidden he heard the ogre ask his wife what young children she had got for his supper
with much courage and as the event proved with not less courage than discretion he took the bull by the horns and announced himself at once as having just come in after having met with a terrible misfortune
little by little he told his story and though theobald stormed somewhat at his incredible folly and carelessness he got off better than he expected
theobald and christina had indeed at first been inclined to connect his absence from dinner with ellen's dismissal but on finding it clear as theobald saideverything was always clear with theobaldthat ernest had not been in the house all the morning and could therefore have known nothing of what had happened he was acquitted on this account for once in a way without a stain upon his character
perhaps theobald was in a good temper he may have seen from the paper that morning that his stocks had been rising it may have been this or twenty other things but whatever it was he did not scold so much as ernest had expected and seeing the boy look exhausted and believing him to be much grieved at the loss of his watch theobald actually prescribed a glass of wine after his dinner which strange to say did not choke him but made him see things more cheerfully than was usual with him
that night when he said his prayers he inserted a few paragraphs to the effect that he might not be discovered and that things might go well with ellen but he was anxious and ill at ease
his guilty conscience pointed out to him a score of weak places in his story through any one of which detection might even yet easily enter
next day and for many days afterwards he fled when no man was pursuing and trembled each time he heard his father's voice calling for him
he had already so many causes of anxiety that he could stand little more and in spite of all his endeavours to look cheerful even his mother could see that something was preying upon his mind
then the idea returned to her that after all her son might not be innocent in the ellen matterand this was so interesting that she felt bound to get as near the truth as she could
come here my poor palefaced heavyeyed boy she said to him one day in her kindest manner come and sit down by me and we will have a little quiet confidential talk together will we not
the boy went mechanically to the sofa
whenever his mother wanted what she called a confidential talk with him she always selected the sofa as the most suitable ground on which to open her campaign
all mothers do this the sofa is to them what the diningroom is to fathers
in the present case the sofa was particularly well adapted for a strategic purpose being an oldfashioned one with a high back mattress bolsters and cushions
once safely penned into one of its deep corners it was like a dentist's chair not too easy to get out of again
here she could get at him better to pull him about if this should seem desirable or if she thought fit to cry she could bury her head in the sofa cushion and abandon herself to an agony of grief which seldom failed of its effect
none of her favourite manoeuvres were so easily adopted in her usual seat the armchair on the right hand side of the fireplace and so well did her son know from his mother's tone that this was going to be a sofa conversation that he took his place like a lamb as soon as she began to speak and before she could reach the sofa herself
my dearest boy began his mother taking hold of his hand and placing it within her own promise me never to be afraid either of your dear papa or of me promise me this my dear as you love me promise it to me and she kissed him again and again and stroked his hair
but with her other hand she still kept hold of his she had got him and she meant to keep him
the lad hung down his head and promised
what else could he do
you know there is no one dear dear ernest who loves you so much as your papa and i do no one who watches so carefully over your interests or who is so anxious to enter into all your little joys and troubles as we are but my dearest boy it grieves me to think sometimes that you have not that perfect love for and confidence in us which you ought to have
you know my darling that it would be as much our pleasure as our duty to watch over the development of your moral and spiritual nature but alas
you will not let us see your moral and spiritual nature
at times we are almost inclined to doubt whether you have a moral and spiritual nature at all
of your inner life my dear we know nothing beyond such scraps as we can glean in spite of you from little things which escape you almost before you know that you have said them
the boy winced at this
it made him feel hot and uncomfortable all over
he knew well how careful he ought to be and yet do what he could from time to time his forgetfulness of the part betrayed him into unreserve
his mother saw that he winced and enjoyed the scratch she had given him
had she felt less confident of victory she had better have foregone the pleasure of touching as it were the eyes at the end of the snail's horns in order to enjoy seeing the snail draw them in againbut she knew that when she had got him well down into the sofa and held his hand she had the enemy almost absolutely at her mercy and could do pretty much what she liked
papa does not feel she continued that you love him with that fulness and unreserve which would prompt you to have no concealment from him and to tell him everything freely and fearlessly as your most loving earthly friend next only to your heavenly father
perfect love as we know casteth out fear your father loves you perfectly my darling but he does not feel as though you loved him perfectly in return
if you fear him it is because you do not love him as he deserves and i know it sometimes cuts him to the very heart to think that he has earned from you a deeper and more willing sympathy than you display towards him
oh ernest ernest do not grieve one who is so good and noblehearted by conduct which i can call by no other name than ingratitude
ernest could never stand being spoken to in this way by his mother for he still believed that she loved him and that he was fond of her and had a friend in herup to a certain point
but his mother was beginning to come to the end of her tether she had played the domestic confidence trick upon him times without number already
over and over again had she wheedled from him all she wanted to know and afterwards got him into the most horrible scrape by telling the whole to theobald
ernest had remonstrated more than once upon these occasions and had pointed out to his mother how disastrous to him his confidences had been but christina had always joined issue with him and showed him in the clearest possible manner that in each case she had been right and that he could not reasonably complain
generally it was her conscience that forbade her to be silent and against this there was no appeal for we are all bound to follow the dictates of our conscience
ernest used to have to recite a hymn about conscience
it was to the effect that if you did not pay attention to its voice it would soon leave off speaking
my mamma's conscience has not left off speaking said ernest to one of his chums at roughborough it's always jabbering
when a boy has once spoken so disrespectfully as this about his mother's conscience it is practically all over between him and her
ernest through sheer force of habit of the sofa and of the return of the associated ideas was still so moved by the siren's voice as to yearn to sail towards her and fling himself into her arms but it would not do there were other associated ideas that returned also and the mangled bones of too many murdered confessions were lying whitening round the skirts of his mother's dress to allow him by any possibility to trust her further
so he hung his head and looked sheepish but kept his own counsel
i see my dearest continued his mother either that i am mistaken and that there is nothing on your mind or that you will not unburden yourself to me but oh ernest tell me at least this much is there nothing that you repent of nothing which makes you unhappy in connection with that miserable girl ellen
ernest's heart failed him
i am a dead boy now he said to himself
he had not the faintest conception what his mother was driving at and thought she suspected about the watch but he held his ground
i do not believe he was much more of a coward than his neighbours only he did not know that all sensible people are cowards when they are off their beat or when they think they are going to be roughly handled
i believe that if the truth were known it would be found that even the valiant st michael himself tried hard to shirk his famous combat with the dragon he pretended not to see all sorts of misconduct on the dragon's part shut his eyes to the eating up of i do not know how many hundreds of men women and children whom he had promised to protect allowed himself to be publicly insulted a dozen times over without resenting it and in the end when even an angel could stand it no longer he shillyshallied and temporised an unconscionable time before he would fix the day and hour for the encounter
as for the actual combat it was much such another wurrawurra as mrs allaby had had with the young man who had in the end married her eldest daughter till after a time behold there was the dragon lying dead while he was himself alive and not very seriously hurt after all
i do not know what you mean mamma exclaimed ernest anxiously and more or less hurriedly
his mother construed his manner into indignation at being suspected and being rather frightened herself she turned tail and scuttled off as fast as her tongue could carry her
oh
she said i see by your tone that you are innocent
oh
oh
how i thank my heavenly father for this may he for his dear son's sake keep you always pure
your father my dearhere she spoke hurriedly but gave him a searching look was as pure as a spotless angel when he came to me
like him always be selfdenying truly truthful both in word and deed never forgetful whose son and grandson you are nor of the name we gave you of the sacred stream in whose waters your sins were washed out of you through the blood and blessing of christ etc
but ernest cut thisi will not say shortbut a great deal shorter than it would have been if christina had had her say out by extricating himself from his mamma's embrace and showing a clean pair of heels
as he got near the purlieus of the kitchen where he was more at ease he heard his father calling for his mother and again his guilty conscience rose against him
he has found all out now it cried and he is going to tell mammathis time i am done for
but there was nothing in it his father only wanted the key of the cellaret
then ernest slunk off into a coppice or spinney behind the rectory paddock and consoled himself with a pipe of tobacco
here in the wood with the summer sun streaming through the trees and a book and his pipe the boy forgot his cares and had an interval of that rest without which i verily believe his life would have been insupportable
of course ernest was made to look for his lost property and a reward was offered for it but it seemed he had wandered a good deal off the path thinking to find a lark's nest more than once and looking for a watch and purse on battersby piewipes was very like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay besides it might have been found and taken by some tramp or by a magpie of which there were many in the neighbourhood so that after a week or ten days the search was discontinued and the unpleasant fact had to be faced that ernest must have another watch another knife and a small sum of pocket money
it was only right however that ernest should pay half the cost of the watch this should be made easy for him for it should be deducted from his pocket money in halfyearly instalments extending over two or even it might be three years
in ernest's own interests then as well as those of his father and mother it would be well that the watch should cost as little as possible so it was resolved to buy a secondhand one
nothing was to be said to ernest but it was to be bought and laid upon his plate as a surprise just before the holidays were over
theobald would have to go to the county town in a few days and could then find some secondhand watch which would answer sufficiently well
in the course of time therefore theobald went furnished with a long list of household commissions among which was the purchase of a watch for ernest
those as i have said were always happy times when theobald was away for a whole day certain the boy was beginning to feel easy in his mind as though god had heard his prayers and he was not going to be found out
altogether the day had proved an unusually tranquil one but alas
it was not to close as it had begun the fickle atmosphere in which he lived was never more likely to breed a storm than after such an interval of brilliant calm and when theobald returned ernest had only to look in his face to see that a hurricane was approaching
christina saw that something had gone very wrong and was quite frightened lest theobald should have heard of some serious money loss he did not however at once unbosom himself but rang the bell and said to the servant tell master ernest i wish to speak to him in the dining room
chapter xli   long before ernest reached the diningroom his illdivining soul had told him that his sin had found him out
what head of a family ever sends for any of its members into the diningroom if his intentions are honourable
when he reached it he found it emptyhis father having been called away for a few minutes unexpectedly upon some parish businessand he was left in the same kind of suspense as people are in after they have been ushered into their dentist's anteroom
of all the rooms in the house he hated the diningroom worst
it was here that he had had to do his latin and greek lessons with his father
it had a smell of some particular kind of polish or varnish which was used in polishing the furniture and neither i nor ernest can even now come within range of the smell of this kind of varnish without our hearts failing us
over the chimneypiece there was a veritable old master one of the few original pictures which mr george pontifex had brought from italy
it was supposed to be a salvator rosa and had been bought as a great bargain
the subject was elijah or elisha whichever it was being fed by the ravens in the desert
there were the ravens in the upper right hand corner with bread and meat in their beaks and claws and there was the prophet in question in the lower lefthand corner looking longingly up towards them
when ernest was a very small boy it had been a constant matter of regret to him that the food which the ravens carried never actually reached the prophet he did not understand the limitation of the painter's art and wanted the meat and the prophet to be brought into direct contact
one day with the help of some steps which had been left in the room he had clambered up to the picture and with a piece of bread and butter traced a greasy line right across it from the ravens to elisha's mouth after which he had felt more comfortable
ernest's mind was drifting back to this youthful escapade when he heard his father's hand on the door and in another second theobald entered
oh ernest said he in an offhand rather cheery manner there's a little matter which i should like you to explain to me as i have no doubt you very easily can
thump thump thump went ernest's heart against his ribs but his father's manner was so much nicer than usual that he began to think it might be after all only another false alarm
it had occurred to your mother and myself that we should like to set you up with a watch again before you went back to school oh that's all said ernest to himself quite relieved and i have been today to look out for a secondhand one which should answer every purpose so long as you're at school
theobald spoke as if watches had halfadozen purposes besides timekeeping but he could hardly open his mouth without using one or other of his tags and answering every purpose was one of them
ernest was breaking out into the usual expressions of gratitude when theobald continued you are interrupting me and ernest's heart thumped again
you are interrupting me ernest
i have not yet done
ernest was instantly dumb
i passed several shops with secondhand watches for sale but i saw none of a description and price which pleased me till at last i was shown one which had so the shopman said been left with him recently for sale and which i at once recognised as the one which had been given you by your aunt alethea
even if i had failed to recognise it as perhaps i might have done i should have identified it directly it reached my hands inasmuch as it had 'e
p a present from a p' engraved upon the inside
i need say no more to show that this was the very watch which you told your mother and me that you had dropped out of your pocket
up to this time theobald's manner had been studiously calm and his words had been uttered slowly but here he suddenly quickened and flung off the mask as he added the words or some such cock and bull story which your mother and i were too truthful to disbelieve
you can guess what must be our feelings now
ernest felt that this last homethrust was just
in his less anxious moments he had thought his papa and mamma green for the readiness with which they believed him but he could not deny that their credulity was a proof of their habitual truthfulness of mind
in common justice he must own that it was very dreadful for two such truthful people to have a son as untruthful as he knew himself to be
believing that a son of your mother and myself would be incapable of falsehood i at once assumed that some tramp had picked the watch up and was now trying to dispose of it
this to the best of my belief was not accurate
theobald's first assumption had been that it was ernest who was trying to sell the watch and it was an inspiration of the moment to say that his magnanimous mind had at once conceived the idea of a tramp
you may imagine how shocked i was when i discovered that the watch had been brought for sale by that miserable woman ellenhere ernest's heart hardened a little and he felt as near an approach to an instinct to turn as one so defenceless could be expected to feel his father quickly perceived this and continued who was turned out of this house in circumstances which i will not pollute your ears by more particularly describing
i put aside the horrid conviction which was beginning to dawn upon me and assumed that in the interval between her dismissal and her leaving this house she had added theft to her other sin and having found your watch in your bedroom had purloined it
it even occurred to me that you might have missed your watch after the woman was gone and suspecting who had taken it had run after the carriage in order to recover it but when i told the shopman of my suspicions he assured me that the person who left it with him had declared most solemnly that it had been given her by her master's son whose property it was and who had a perfect right to dispose of it
he told me further that thinking the circumstances in which the watch was offered for sale somewhat suspicious he had insisted upon the woman's telling him the whole story of how she came by it before he would consent to buy it of her
he said that at firstas women of that stamp invariably doshe tried prevarication but on being threatened that she should at once be given into custody if she did not tell the whole truth she described the way in which you had run after the carriage till as she said you were black in the face and insisted on giving her all your pocket money your knife and your watch
she added that my coachman johnwhom i shall instantly dischargewas witness to the whole transaction
now ernest be pleased to tell me whether this appalling story is true or false
it never occurred to ernest to ask his father why he did not hit a man his own size or to stop him midway in the story with a remonstrance against being kicked when he was down
the boy was too much shocked and shaken to be inventive he could only drift and stammer out that the tale was true
so i feared said theobald and now ernest be good enough to ring the bell
when the bell had been answered theobald desired that john should be sent for and when john came theobald calculated the wages due to him and desired him at once to leave the house
john's manner was quiet and respectful
he took his dismissal as a matter of course for theobald had hinted enough to make him understand why he was being discharged but when he saw ernest sitting pale and awe struck on the edge of his chair against the diningroom wall a sudden thought seemed to strike him and turning to theobald he said in a broad northern accent which i will not attempt to reproduce  look here master i can guess what all this is aboutnow before i goes i want to have a word with you
ernest said theobald leave the room
no master ernest you shan't said john planting himself against the door
now master he continued you may do as you please about me
i've been a good servant to you and i don't mean to say as you've been a bad master to me but i do say that if you bear hardly on master ernest here i have those in the village as 'll hear on't and let me know and if i do hear on't i'll come back and break every bone in your skin so there
john's breath came and went quickly as though he would have been well enough pleased to begin the bonebreaking business at once
theobald turned of an ashen colournot as he explained afterwards at the idle threats of a detected and angry ruffian but at such atrocious insolence from one of his own servants
i shall leave master ernest john he rejoined proudly to the reproaches of his own conscience
thank god and thank john thought ernest
as for yourself i admit that you have been an excellent servant until this unfortunate business came on and i shall have much pleasure in giving you a character if you want one
have you anything more to say
no more nor what i have said said john sullenly but what i've said i means and i'll stick tocharacter or no character
oh you need not be afraid about your character john said theobald kindly and as it is getting late there can be no occasion for you to leave the house before tomorrow morning
to this there was no reply from john who retired packed up his things and left the house at once
when christina heard what had happened she said she could condone all except that theobald should have been subjected to such insolence from one of his own servants through the misconduct of his son
theobald was the bravest man in the whole world and could easily have collared the wretch and turned him out of the room but how far more dignified how far nobler had been his reply
how it would tell in a novel or upon the stage for though the stage as a whole was immoral yet there were doubtless some plays which were improving spectacles
she could fancy the whole house hushed with excitement at hearing john's menace and hardly breathing by reason of their interest and expectation of the coming answer
then the actorprobably the great and good mr macreadywould say i shall leave master ernest john to the reproaches of his own conscience
oh it was sublime
what a roar of applause must follow
then she should enter herself and fling her arms about her husband's neck and call him her lionhearted husband
when the curtain dropped it would be buzzed about the house that the scene just witnessed had been drawn from real life and had actually occurred in the household of the rev
theobald pontifex who had married a miss allaby etc etc
as regards ernest the suspicions which had already crossed her mind were deepened but she thought it better to leave the matter where it was
at present she was in a very strong position
ernest's official purity was firmly established but at the same time he had shown himself so susceptible that she was able to fuse two contradictory impressions concerning him into a single idea and consider him as a kind of joseph and don juan in one
this was what she had wanted all along but her vanity being gratified by the possession of such a son there was an end of it the son himself was naught
no doubt if john had not interfered ernest would have had to expiate his offence with ache penury and imprisonment
as it was the boy was to consider himself as undergoing these punishments and as suffering pangs of unavailing remorse inflicted on him by his conscience into the bargain but beyond the fact that theobald kept him more closely to his holiday task and the continued coldness of his parents no ostensible punishment was meted out to him
ernest however tells me that he looks back upon this as the time when he began to know that he had a cordial and active dislike for both his parents which i suppose means that he was now beginning to be aware that he was reaching man's estate
chapter xlii   about a week before he went back to school his father again sent for him into the diningroom and told him that he should restore him his watch but that he should deduct the sum he had paid for itfor he had thought it better to pay a few shillings rather than dispute the ownership of the watch seeing that ernest had undoubtedly given it to ellenfrom his pocket money in payments which should extend over two half years
he would therefore have to go back to roughborough this half year with only five shillings' pocket money
if he wanted more he must earn more merit money
ernest was not so careful about money as a pattern boy should be
he did not say to himself now i have got a sovereign which must last me fifteen weeks therefore i may spend exactly one shilling and fourpence in each weekand spend exactly one and fourpence in each week accordingly
he ran through his money at about the same rate as other boys did being pretty well cleaned out a few days after he had got back to school
when he had no more money he got a little into debt and when as far in debt as he could see his way to repaying he went without luxuries
immediately he got any money he would pay his debts if there was any over he would spend it if there was notand there seldom washe would begin to go on tick again
his finance was always based upon the supposition that he should go back to school with  pound in his pocketof which he owed say a matter of fifteen shillings
there would be five shillings for sundry school subscriptionsbut when these were paid the weekly allowance of sixpence given to each boy in hall his merit money which this half he was resolved should come to a good sum and renewed credit would carry him through the half
the sudden failure of  was disastrous to my hero's scheme of finance
his face betrayed his emotions so clearly that theobald said he was determined to learn the truth at once and this time without days and days of falsehood before he reached it
the melancholy fact was not long in coming out namely that the wretched ernest added debt to the vices of idleness falsehood and possiblyfor it was not impossibleimmorality
how had he come to get into debt
did the other boys do so
ernest reluctantly admitted that they did
with what shops did they get into debt
this was asking too much ernest said he didn't know
oh ernest ernest exclaimed his mother who was in the room do not so soon a second time presume upon the forbearance of the tenderesthearted father in the world
give time for one stab to heal before you wound him with another
this was all very fine but what was ernest to do
how could he get the school shopkeepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the boys go on tick with them
there was mrs cross a good old soul who used to sell hot rolls and butter for breakfast or eggs and toast or it might be the quarter of a fowl with bread sauce and mashed potatoes for which she would charge d
if she made a farthing out of the sixpence it was as much as she did
when the boys would come trooping into her shop after the hounds how often had not ernest heard her say to her servant girls now then you wanches git some cheers
all the boys were fond of her and was he ernest to tell tales about her
it was horrible
now look here ernest said his father with his blackest scowl i am going to put a stop to this nonsense once for all
either take me fully into your confidence as a son should take a father and trust me to deal with this matter as a clergyman and a man of the worldor understand distinctly that i shall take the whole story to dr skinner who i imagine will take much sterner measures than i should
oh ernest ernest sobbed christina be wise in time and trust those who have already shown you that they know but too well how to be forbearing
no genuine hero of romance should have hesitated for a moment
nothing should have cajoled or frightened him into telling tales out of school
ernest thought of his ideal boys they he well knew would have let their tongues be cut out of them before information could have been wrung from any word of theirs
but ernest was not an ideal boy and he was not strong enough for his surroundings i doubt how far any boy could withstand the moral pressure which was brought to bear upon him at any rate he could not do so and after a little more writhing he yielded himself a passive prey to the enemy
he consoled himself with the reflection that his papa had not played the confidence trick on him quite as often as his mamma had and that probably it was better he should tell his father than that his father should insist on dr skinner's making an inquiry
his papa's conscience jabbered a good deal but not as much as his mamma's
the little fool forgot that he had not given his father as many chances of betraying him as he had given to christina
then it all came out
he owed this at mrs cross's and this to mrs jones and this at the swan and bottle public house to say nothing of another shilling or sixpence or two in other quarters
nevertheless theobald and christina were not satiated but rather the more they discovered the greater grew their appetite for discovery it was their obvious duty to find out everything for though they might rescue their own darling from this hotbed of iniquity without getting to know more than they knew at present were there not other papas and mammas with darlings whom also they were bound to rescue if it were yet possible
what boys then owed money to these harpies as well as ernest
here again there was a feeble show of resistance but the thumbscrews were instantly applied and ernest demoralised as he already was recanted and submitted himself to the powers that were
he told only a little less than he knew or thought he knew
he was examined reexamined crossexamined sent to the retirement of his own bedroom and crossexamined again the smoking in mrs jones' kitchen all came out which boys smoked and which did not which boys owed money and roughly how much and where which boys swore and used bad language
theobald was resolved that this time ernest should as he called it take him into his confidence without reserve so the school list which went with dr skinner's halfyearly bills was brought out and the most secret character of each boy was gone through seriatim by mr and mrs pontifex so far as it was in ernest's power to give information concerning it and yet theobald had on the preceding sunday preached a less feeble sermon than he commonly preached upon the horrors of the inquisition
no matter how awful was the depravity revealed to them the pair never flinched but probed and probed till they were on the point of reaching subjects more delicate than they had yet touched upon
here ernest's unconscious self took the matter up and made a resistance to which his conscious self was unequal by tumbling him off his chair in a fit of fainting
dr martin was sent for and pronounced the boy to be seriously unwell at the same time he prescribed absolute rest and absence from nervous excitement
so the anxious parents were unwillingly compelled to be content with what they had got alreadybeing frightened into leading him a quiet life for the short remainder of the holidays
they were not idle but satan can find as much mischief for busy hands as for idle ones so he sent a little job in the direction of battersby which theobald and christina undertook immediately
it would be a pity they reasoned that ernest should leave roughborough now that he had been there three years it would be difficult to find another school for him and to explain why he had left roughborough
besides dr skinner and theobald were supposed to be old friends and it would be unpleasant to offend him these were all valid reasons for not removing the boy
the proper thing to do then would be to warn dr skinner confidentially of the state of his school and to furnish him with a school list annotated with the remarks extracted from ernest which should be appended to the name of each boy
theobald was the perfection of neatness while his son was ill upstairs he copied out the school list so that he could throw his comments into a tabular form which assumed the following shapeonly that of course i have changed the names
one cross in each square was to indicate occasional offence two stood for frequent and three for habitual delinquency
smoking     drinking beer    swearing      notes                       at the swan     and obscene                       and bottle
language
smith        o            o              xx          will smoke                                                      next half brown       xxx           o               x jones        x            xx              xxx robinson    xx            xx              x  and thus through the whole school
of course in justice to ernest dr skinner would be bound over to secrecy before a word was said to him but ernest being thus protected he could not be furnished with the facts too completely
chapter xliii   so important did theobald consider this matter that he made a special journey to roughborough before the half year began
it was a relief to have him out of the house but though his destination was not mentioned ernest guessed where he had gone
to this day he considers his conduct at this crisis to have been one of the most serious laches of his lifeone which he can never think of without shame and indignation
he says he ought to have run away from home
but what good could he have done if he had
he would have been caught brought back and examined two days later instead of two days earlier
a boy of barely sixteen cannot stand against the moral pressure of a father and mother who have always oppressed him any more than he can cope physically with a powerful fullgrown man
true he may allow himself to be killed rather than yield but this is being so morbidly heroic as to come close round again to cowardice for it is little else than suicide which is universally condemned as cowardly
on the reassembling of the school it became apparent that something had gone wrong
dr skinner called the boys together and with much pomp excommunicated mrs cross and mrs jones by declaring their shops to be out of bounds
the street in which the swan and bottle stood was also forbidden
the vices of drinking and smoking therefore were clearly aimed at and before prayers dr skinner spoke a few impressive words about the abominable sin of using bad language
ernest's feelings can be imagined
next day at the hour when the daily punishments were read out though there had not yet been time for him to have offended ernest pontifex was declared to have incurred every punishment which the school provided for evildoers
he was placed on the idle list for the whole half year and on perpetual detentions his bounds were curtailed he was to attend junior callingsover in fact he was so hemmed in with punishments upon every side that it was hardly possible for him to go outside the school gates
this unparalleled list of punishments inflicted on the first day of the half year and intended to last till the ensuing christmas holidays was not connected with any specified offence
it required no great penetration therefore on the part of the boys to connect ernest with the putting mrs cross's and mrs jones's shops out of bounds
great indeed was the indignation about mrs cross who it was known remembered dr skinner himself as a small boy only just got into jackets and had doubtless let him have many a sausage and mashed potatoes upon deferred payment
the head boys assembled in conclave to consider what steps should be taken but hardly had they done so before ernest knocked timidly at the headroom door and took the bull by the horns by explaining the facts as far as he could bring himself to do so
he made a clean breast of everything except about the school list and the remarks he had made about each boy's character
this infamy was more than he could own to and he kept his counsel concerning it
fortunately he was safe in doing so for dr skinner pedant and more than pedant though he was had still just sense enough to turn on theobald in the matter of the school list
whether he resented being told that he did not know the characters of his own boys or whether he dreaded a scandal about the school i know not but when theobald had handed him the list over which he had expended so much pains dr skinner had cut him uncommonly short and had then and there with more suavity than was usual with him committed it to the flames before theobald's own eyes
ernest got off with the head boys easier than he expected
it was admitted that the offence heinous though it was had been committed under extenuating circumstances the frankness with which the culprit had confessed all his evidently unfeigned remorse and the fury with which dr skinner was pursuing him tended to bring about a reaction in his favour as though he had been more sinned against than sinning
as the half year wore on his spirits gradually revived and when attacked by one of his fits of selfabasement he was in some degree consoled by having found out that even his father and mother whom he had supposed so immaculate were no better than they should be
about the fifth of november it was a school custom to meet on a certain common not far from roughborough and burn somebody in effigy this being the compromise arrived at in the matter of fireworks and guy fawkes festivities
this year it was decided that pontifex's governor should be the victim and ernest though a good deal exercised in mind as to what he ought to do in the end saw no sufficient reason for holding aloof from proceedings which as he justly remarked could not do his father any harm
it so happened that the bishop had held a confirmation at the school on the fifth of november
dr skinner had not quite liked the selection of this day but the bishop was pressed by many engagements and had been compelled to make the arrangement as it then stood
ernest was among those who had to be confirmed and was deeply impressed with the solemn importance of the ceremony
when he felt the huge old bishop drawing down upon him as he knelt in chapel he could hardly breathe and when the apparition paused before him and laid its hands upon his head he was frightened almost out of his wits
he felt that he had arrived at one of the great turning points of his life and that the ernest of the future could resemble only very faintly the ernest of the past
this happened at about noon but by the one o'clock dinnerhour the effect of the confirmation had worn off and he saw no reason why he should forego his annual amusement with the bonfire so he went with the others and was very valiant till the image was actually produced and was about to be burnt then he felt a little frightened
it was a poor thing enough made of paper calico and straw but they had christened it the rev
theobald pontifex and he had a revulsion of feeling as he saw it being carried towards the bonfire
still he held his ground and in a few minutes when all was over felt none the worse for having assisted at a ceremony which after all was prompted by a boyish love of mischief rather than by rancour
i should say that ernest had written to his father and told him of the unprecedented way in which he was being treated he even ventured to suggest that theobald should interfere for his protection and reminded him how the story had been got out of him but theobald had had enough of dr skinner for the present the burning of the school list had been a rebuff which did not encourage him to meddle a second time in the internal economics of roughborough
he therefore replied that he must either remove ernest from roughborough altogether which would for many reasons be undesirable or trust to the discretion of the head master as regards the treatment he might think best for any of his pupils
ernest said no more he still felt that it was so discreditable to him to have allowed any confession to be wrung from him that he could not press the promised amnesty for himself
it was during the mother cross row as it was long styled among the boys that a remarkable phenomenon was witnessed at roughborough
i mean that of the head boys under certain conditions doing errands for their juniors
the head boys had no bounds and could go to mrs cross's whenever they liked they actually therefore made themselves gobetweens and would get anything from either mrs cross's or mrs jones's for any boy no matter how low in the school between the hours of a quarter to nine and nine in the morning and a quarter to six and six in the afternoon
by degrees however the boys grew bolder and the shops though not openly declared in bounds again were tacitly allowed to be so
chapter xliv   i may spare the reader more details about my hero's school days
he rose always in spite of himself into the doctor's form and for the last two years or so of his time was among the praepostors though he never rose into the upper half of them
he did little and i think the doctor rather gave him up as a boy whom he had better leave to himself for he rarely made him construe and he used to send in his exercises or not pretty much as he liked
his tacit unconscious obstinacy had in time effected more even than a few bold sallies in the first instance would have done
to the end of his career his position inter pares was what it had been at the beginning namely among the upper part of the less reputable classwhether of seniors or juniorsrather than among the lower part of the more respectable
only once in the whole course of his school life did he get praise from dr skinner for any exercise and this he has treasured as the best example of guarded approval which he has ever seen
he had had to write a copy of alcaics on the dogs of the monks of st bernard and when the exercise was returned to him he found the doctor had written on it in this copy of alcaicswhich is still excessively badi fancy that i can discern some faint symptoms of improvement
ernest says that if the exercise was any better than usual it must have been by a fluke for he is sure that he always liked dogs especially st bernard dogs far too much to take any pleasure in writing alcaics about them
as i look back upon it he said to me but the other day with a hearty laugh i respect myself more for having never once got the best mark for an exercise than i should do if i had got it every time it could be got
i am glad nothing could make me do latin and greek verses i am glad skinner could never get any moral influence over me i am glad i was idle at school and i am glad my father overtasked me as a boyotherwise likely enough i should have acquiesced in the swindle and might have written as good a copy of alcaics about the dogs of the monks of st bernard as my neighbours and yet i don't know for i remember there was another boy who sent in a latin copy of some sort but for his own pleasure he wrote the following     the dogs of the monks of st bernard go    to pick little children out of the snow    and around their necks is the cordial gin    tied with a little bit of bobbin
i should like to have written that and i did try but i couldn't
i didn't quite like the last line and tried to mend it but i couldn't
i fancied i could see traces of bitterness against the instructors of his youth in ernest's manner and said something to this effect
oh no he replied still laughing no more than st anthony felt towards the devils who had tempted him when he met some of them casually a hundred or a couple of hundred years afterwards
of course he knew they were devils but that was all right enough there must be devils
st anthony probably liked these devils better than most others and for old acquaintance sake showed them as much indulgence as was compatible with decorum
besides you know he added st anthony tempted the devils quite as much as they tempted him for his peculiar sanctity was a greater temptation to tempt him than they could stand
strictly speaking it was the devils who were the more to be pitied for they were led up by st anthony to be tempted and fell whereas st anthony did not fall
i believe i was a disagreeable and unintelligible boy and if ever i meet skinner there is no one whom i would shake hands with or do a good turn to more readily
at home things went on rather better the ellen and mother cross rows sank slowly down upon the horizon and even at home he had quieter times now that he had become a praepostor
nevertheless the watchful eye and protecting hand were still ever over him to guard his comings in and his goings out and to spy out all his ways
is it wonderful that the boy though always trying to keep up appearances as though he were cheerful and contentedand at times actually being sowore often an anxious jaded look when he thought none were looking which told of an almost incessant conflict within
doubtless theobald saw these looks and knew how to interpret them but it was his profession to know how to shut his eyes to things that were inconvenientno clergyman could keep his benefice for a month if he could not do this besides he had allowed himself for so many years to say things he ought not to have said and not to say the things he ought to have said that he was little likely to see anything that he thought it more convenient not to see unless he was made to do so
it was not much that was wanted
to make no mysteries where nature has made none to bring his conscience under something like reasonable control to give ernest his head a little more to ask fewer questions and to give him pocket money with a desire that it should be spent upon menus plaisirs 
   call that not much indeed laughed ernest as i read him what i have just written
why it is the whole duty of a father but it is the mysterymaking which is the worst evil
if people would dare to speak to one another unreservedly there would be a good deal less sorrow in the world a hundred years hence
to return however to roughborough
on the day of his leaving when he was sent for into the library to be shaken hands with he was surprised to feel that though assuredly glad to leave he did not do so with any especial grudge against the doctor rankling in his breast
he had come to the end of it all and was still alive nor take it all round more seriously amiss than other people
dr skinner received him graciously and was even frolicsome after his own heavy fashion
young people are almost always placable and ernest felt as he went away that another such interview would not only have wiped off all old scores but have brought him round into the ranks of the doctor's admirers and supportersamong whom it is only fair to say that the greater number of the more promising boys were found
just before saying goodbye the doctor actually took down a volume from those shelves which had seemed so awful six years previously and gave it to him after having written his name in it and the words greek text which i believe means with all kind wishes from the donor
the book was one written in latin by a germanschomann de comitiis atheniensibusnot exactly light and cheerful reading but ernest felt it was high time he got to understand the athenian constitution and manner of voting he had got them up a great many times already but had forgotten them as fast as he had learned them now however that the doctor had given him this book he would master the subject once for all
how strange it was
he wanted to remember these things very badly he knew he did but he could never retain them in spite of himself they no sooner fell upon his mind than they fell off it again he had such a dreadful memory whereas if anyone played him a piece of music and told him where it came from he never forgot that though he made no effort to retain it and was not even conscious of trying to remember it at all
his mind must be badly formed and he was no good
having still a short time to spare he got the keys of st michael's church and went to have a farewell practice upon the organ which he could now play fairly well
he walked up and down the aisle for a while in a meditative mood and then settling down to the organ played they loathed to drink of the river about six times over after which he felt more composed and happier then tearing himself away from the instrument he loved so well he hurried to the station
as the train drew out he looked down from a high embankment on to the little house his aunt had taken and where it might be said she had died through her desire to do him a kindness
there were the two wellknown bow windows out of which he had often stepped to run across the lawn into the workshop
he reproached himself with the little gratitude he had shown towards this kind ladythe only one of his relations whom he had ever felt as though he could have taken into his confidence
dearly as he loved her memory he was glad she had not known the scrapes he had got into since she died perhaps she might not have forgiven themand how awful that would have been
but then if she had lived perhaps many of his ills would have been spared him
as he mused thus he grew sad again
where where he asked himself was it all to end
was it to be always sin shame and sorrow in the future as it had been in the past and the everwatchful eye and protecting hand of his father laying burdens on him greater than he could bearor was he too some day or another to come to feel that he was fairly well and happy
there was a gray mist across the sun so that the eye could bear its light and ernest while musing as above was looking right into the middle of the sun himself as into the face of one whom he knew and was fond of
at first his face was grave but kindly as of a tired man who feels that a long task is over but in a few seconds the more humorous side of his misfortunes presented itself to him and he smiled half reproachfully half merrily as thinking how little all that had happened to him really mattered and how small were his hardships as compared with those of most people
still looking into the eye of the sun and smiling dreamily he thought how he had helped to burn his father in effigy and his look grew merrier till at last he broke out into a laugh
exactly at this moment the light veil of cloud parted from the sun and he was brought to terra firma by the breaking forth of the sunshine
on this he became aware that he was being watched attentively by a fellowtraveller opposite to him an elderly gentleman with a large head and irongrey hair
my young friend said he goodnaturedly you really must not carry on conversations with people in the sun while you are in a public railway carriage
the old gentleman said not another word but unfolded his times and began to read it
as for ernest he blushed crimson
the pair did not speak during the rest of the time they were in the carriage but they eyed each other from time to time so that the face of each was impressed on the recollection of the other
chapter xlv   some people say that their school days were the happiest of their lives
they may be right but i always look with suspicion upon those whom i hear saying this
it is hard enough to know whether one is happy or unhappy now and still harder to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of different times of one's life the utmost that can be said is that we are fairly happy so long as we are not distinctly aware of being miserable
as i was talking with ernest one day not so long since about this he said he was so happy now that he was sure he had never been happier and did not wish to be so but that cambridge was the first place where he had ever been consciously and continuously happy
how can any boy fail to feel an ecstasy of pleasure on first finding himself in rooms which he knows for the next few years are to be his castle
here he will not be compelled to turn out of the most comfortable place as soon as he has ensconced himself in it because papa or mamma happens to come into the room and he should give it up to them
the most cosy chair here is for himself there is no one even to share the room with him or to interfere with his doing as he likes in itsmoking included
why if such a room looked out both back and front on to a blank dead wall it would still be a paradise how much more then when the view is of some quiet grassy court or cloister or garden as from the windows of the greater number of rooms at oxford and cambridge
theobald as an old fellow and tutor of emmanuelat which college he had entered ernestwas able to obtain from the present tutor a certain preference in the choice of rooms ernest's therefore were very pleasant ones looking out upon the grassy court that is bounded by the fellows' gardens
theobald accompanied him to cambridge and was at his best while doing so
he liked the jaunt and even he was not without a certain feeling of pride in having a fullblown son at the university
some of the reflected rays of this splendour were allowed to fall upon ernest himself
theobald said he was willing to hopethis was one of his tagsthat his son would turn over a new leaf now that he had left school and for his own part he was only too readythis was another tagto let bygones be bygones
ernest not yet having his name on the books was able to dine with his father at the fellows' table of one of the other colleges on the invitation of an old friend of theobald's he there made acquaintance with sundry of the good things of this life the very names of which were new to him and felt as he ate them that he was now indeed receiving a liberal education
when at length the time came for him to go to emmanuel where he was to sleep in his new rooms his father came with him to the gates and saw him safe into college a few minutes more and he found himself alone in a room for which he had a latchkey
from this time he dated many days which if not quite unclouded were upon the whole very happy ones
i need not however describe them as the life of a quiet steadygoing undergraduate has been told in a score of novels better than i can tell it
some of ernest's schoolfellows came up to cambridge at the same time as himself and with these he continued on friendly terms during the whole of his college career
other schoolfellows were only a year or two his seniors these called on him and he thus made a sufficiently favourable entree into college life
a straightforwardness of character that was stamped upon his face a love of humour and a temper which was more easily appeased than ruffled made up for some awkwardness and want of savoir faire
he soon became a not unpopular member of the best set of his year and though neither capable of becoming nor aspiring to become a leader was admitted by the leaders as among their nearer hangerson
of ambition he had at that time not one particle greatness or indeed superiority of any kind seemed so far off and incomprehensible to him that the idea of connecting it with himself never crossed his mind
if he could escape the notice of all those with whom he did not feel himself en rapport he conceived that he had triumphed sufficiently
he did not care about taking a good degree except that it must be good enough to keep his father and mother quiet
he did not dream of being able to get a fellowship if he had he would have tried hard to do so for he became so fond of cambridge that he could not bear the thought of having to leave it the briefness indeed of the season during which his present happiness was to last was almost the only thing that now seriously troubled him
having less to attend to in the matter of growing and having got his head more free he took to reading fairly wellnot because he liked it but because he was told he ought to do so and his natural instinct like that of all very young men who are good for anything was to do as those in authority told him
the intention at battersby was for dr skinner had said that ernest could never get a fellowship that he should take a sufficiently good degree to be able to get a tutorship or mastership in some school preparatory to taking orders
when he was twentyone years old his money was to come into his own hands and the best thing he could do with it would be to buy the next presentation to a living the rector of which was now old and live on his mastership or tutorship till the living fell in
he could buy a very good living for the sum which his grandfather's legacy now amounted to for theobald had never had any serious intention of making deductions for his son's maintenance and education and the money had accumulated till it was now about five thousand pounds he had only talked about making deductions in order to stimulate the boy to exertion as far as possible by making him think that this was his only chance of escaping starvationor perhaps from pure love of teasing
when ernest had a living of  or  pounds a year with a house and not too many parishionerswhy he might add to his income by taking pupils or even keeping a school and then say at thirty he might marry
it was not easy for theobald to hit on any much more sensible plan
he could not get ernest into business for he had no business connectionsbesides he did not know what business meant he had no interest again at the bar medicine was a profession which subjected its students to ordeals and temptations which these fond parents shrank from on behalf of their boy he would be thrown among companions and familiarised with details which might sully him and though he might stand it was only too possible that he would fall
besides ordination was the road which theobald knew and understood and indeed the only road about which he knew anything at all so not unnaturally it was the one he chose for ernest
the foregoing had been instilled into my hero from earliest boyhood much as it had been instilled into theobald himself and with the same resultthe conviction namely that he was certainly to be a clergyman but that it was a long way off yet and he supposed it was all right
as for the duty of reading hard and taking as good a degree as he could this was plain enough so he set himself to work as i have said steadily and to the surprise of everyone as well as himself got a college scholarship of no great value but still a scholarship in his freshman's term
it is hardly necessary to say that theobald stuck to the whole of this money believing the pocketmoney he allowed ernest to be sufficient for him and knowing how dangerous it was for young men to have money at command
i do not suppose it even occurred to him to try and remember what he had felt when his father took a like course in regard to himself
ernest's position in this respect was much what it had been at school except that things were on a larger scale
his tutor's and cook's bills were paid for him his father sent him his wine over and above this he had  pounds a year with which to keep himself in clothes and all other expenses this was about the usual thing at emmanuel in ernest's day though many had much less than this
ernest did as he had done at schoolhe spent what he could soon after he received his money he then incurred a few modest liabilities and then lived penuriously till next term when he would immediately pay his debts and start new ones to much the same extent as those which he had just got rid of
when he came into his  pounds and became independent of his father  or  pounds served to cover the whole of his unauthorised expenditure
he joined the boat club and was constant in his attendance at the boats
he still smoked but never took more wine or beer than was good for him except perhaps on the occasion of a boating supper but even then he found the consequences unpleasant and soon learned how to keep within safe limits
he attended chapel as often as he was compelled to do so he communicated two or three times a year because his tutor told him he ought to in fact he set himself to live soberly and cleanly as i imagine all his instincts prompted him to do and when he fellas who that is born of woman can help sometimes doingit was not till after a sharp tussle with a temptation that was more than his flesh and blood could stand then he was very penitent and would go a fairly long while without sinning again and this was how it had always been with him since he had arrived at years of indiscretion
even to the end of his career at cambridge he was not aware that he had it in him to do anything but others had begun to see that he was not wanting in ability and sometimes told him so
he did not believe it indeed he knew very well that if they thought him clever they were being taken in but it pleased him to have been able to take them in and he tried to do so still further he was therefore a good deal on the look out for cants that he could catch and apply in season and might have done himself some mischief thus if he had not been ready to throw over any cant as soon as he had come across another more nearly to his fancy his friends used to say that when he rose he flew like a snipe darting several times in various directions before he settled down to a steady straight flight but when he had once got into this he would keep to it
chapter xlvi   when he was in his third year a magazine was founded at cambridge the contributions to which were exclusively by undergraduates
ernest sent in an essay upon the greek drama which he has declined to let me reproduce here without his being allowed to reedit it
i have therefore been unable to give it in its original form but when pruned of its redundancies and this is all that has been done to it it runs as follows     i shall not attempt within the limits at my disposal to make a    resume of the rise and progress of the greek drama but will confine    myself to considering whether the reputation enjoyed by the three    chief greek tragedians aeschylus sophocles and euripides is one    that will be permanent or whether they will one day be held to have    been overrated
why i ask myself do i see much that i can easily admire in homer    thucydides herodotus demosthenes aristophanes theocritus parts of    lucretius horace's satires and epistles to say nothing of other    ancient writers and yet find myself at once repelled by even those    works of aeschylus sophocles and euripides which are most generally    admired
with the firstnamed writers i am in the hands of men who feel if    not as i do still as i can understand their feeling and as i am    interested to see that they should have felt with the second i have    so little sympathy that i cannot understand how anyone can ever have    taken any interest in them whatever
their highest flights to me are    dull pompous and artificial productions which if they were to    appear now for the first time would i should think either fall dead    or be severely handled by the critics
i wish to know whether it is i    who am in fault in this matter or whether part of the blame may not    rest with the tragedians themselves
how far i wonder did the athenians genuinely like these poets and    how far was the applause which was lavished upon them due to fashion    or affectation
how far in fact did admiration for the orthodox    tragedians take that place among the athenians which going to church    does among ourselves
this is a venturesome question considering the verdict now generally    given for over two thousand years nor should i have permitted myself    to ask it if it had not been suggested to me by one whose reputation    stands as high and has been sanctioned for as long time as those of    the tragedians themselves i mean by aristophanes
numbers weight of authority and time have conspired to place    aristophanes on as high a literary pinnacle as any ancient writer    with the exception perhaps of homer but he makes no secret of    heartily hating euripides and sophocles and i strongly suspect only    praises aeschylus that he may run down the other two with greater    impunity
for after all there is no such difference between aeschylus    and his successors as will render the former very good and the latter    very bad and the thrusts at aeschylus which aristophanes puts into    the mouth of euripides go home too well to have been written by an    admirer
it may be observed that while euripides accuses aeschylus of being    'pompbundleworded' which i suppose means bombastic and given to    rodomontade aeschylus retorts on euripides that he is a 'gossip    gleaner a describer of beggars and a ragstitcher' from which it    may be inferred that he was truer to the life of his own times than    aeschylus was
it happens however that a faithful rendering of    contemporary life is the very quality which gives its most permanent    interest to any work of fiction whether in literature or painting    and it is a not unnatural consequence that while only seven plays by    aeschylus and the same number by sophocles have come down to us we    have no fewer than nineteen by euripides
this however is a digression the question before us is whether    aristophanes really liked aeschylus or only pretended to do so
it    must be remembered that the claims of aeschylus sophocles and    euripides to the foremost place amongst tragedians were held to be as    incontrovertible as those of dante petrarch tasso and ariosto to be    the greatest of italian poets are held among the italians of today
if we can fancy some witty genial writer we will say in florence    finding himself bored by all the poets i have named we can yet    believe he would be unwilling to admit that he disliked them without    exception
he would prefer to think he could see something at any    rate in dante whom he could idealise more easily inasmuch as he was    more remote in order to carry his countrymen the farther with him he    would endeavour to meet them more than was consistent with his own    instincts
without some such palliation as admiration for one at any    rate of the tragedians it would be almost as dangerous for    aristophanes to attack them as it would be for an englishman now to    say that he did not think very much of the elizabethan dramatists
yet    which of us in his heart likes any of the elizabethan dramatists    except shakespeare
are they in reality anything else than literary    struldbrugs
i conclude upon the whole that aristophanes did not like any of the    tragedians yet no one will deny that this keen witty outspoken    writer was as good a judge of literary value and as able to see any    beauties that the tragic dramas contained as ninetenths at any rate    of ourselves
he had moreover the advantage of thoroughly    understanding the standpoint from which the tragedians expected their    work to be judged and what was his conclusion
briefly it was little    else than this that they were a fraud or something very like it
for    my own part i cordially agree with him
i am free to confess that    with the exception perhaps of some of the psalms of david i know no    writings which seem so little to deserve their reputation
i do not    know that i should particularly mind my sisters reading them but i    will take good care never to read them myself
this last bit about the psalms was awful and there was a great fight with the editor as to whether or no it should be allowed to stand
ernest himself was frightened at it but he had once heard someone say that the psalms were many of them very poor and on looking at them more closely after he had been told this he found that there could hardly be two opinions on the subject
so he caught up the remark and reproduced it as his own concluding that these psalms had probably never been written by david at all but had got in among the others by mistake
the essay perhaps on account of the passage about the psalms created quite a sensation and on the whole was well received
ernest's friends praised it more highly than it deserved and he was himself very proud of it but he dared not show it at battersby
he knew also that he was now at the end of his tether this was his one idea i feel sure he had caught more than half of it from other people and now he had not another thing left to write about
he found himself cursed with a small reputation which seemed to him much bigger than it was and a consciousness that he could never keep it up
before many days were over he felt his unfortunate essay to be a white elephant to him which he must feed by hurrying into all sorts of frantic attempts to cap his triumph and as may be imagined these attempts were failures
he did not understand that if he waited and listened and observed another idea of some kind would probably occur to him some day and that the development of this would in its turn suggest still further ones
he did not yet know that the very worst way of getting hold of ideas is to go hunting expressly after them
the way to get them is to study something of which one is fond and to note down whatever crosses one's mind in reference to it either during study or relaxation in a little notebook kept always in the waistcoat pocket
ernest has come to know all about this now but it took him a long time to find it out for this is not the kind of thing that is taught at schools and universities
nor yet did he know that ideas no less than the living beings in whose minds they arise must be begotten by parents not very unlike themselves the most original still differing but slightly from the parents that have given rise to them
life is like a fugue everything must grow out of the subject and there must be nothing new
nor again did he see how hard it is to say where one idea ends and another begins nor yet how closely this is paralleled in the difficulty of saying where a life begins or ends or an action or indeed anything there being an unity in spite of infinite multitude and an infinite multitude in spite of unity
he thought that ideas came into clever people's heads by a kind of spontaneous germination without parentage in the thoughts of others or the course of observation for as yet he believed in genius of which he well knew that he had none if it was the fine frenzied thing he thought it was
not very long before this he had come of age and theobald had handed him over his money which amounted now to  pounds it was invested to bring in  per cent and gave him therefore an income of  pounds a year
he did not however realise the fact he could realise nothing so foreign to his experience that he was independent of his father till a long time afterwards nor did theobald make any difference in his manner towards him
so strong was the hold which habit and association held over both father and son that the one considered he had as good a right as ever to dictate and the other that he had as little right as ever to gainsay
during his last year at cambridge he overworked himself through this very blind deference to his father's wishes for there was no reason why he should take more than a poll degree except that his father laid such stress upon his taking honours
he became so ill indeed that it was doubtful how far he would be able to go in for his degree at all but he managed to do so and when the list came out was found to be placed higher than either he or anyone else expected being among the first three or four senior optimes and a few weeks later in the lower half of the second class of the classical tripos
ill as he was when he got home theobald made him go over all the examination papers with him and in fact reproduce as nearly as possible the replies that he had sent in
so little kick had he in him and so deep was the groove into which he had got that while at home he spent several hours a day in continuing his classical and mathematical studies as though he had not yet taken his degree
chapter xlvii   ernest returned to cambridge for the may term of  on the plea of reading for ordination with which he was now face to face and much nearer than he liked
up to this time though not religiously inclined he had never doubted the truth of anything that had been told him about christianity
he had never seen anyone who doubted nor read anything that raised a suspicion in his mind as to the historical character of the miracles recorded in the old and new testaments
it must be remembered that the year  was the last of a term during which the peace of the church of england was singularly unbroken
between  when vestiges of creation appeared and  when essays and reviews marked the commencement of that storm which raged until many years afterwards there was not a single book published in england that caused serious commotion within the bosom of the church
perhaps buckle's history of civilisation and mill's liberty were the most alarming but they neither of them reached the substratum of the reading public and ernest and his friends were ignorant of their very existence
the evangelical movement with the exception to which i shall revert presently had become almost a matter of ancient history
tractarianism had subsided into a tenth day's wonder it was at work but it was not noisy
the vestiges were forgotten before ernest went up to cambridge the catholic aggression scare had lost its terrors ritualism was still unknown by the general provincial public and the gorham and hampden controversies were defunct some years since dissent was not spreading the crimean war was the one engrossing subject to be followed by the indian mutiny and the francoaustrian war
these great events turned men's minds from speculative subjects and there was no enemy to the faith which could arouse even a languid interest
at no time probably since the beginning of the century could an ordinary observer have detected less sign of coming disturbance than at that of which i am writing
i need hardly say that the calm was only on the surface
older men who knew more than undergraduates were likely to do must have seen that the wave of scepticism which had already broken over germany was setting towards our own shores nor was it long indeed before it reached them
ernest had hardly been ordained before three works in quick succession arrested the attention even of those who paid least heed to theological controversy
i mean essays and reviews charles darwin's origin of species and bishop colenso's criticisms on the pentateuch
this however is a digression i must revert to the one phase of spiritual activity which had any life in it during the time ernest was at cambridge that is to say to the remains of the evangelical awakening of more than a generation earlier which was connected with the name of simeon
there were still a good many simeonites or as they were more briefly called sims in ernest's time
every college contained some of them but their headquarters were at caius whither they were attracted by mr clayton who was at that time senior tutor and among the sizars of st john's
behind the then chapel of this lastnamed college there was a labyrinth this was the name it bore of dingy tumbledown rooms tenanted exclusively by the poorest undergraduates who were dependent upon sizarships and scholarships for the means of taking their degrees
to many even at st john's the existence and whereabouts of the labyrinth in which the sizars chiefly lived was unknown some men in ernest's time who had rooms in the first court had never found their way through the sinuous passage which led to it
in the labyrinth there dwelt men of all ages from mere lads to greyhaired old men who had entered late in life
they were rarely seen except in hall or chapel or at lecture where their manners of feeding praying and studying were considered alike objectionable no one knew whence they came whither they went nor what they did for they never showed at cricket or the boats they were a gloomy seedylooking conferie who had as little to glory in in clothes and manners as in the flesh itself
ernest and his friends used to consider themselves marvels of economy for getting on with so little money but the greater number of dwellers in the labyrinth would have considered onehalf of their expenditure to be an exceeding measure of affluence and so doubtless any domestic tyranny which had been experienced by ernest was a small thing to what the average johnian sizar had had to put up with
a few would at once emerge on its being found after their first examination that they were likely to be ornaments to the college these would win valuable scholarships that enabled them to live in some degree of comfort and would amalgamate with the more studious of those who were in a better social position but even these with few exceptions were long in shaking off the uncouthness they brought with them to the university nor would their origin cease to be easily recognisable till they had become dons and tutors
i have seen some of these men attain high position in the world of politics or science and yet still retain a look of labyrinth and johnian sizarship
unprepossessing then in feature gait and manners unkempt and illdressed beyond what can be easily described these poor fellows formed a class apart whose thoughts and ways were not as the thoughts and ways of ernest and his friends and it was among them that simeonism chiefly flourished
destined most of them for the church for in those days holy orders were seldom heard of the simeonites held themselves to have received a very loud call to the ministry and were ready to pinch themselves for years so as to prepare for it by the necessary theological courses
to most of them the fact of becoming clergymen would be the entree into a social position from which they were at present kept out by barriers they well knew to be impassable ordination therefore opened fields for ambition which made it the central point in their thoughts rather than as with ernest something which he supposed would have to be done some day but about which as about dying he hoped there was no need to trouble himself as yet
by way of preparing themselves more completely they would have meetings in one another's rooms for tea and prayer and other spiritual exercises
placing themselves under the guidance of a few wellknown tutors they would teach in sunday schools and be instant in season and out of season in imparting spiritual instruction to all whom they could persuade to listen to them
but the soil of the more prosperous undergraduates was not suitable for the seed they tried to sow
the small pieties with which they larded their discourse if chance threw them into the company of one whom they considered worldly caused nothing but aversion in the minds of those for whom they were intended
when they distributed tracts dropping them by night into good men's letter boxes while they were asleep their tracts got burnt or met with even worse contumely they were themselves also treated with the ridicule which they reflected proudly had been the lot of true followers of christ in all ages
often at their prayer meetings was the passage of st paul referred to in which he bids his corinthian converts note concerning themselves that they were for the most part neither wellbred nor intellectual people
they reflected with pride that they too had nothing to be proud of in these respects and like st paul gloried in the fact that in the flesh they had not much to glory
ernest had several johnian friends and came thus to hear about the simeonites and to see some of them who were pointed out to him as they passed through the courts
they had a repellent attraction for him he disliked them but he could not bring himself to leave them alone
on one occasion he had gone so far as to parody one of the tracts they had sent round in the night and to get a copy dropped into each of the leading simeonites' boxes
the subject he had taken was personal cleanliness
cleanliness he said was next to godliness he wished to know on which side it was to stand and concluded by exhorting simeonites to a freer use of the tub
i cannot commend my hero's humour in this matter his tract was not brilliant but i mention the fact as showing that at this time he was something of a saul and took pleasure in persecuting the elect not as i have said that he had any hankering after scepticism but because like the farmers in his father's village though he would not stand seeing the christian religion made light of he was not going to see it taken seriously
ernest's friends thought his dislike for simeonites was due to his being the son of a clergyman who it was known bullied him it is more likely however that it rose from an unconscious sympathy with them which as in st paul's case in the end drew him into the ranks of those whom he had most despised and hated
chapter xlviii   once recently when he was down at home after taking his degree his mother had had a short conversation with him about his becoming a clergyman set on thereto by theobald who shrank from the subject himself
this time it was during a turn taken in the garden and not on the sofawhich was reserved for supreme occasions
you know my dearest boy she said to him that papa she always called theobald papa when talking to ernest is so anxious you should not go into the church blindly and without fully realising the difficulties of a clergyman's position
he has considered all of them himself and has been shown how small they are when they are faced boldly but he wishes you too to feel them as strongly and completely as possible before committing yourself to irrevocable vows so that you may never never have to regret the step you will have taken
this was the first time ernest had heard that there were any difficulties and he not unnaturally enquired in a vague way after their nature
that my dear boy rejoined christina is a question which i am not fitted to enter upon either by nature or education
i might easily unsettle your mind without being able to settle it again
oh no
such questions are far better avoided by women and i should have thought by men but papa wished me to speak to you upon the subject so that there might be no mistake hereafter and i have done so
now therefore you know all
the conversation ended here so far as this subject was concerned and ernest thought he did know all
his mother would not have told him he knew allnot about a matter of that sortunless he actually did know it well it did not come to very much he supposed there were some difficulties but his father who at any rate was an excellent scholar and a learned man was probably quite right here and he need not trouble himself more about them
so little impression did the conversation make on him that it was not till long afterwards that happening to remember it he saw what a piece of sleight of hand had been practised upon him
theobald and christina however were satisfied that they had done their duty by opening their son's eyes to the difficulties of assenting to all a clergyman must assent to
this was enough it was a matter for rejoicing that though they had been put so fully and candidly before him he did not find them serious
it was not in vain that they had prayed for so many years to be made truly honest and conscientious
and now my dear resumed christina after having disposed of all the difficulties that might stand in the way of ernest's becoming a clergyman there is another matter on which i should like to have a talk with you
it is about your sister charlotte
you know how clever she is and what a dear kind sister she has been and always will be to yourself and joey
i wish my dearest ernest that i saw more chance of her finding a suitable husband than i do at battersby and i sometimes think you might do more than you do to help her
ernest began to chafe at this for he had heard it so often but he said nothing
you know my dear a brother can do so much for his sister if he lays himself out to do it
a mother can do very littleindeed it is hardly a mother's place to seek out young men it is a brother's place to find a suitable partner for his sister all that i can do is to try to make battersby as attractive as possible to any of your friends whom you may invite
and in that she added with a little toss of her head i do not think i have been deficient hitherto
ernest said he had already at different times asked several of his friends
yes my dear but you must admit that they were none of them exactly the kind of young man whom charlotte could be expected to take a fancy to
indeed i must own to having been a little disappointed that you should have yourself chosen any of these as your intimate friends
ernest winced again
you never brought down figgins when you were at roughborough now i should have thought figgins would have been just the kind of boy whom you might have asked to come and see us
figgins had been gone through times out of number already
ernest had hardly known him and figgins being nearly three years older than ernest had left long before he did
besides he had not been a nice boy and had made himself unpleasant to ernest in many ways
now continued his mother there's towneley
i have heard you speak of towneley as having rowed with you in a boat at cambridge
i wish my dear you would cultivate your acquaintance with towneley and ask him to pay us a visit
the name has an aristocratic sound and i think i have heard you say he is an eldest son
ernest flushed at the sound of towneley's name
what had really happened in respect of ernest's friends was briefly this
his mother liked to get hold of the names of the boys and especially of any who were at all intimate with her son the more she heard the more she wanted to know there was no gorging her to satiety she was like a ravenous young cuckoo being fed upon a grass plot by a water wagtail she would swallow all that ernest could bring her and yet be as hungry as before
and she always went to ernest for her meals rather than to joey for joey was either more stupid or more impenetrableat any rate she could pump ernest much the better of the two
from time to time an actual live boy had been thrown to her either by being caught and brought to battersby or by being asked to meet her if at any time she came to roughborough
she had generally made herself agreeable or fairly agreeable as long as the boy was present but as soon as she got ernest to herself again she changed her note
into whatever form she might throw her criticisms it came always in the end to this that his friend was no good that ernest was not much better and that he should have brought her someone else for this one would not do at all
the more intimate the boy had been or was supposed to be with ernest the more he was declared to be naught till in the end he had hit upon the plan of saying concerning any boy whom he particularly liked that he was not one of his especial chums and that indeed he hardly knew why he had asked him but he found he only fell on scylla in trying to avoid charybdis for though the boy was declared to be more successful it was ernest who was naught for not thinking more highly of him
when she had once got hold of a name she never forgot it
and how is so andso
she would exclaim mentioning some former friend of ernest's with whom he had either now quarrelled or who had long since proved to be a mere comet and no fixed star at all
how ernest wished he had never mentioned soandso's name and vowed to himself that he would never talk about his friends in future but in a few hours he would forget and would prattle away as imprudently as ever then his mother would pounce noiselessly on his remarks as a barnowl pounces upon a mouse and would bring them up in a pellet six months afterwards when they were no longer in harmony with their surroundings
then there was theobald
if a boy or college friend had been invited to battersby theobald would lay himself out at first to be agreeable
he could do this well enough when he liked and as regards the outside world he generally did like
his clerical neighbours and indeed all his neighbours respected him yearly more and more and would have given ernest sufficient cause to regret his imprudence if he had dared to hint that he had anything however little to complain of
theobald's mind worked in this way now i know ernest has told this boy what a disagreeable person i am and i will just show him that i am not disagreeable at all but a good old fellow a jolly old boy in fact a regular old brick and that it is ernest who is in fault all through
so he would behave very nicely to the boy at first and the boy would be delighted with him and side with him against ernest
of course if ernest had got the boy to come to battersby he wanted him to enjoy his visit and was therefore pleased that theobald should behave so well but at the same time he stood so much in need of moral support that it was painful to him to see one of his own familiar friends go over to the enemy's camp
for no matter how well we may know a thinghow clearly we may see a certain patch of colour for example as red it shakes us and knocks us about to find another see it or be more than half inclined to see it as green
theobald had generally begun to get a little impatient before the end of the visit but the impression formed during the earlier part was the one which the visitor had carried away with him
theobald never discussed any of the boys with ernest
it was christina who did this
theobald let them come because christina in a quiet persistent way insisted on it when they did come he behaved as i have said civilly but he did not like it whereas christina did like it very much she would have had half roughborough and half cambridge to come and stay at battersby if she could have managed it and if it would not have cost so much money she liked their coming so that she might make a new acquaintance and she liked tearing them to pieces and flinging the bits over ernest as soon as she had had enough of them
the worst of it was that she had so often proved to be right
boys and young men are violent in their affections but they are seldom very constant it is not till they get older that they really know the kind of friend they want in their earlier essays young men are simply learning to judge character
ernest had been no exception to the general rule
his swans had one after the other proved to be more or less geese even in his own estimation and he was beginning almost to think that his mother was a better judge of character than he was but i think it may be assumed with some certainty that if ernest had brought her a real young swan she would have declared it to be the ugliest and worst goose of all that she had yet seen
at first he had not suspected that his friends were wanted with a view to charlotte it was understood that charlotte and they might perhaps take a fancy for one another and that would be so very nice would it not
but he did not see that there was any deliberate malice in the arrangement
now however that he had awoke to what it all meant he was less inclined to bring any friend of his to battersby
it seemed to his silly young mind almost dishonest to ask your friend to come and see you when all you really meant was please marry my sister
it was like trying to obtain money under false pretences
if he had been fond of charlotte it might have been another matter but he thought her one of the most disagreeable young women in the whole circle of his acquaintance
she was supposed to be very clever
all young ladies are either very pretty or very clever or very sweet they may take their choice as to which category they will go in for but go in for one of the three they must
it was hopeless to try and pass charlotte off as either pretty or sweet
so she became clever as the only remaining alternative
ernest never knew what particular branch of study it was in which she showed her talent for she could neither play nor sing nor draw but so astute are women that his mother and charlotte really did persuade him into thinking that she charlotte had something more akin to true genius than any other member of the family
not one however of all the friends whom ernest had been inveigled into trying to inveigle had shown the least sign of being so far struck with charlotte's commanding powers as to wish to make them his own and this may have had something to do with the rapidity and completeness with which christina had dismissed them one after another and had wanted a new one
and now she wanted towneley
ernest had seen this coming and had tried to avoid it for he knew how impossible it was for him to ask towneley even if he had wished to do so
towneley belonged to one of the most exclusive sets in cambridge and was perhaps the most popular man among the whole number of undergraduates
he was big and very handsomeas it seemed to ernest the handsomest man whom he ever had seen or ever could see for it was impossible to imagine a more lively and agreeable countenance
he was good at cricket and boating very goodnatured singularly free from conceit not clever but very sensible and lastly his father and mother had been drowned by the overturning of a boat when he was only two years old and had left him as their only child and heir to one of the finest estates in the south of england
fortune every now and then does things handsomely by a man all round towneley was one of those to whom she had taken a fancy and the universal verdict in this case was that she had chosen wisely
ernest had seen towneley as every one else in the university except of course dons had seen him for he was a man of mark and being very susceptible he had liked towneley even more than most people did but at the same time it never so much as entered his head that he should come to know him
he liked looking at him if he got a chance and was very much ashamed of himself for doing so but there the matter ended
by a strange accident however during ernest's last year when the names of the crews for the scratch fours were drawn he had found himself coxswain of a crew among whom was none other than his especial hero towneley the three others were ordinary mortals but they could row fairly well and the crew on the whole was rather a good one
ernest was frightened out of his wits
when however the two met he found towneley no less remarkable for his entire want of anything like side and for his power of setting those whom he came across at their ease than he was for outward accomplishments the only difference he found between towneley and other people was that he was so very much easier to get on with
of course ernest worshipped him more and more
the scratch fours being ended the connection between the two came to an end but towneley never passed ernest thenceforward without a nod and a few goodnatured words
in an evil moment he had mentioned towneley's name at battersby and now what was the result
here was his mother plaguing him to ask towneley to come down to battersby and marry charlotte
why if he had thought there was the remotest chance of towneley's marrying charlotte he would have gone down on his knees to him and told him what an odious young woman she was and implored him to save himself while there was yet time
but ernest had not prayed to be made truly honest and conscientious for as many years as christina had
he tried to conceal what he felt and thought as well as he could and led the conversation back to the difficulties which a clergyman might feel to stand in the way of his being ordainednot because he had any misgivings but as a diversion
his mother however thought she had settled all that and he got no more out of her
soon afterwards he found the means of escaping and was not slow to avail himself of them
chapter xlix   on his return to cambridge in the may term of  ernest and a few other friends who were also intended for orders came to the conclusion that they must now take a more serious view of their position
they therefore attended chapel more regularly than hitherto and held evening meetings of a somewhat furtive character at which they would study the new testament
they even began to commit the epistles of st paul to memory in the original greek
they got up beveridge on the thirtynine articles and pearson on the creed in their hours of recreation they read more's mystery of godliness which ernest thought was charming and taylor's holy living and dying which also impressed him deeply through what he thought was the splendour of its language
they handed themselves over to the guidance of dean alford's notes on the greek testament which made ernest better understand what was meant by difficulties but also made him feel how shallow and impotent were the conclusions arrived at by german neologians with whose works being innocent of german he was not otherwise acquainted
some of the friends who joined him in these pursuits were johnians and the meetings were often held within the walls of st john's
i do not know how tidings of these furtive gatherings had reached the simeonites but they must have come round to them in some way for they had not been continued many weeks before a circular was sent to each of the young men who attended them informing them that the rev
gideon hawke a wellknown london evangelical preacher whose sermons were then much talked of was about to visit his young friend badcock of st john's and would be glad to say a few words to any who might wish to hear them in badcock's rooms on a certain evening in may
badcock was one of the most notorious of all the simeonites
not only was he ugly dirty illdressed bumptious and in every way objectionable but he was deformed and waddled when he walked so that he had won a nickname which i can only reproduce by calling it here's my back and there's my back because the lower parts of his back emphasised themselves demonstratively as though about to fly off in different directions like the two extreme notes in the chord of the augmented sixth with every step he took
it may be guessed therefore that the receipt of the circular had for a moment an almost paralysing effect on those to whom it was addressed owing to the astonishment which it occasioned them
it certainly was a daring surprise but like so many deformed people badcock was forward and hard to check he was a pushing fellow to whom the present was just the opportunity he wanted for carrying war into the enemy's quarters
ernest and his friends consulted
moved by the feeling that as they were now preparing to be clergymen they ought not to stand so stiffly on social dignity as heretofore and also perhaps by the desire to have a good private view of a preacher who was then much upon the lips of men they decided to accept the invitation
when the appointed time came they went with some confusion and selfabasement to the rooms of this man on whom they had looked down hitherto as from an immeasurable height and with whom nothing would have made them believe a few weeks earlier that they could ever come to be on speaking terms
mr hawke was a very differentlooking person from badcock
he was remarkably handsome or rather would have been but for the thinness of his lips and a look of too great firmness and inflexibility
his features were a good deal like those of leonardo da vinci moreover he was kempt looked in vigorous health and was of a ruddy countenance
he was extremely courteous in his manner and paid a good deal of attention to badcock of whom he seemed to think highly
altogether our young friends were taken aback and inclined to think smaller beer of themselves and larger of badcock than was agreeable to the old adam who was still alive within them
a few wellknown sims from st john's and other colleges were present but not enough to swamp the ernest set as for the sake of brevity i will call them
after a preliminary conversation in which there was nothing to offend the business of the evening began by mr hawke's standing up at one end of the table and saying let us pray
the ernest set did not like this but they could not help themselves so they knelt down and repeated the lord's prayer and a few others after mr hawke who delivered them remarkably well
then when all had sat down mr hawke addressed them speaking without notes and taking for his text the words saul saul why persecutest thou me
whether owing to mr hawke's manner which was impressive or to his wellknown reputation for ability or whether from the fact that each one of the ernest set knew that he had been more or less a persecutor of the sims and yet felt instinctively that the sims were after all much more like the early christians than he was himselfat any rate the text familiar though it was went home to the consciences of ernest and his friends as it had never yet done
if mr hawke had stopped here he would have almost said enough as he scanned the faces turned towards him and saw the impression he had made he was perhaps minded to bring his sermon to an end before beginning it but if so he reconsidered himself and proceeded as follows
i give the sermon in full for it is a typical one and will explain a state of mind which in another generation or two will seem to stand sadly in need of explanation
my young friends said mr hawke i am persuaded there is not one of you here who doubts the existence of a personal god
if there were it is to him assuredly that i should first address myself
should i be mistaken in my belief that all here assembled accept the existence of a god who is present amongst us though we see him not and whose eye is upon our most secret thoughts let me implore the doubter to confer with me in private before we part i will then put before him considerations through which god has been mercifully pleased to reveal himself to me so far as man can understand him and which i have found bring peace to the minds of others who have doubted
i assume also that there is none who doubts but that this god after whose likeness we have been made did in the course of time have pity upon man's blindness and assume our nature taking flesh and coming down and dwelling among us as a man indistinguishable physically from ourselves
he who made the sun moon and stars the world and all that therein is came down from heaven in the person of his son with the express purpose of leading a scorned life and dying the most cruel shameful death which fiendish ingenuity has invented
while on earth he worked many miracles
he gave sight to the blind raised the dead to life fed thousands with a few loaves and fishes and was seen to walk upon the waves but at the end of his appointed time he died as was foredetermined upon the cross and was buried by a few faithful friends
those however who had put him to death set a jealous watch over his tomb
there is no one i feel sure in this room who doubts any part of the foregoing but if there is let me again pray him to confer with me in private and i doubt not that by the blessing of god his doubts will cease
the next day but one after our lord was buried the tomb being still jealously guarded by enemies an angel was seen descending from heaven with glittering raiment and a countenance that shone like fire
this glorious being rolled away the stone from the grave and our lord himself came forth risen from the dead
my young friends this is no fanciful story like those of the ancient deities but a matter of plain history as certain as that you and i are now here together
if there is one fact better vouched for than another in the whole range of certainties it is the resurrection of jesus christ nor is it less well assured that a few weeks after he had risen from the dead our lord was seen by many hundreds of men and women to rise amid a host of angels into the air upon a heavenward journey till the clouds covered him and concealed him from the sight of men
it may be said that the truth of these statements has been denied but what let me ask you has become of the questioners
where are they now
do we see them or hear of them
have they been able to hold what little ground they made during the supineness of the last century
is there one of your fathers or mothers or friends who does not see through them
is there a single teacher or preacher in this great university who has not examined what these men had to say and found it naught
did you ever meet one of them or do you find any of their books securing the respectful attention of those competent to judge concerning them
i think not and i think also you know as well as i do why it is that they have sunk back into the abyss from which they for a time emerged it is because after the most careful and patient examination by the ablest and most judicial minds of many countries their arguments were found so untenable that they themselves renounced them
they fled from the field routed dismayed and suing for peace nor have they again come to the front in any civilised country
you know these things
why then do i insist upon them
my dear young friends your own consciousness will have made the answer to each one of you already it is because though you know so well that these things did verily and indeed happen you know also that you have not realised them to yourselves as it was your duty to do nor heeded their momentous awful import
and now let me go further
you all know that you will one day come to die or if not to diefor there are not wanting signs which make me hope that the lord may come again while some of us now present are aliveyet to be changed for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible for this corruption must put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality and the saying shall be brought to pass that is written 'death is swallowed up in victory'
do you or do you not believe that you will one day stand before the judgement seat of christ
do you or do you not believe that you will have to give an account for every idle word that you have ever spoken
do you or do you not believe that you are called to live not according to the will of man but according to the will of that christ who came down from heaven out of love for you who suffered and died for you who calls you to him and yearns towards you that you may take heed even in this your daybut who if you heed not will also one day judge you and with whom there is no variableness nor shadow of turning
my dear young friends strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth to eternal life and few there be that find it
few few few for he who will not give up all for christ's sake has given up nothing
if you would live in the friendship of this world if indeed you are not prepared to give up everything you most fondly cherish should the lord require it of you then i say put the idea of christ deliberately on one side at once
spit upon him buffet him crucify him anew do anything you like so long as you secure the friendship of this world while it is still in your power to do so the pleasures of this brief life may not be worth paying for by the torments of eternity but they are something while they last
if on the other hand you would live in the friendship of god and be among the number of those for whom christ has not died in vain if in a word you value your eternal welfare then give up the friendship of this world of a surety you must make your choice between god and mammon for you cannot serve both
i put these considerations before you if so homely a term may be pardoned as a plain matter of business
there is nothing low or unworthy in this as some lately have pretended for all nature shows us that there is nothing more acceptable to god than an enlightened view of our own selfinterest never let anyone delude you here it is a simple question of fact did certain things happen or did they not
if they did happen is it reasonable to suppose that you will make yourselves and others more happy by one course of conduct or by another
and now let me ask you what answer you have made to this question hitherto
whose friendship have you chosen
if knowing what you know you have not yet begun to act according to the immensity of the knowledge that is in you then he who builds his house and lays up his treasure on the edge of a crater of molten lava is a sane sensible person in comparison with yourselves
i say this as no figure of speech or bugbear with which to frighten you but as an unvarnished unexaggerated statement which will be no more disputed by yourselves than by me
and now mr hawke who up to this time had spoken with singular quietness changed his manner to one of greater warmth and continued  oh
my young friends turn turn turn now while it is called todaynow from this hour from this instant stay not even to gird up your loins look not behind you for a second but fly into the bosom of that christ who is to be found of all who seek him and from that fearful wrath of god which lieth in wait for those who know not the things belonging to their peace
for the son of man cometh as a thief in the night and there is not one of us can tell but what this day his soul may be required of him
if there is even one here who has heeded meand he let his eye fall for an instant upon almost all his hearers but especially on the ernest seti shall know that it was not for nothing that i felt the call of the lord and heard as i thought a voice by night that bade me come hither quickly for there was a chosen vessel who had need of me
here mr hawke ended rather abruptly his earnest manner striking countenance and excellent delivery had produced an effect greater than the actual words i have given can convey to the reader the virtue lay in the man more than in what he said as for the last few mysterious words about his having heard a voice by night their effect was magical there was not one who did not look down to the ground nor who in his heart did not half believe that he was the chosen vessel on whose especial behalf god had sent mr hawke to cambridge
even if this were not so each one of them felt that he was now for the first time in the actual presence of one who had had a direct communication from the almighty and they were thus suddenly brought a hundredfold nearer to the new testament miracles
they were amazed not to say scared and as though by tacit consent they gathered together thanked mr hawke for his sermon said goodnight in a humble deferential manner to badcock and the other simeonites and left the room together
they had heard nothing but what they had been hearing all their lives how was it then that they were so dumbfoundered by it
i suppose partly because they had lately begun to think more seriously and were in a fit state to be impressed partly from the greater directness with which each felt himself addressed through the sermon being delivered in a room and partly to the logical consistency freedom from exaggeration and profound air of conviction with which mr hawke had spoken
his simplicity and obvious earnestness had impressed them even before he had alluded to his special mission but this clenched everything and the words lord is it i
were upon the hearts of each as they walked pensively home through moonlit courts and cloisters
i do not know what passed among the simeonites after the ernest set had left them but they would have been more than mortal if they had not been a good deal elated with the results of the evening
why one of ernest's friends was in the university eleven and he had actually been in badcock's rooms and had slunk off on saying goodnight as meekly as any of them
it was no small thing to have scored a success like this
chapter l   ernest felt now that the turning point of his life had come
he would give up all for christeven his tobacco
so he gathered together his pipes and pouches and locked them up in his portmanteau under his bed where they should be out of sight and as much out of mind as possible
he did not burn them because someone might come in who wanted to smoke and though he might abridge his own liberty yet as smoking was not a sin there was no reason why he should be hard on other people
after breakfast he left his rooms to call on a man named dawson who had been one of mr hawke's hearers on the preceding evening and who was reading for ordination at the forthcoming ember weeks now only four months distant
this man had been always of a rather serious turn of minda little too much so for ernest's taste but times had changed and dawson's undoubted sincerity seemed to render him a fitting counsellor for ernest at the present time
as he was going through the first court of john's on his way to dawson's rooms he met badcock and greeted him with some deference
his advance was received with one of those ecstatic gleams which shone occasionally upon the face of badcock and which if ernest had known more would have reminded him of robespierre
as it was he saw it and unconsciously recognised the unrest and selfseekingness of the man but could not yet formulate them he disliked badcock more than ever but as he was going to profit by the spiritual benefits which he had put in his way he was bound to be civil to him and civil he therefore was
badcock told him that mr hawke had returned to town immediately his discourse was over but that before doing so he had enquired particularly who ernest and two or three others were
i believe each one of ernest's friends was given to understand that he had been more or less particularly enquired after
ernest's vanityfor he was his mother's sonwas tickled at this the idea again presented itself to him that he might be the one for whose benefit mr hawke had been sent
there was something too in badcock's manner which conveyed the idea that he could say more if he chose but had been enjoined to silence
on reaching dawson's rooms he found his friend in raptures over the discourse of the preceding evening
hardly less delighted was he with the effect it had produced on ernest
he had always known he said that ernest would come round he had been sure of it but he had hardly expected the conversion to be so sudden
ernest said no more had he but now that he saw his duty so clearly he would get ordained as soon as possible and take a curacy even though the doing so would make him have to go down from cambridge earlier which would be a great grief to him
dawson applauded this determination and it was arranged that as ernest was still more or less of a weak brother dawson should take him so to speak in spiritual tow for a while and strengthen and confirm his faith
an offensive and defensive alliance therefore was struck up between this pair who were in reality singularly ill assorted and ernest set to work to master the books on which the bishop would examine him
others gradually joined them till they formed a small set or church for these are the same things and the effect of mr hawke's sermon instead of wearing off in a few days as might have been expected became more and more marked so much so that it was necessary for ernest's friends to hold him back rather than urge him on for he seemed likely to developas indeed he did for a timeinto a religious enthusiast
in one matter only did he openly backslide
he had as i said above locked up his pipes and tobacco so that he might not be tempted to use them
all day long on the day after mr hawke's sermon he let them lie in his portmanteau bravely but this was not very difficult as he had for some time given up smoking till after hall
after hall this day he did not smoke till chapel time and then went to chapel in selfdefence
when he returned he determined to look at the matter from a common sense point of view
on this he saw that provided tobacco did not injure his healthand he really could not see that it didit stood much on the same footing as tea or coffee
tobacco had nowhere been forbidden in the bible but then it had not yet been discovered and had probably only escaped proscription for this reason
we can conceive of st paul or even our lord himself as drinking a cup of tea but we cannot imagine either of them as smoking a cigarette or a churchwarden
ernest could not deny this and admitted that paul would almost certainly have condemned tobacco in good round terms if he had known of its existence
was it not then taking rather a mean advantage of the apostle to stand on his not having actually forbidden it
on the other hand it was possible that god knew paul would have forbidden smoking and had purposely arranged the discovery of tobacco for a period at which paul should be no longer living
this might seem rather hard on paul considering all he had done for christianity but it would be made up to him in other ways
these reflections satisfied ernest that on the whole he had better smoke so he sneaked to his portmanteau and brought out his pipes and tobacco again
there should be moderation he felt in all things even in virtue so for that night he smoked immoderately
it was a pity however that he had bragged to dawson about giving up smoking
the pipes had better be kept in a cupboard for a week or two till in other and easier respects ernest should have proved his steadfastness
then they might steal out again little by littleand so they did
ernest now wrote home a letter couched in a vein different from his ordinary ones
his letters were usually all common form and padding for as i have already explained if he wrote about anything that really interested him his mother always wanted to know more and more about itevery fresh answer being as the lopping off of a hydra's head and giving birth to half a dozen or more new questionsbut in the end it came invariably to the same result namely that he ought to have done something else or ought not to go on doing as he proposed
now however there was a new departure and for the thousandth time he concluded that he was about to take a course of which his father and mother would approve and in which they would be interested so that at last he and they might get on more sympathetically than heretofore
he therefore wrote a gushing impulsive letter which afforded much amusement to myself as i read it but which is too long for reproduction
one passage ran i am now going towards christ the greater number of my college friends are i fear going away from him we must pray for them that they may find the peace that is in christ even as i have myself found it
ernest covered his face with his hands for shame as he read this extract from the bundle of letters he had put into my handsthey had been returned to him by his father on his mother's death his mother having carefully preserved them
shall i cut it out
said i i will if you like
certainly not he answered and if goodnatured friends have kept more records of my follies pick out any plums that may amuse the reader and let him have his laugh over them
but fancy what effect a letter like thisso unled up tomust have produced at battersby
even christina refrained from ecstasy over her son's having discovered the power of christ's word while theobald was frightened out of his wits
it was well his son was not going to have any doubts or difficulties and that he would be ordained without making a fuss over it but he smelt mischief in this sudden conversion of one who had never yet shown any inclination towards religion
he hated people who did not know where to stop
ernest was always so outre and strange there was never any knowing what he would do next except that it would be something unusual and silly
if he was to get the bit between his teeth after he had got ordained and bought his living he would play more pranks than ever he theobald had done
the fact doubtless of his being ordained and having bought a living would go a long way to steady him and if he married his wife must see to the rest this was his only chance and to do justice to his sagacity theobald in his heart did not think very highly of it
when ernest came down to battersby in june he imprudently tried to open up a more unreserved communication with his father than was his wont
the first of ernest's snipelike flights on being flushed by mr hawke's sermon was in the direction of ultraevangelicalism
theobald himself had been much more low than high church
this was the normal development of the country clergyman during the first years of his clerical life between we will say the years  to  but he was not prepared for the almost contempt with which ernest now regarded the doctrines of baptismal regeneration and priestly absolution hoity toity indeed what business had he with such questions
 nor for his desire to find some means of reconciling methodism and the church
theobald hated the church of rome but he hated dissenters too for he found them as a general rule troublesome people to deal with he always found people who did not agree with him troublesome to deal with besides they set up for knowing as much as he did nevertheless if he had been let alone he would have leaned towards them rather than towards the high church party
the neighbouring clergy however would not let him alone
one by one they had come under the influence directly or indirectly of the oxford movement which had begun twenty years earlier
it was surprising how many practices he now tolerated which in his youth he would have considered popish he knew very well therefore which way things were going in church matters and saw that as usual ernest was setting himself the other way
the opportunity for telling his son that he was a fool was too favourable not to be embraced and theobald was not slow to embrace it
ernest was annoyed and surprised for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life
now that he had become so they were still not satisfied
he said to himself that a prophet was not without honour save in his own country but he had been latelyor rather until latelygetting into an odious habit of turning proverbs upside down and it occurred to him that a country is sometimes not without honour save for its own prophet
then he laughed and for the rest of the day felt more as he used to feel before he had heard mr hawke's sermon
he returned to cambridge for the long vacation of none too soon for he had to go in for the voluntary theological examination which bishops were now beginning to insist upon
he imagined all the time he was reading that he was storing himself with the knowledge that would best fit him for the work he had taken in hand
in truth he was cramming for a pass
in due time he did passcreditably and was ordained deacon with halfadozen others of his friends in the autumn of 
he was then just twentythree years old
chapter li   ernest had been ordained to a curacy in one of the central parts of london
he hardly knew anything of london yet but his instincts drew him thither
the day after he was ordained he entered upon his dutiesfeeling much as his father had done when he found himself boxed up in the carriage with christina on the morning of his marriage
before the first three days were over he became aware that the light of the happiness which he had known during his four years at cambridge had been extinguished and he was appalled by the irrevocable nature of the step which he now felt that he had taken much too hurriedly
the most charitable excuse that i can make for the vagaries which it will now be my duty to chronicle is that the shock of change consequent upon his becoming suddenly religious being ordained and leaving cambridge had been too much for my hero and had for the time thrown him off an equilibrium which was yet little supported by experience and therefore as a matter of course unstable
everyone has a mass of bad work in him which he will have to work off and get rid of before he can do betterand indeed the more lasting a man's ultimate good work is the more sure he is to pass through a time and perhaps a very long one in which there seems very little hope for him at all
we must all sow our spiritual wild oats
the fault i feel personally disposed to find with my godson is not that he had wild oats to sow but that they were such an exceedingly tame and uninteresting crop
the sense of humour and tendency to think for himself of which till a few months previously he had been showing fair promise were nipped as though by a late frost while his earlier habit of taking on trust everything that was told him by those in authority and following everything out to the bitter end no matter how preposterous returned with redoubled strength
i suppose this was what might have been expected from anyone placed as ernest now was especially when his antecedents are remembered but it surprised and disappointed some of his coolerheaded cambridge friends who had begun to think well of his ability
to himself it seemed that religion was incompatible with half measures or even with compromise
circumstances had led to his being ordained for the moment he was sorry they had but he had done it and must go through with it
he therefore set himself to find out what was expected of him and to act accordingly
his rector was a moderate high churchman of no very pronounced viewsan elderly man who had had too many curates not to have long since found out that the connection between rector and curate like that between employer and employed in every other walk of life was a mere matter of business
he had now two curates of whom ernest was the junior the senior curate was named pryer and when this gentleman made advances as he presently did ernest in his forlorn state was delighted to meet them
pryer was about twentyeight years old
he had been at eton and at oxford
he was tall and passed generally for goodlooking i only saw him once for about five minutes and then thought him odious both in manners and appearance
perhaps it was because he caught me up in a way i did not like
i had quoted shakespeare for lack of something better to fill up a sentenceand had said that one touch of nature made the whole world kin
ah said pryer in a bold brazen way which displeased me but one touch of the unnatural makes it more kindred still and he gave me a look as though he thought me an old bore and did not care two straws whether i was shocked or not
naturally enough after this i did not like him
this however is anticipating for it was not till ernest had been three or four months in london that i happened to meet his fellowcurate and i must deal here rather with the effect he produced upon my godson than upon myself
besides being what was generally considered goodlooking he was faultless in his getup and altogether the kind of man whom ernest was sure to be afraid of and yet be taken in by
the style of his dress was very high church and his acquaintances were exclusively of the extreme high church party but he kept his views a good deal in the background in his rector's presence and that gentleman though he looked askance on some of pryer's friends had no such ground of complaint against him as to make him sever the connection
pryer too was popular in the pulpit and take him all round it was probable that many worse curates would be found for one better
when pryer called on my hero as soon as the two were alone together he eyed him all over with a quick penetrating glance and seemed not dissatisfied with the resultfor i must say here that ernest had improved in personal appearance under the more genial treatment he had received at cambridge
pryer in fact approved of him sufficiently to treat him civilly and ernest was immediately won by anyone who did this
it was not long before he discovered that the high church party and even rome itself had more to say for themselves than he had thought
this was his first snipelike change of flight
pryer introduced him to several of his friends
they were all of them young clergymen belonging as i have said to the highest of the high church school but ernest was surprised to find how much they resembled other people when among themselves
this was a shock to him it was ere long a still greater one to find that certain thoughts which he had warred against as fatal to his soul and which he had imagined he should lose once for all on ordination were still as troublesome to him as they had been he also saw plainly enough that the young gentlemen who formed the circle of pryer's friends were in much the same unhappy predicament as himself
this was deplorable
the only way out of it that ernest could see was that he should get married at once
but then he did not know any one whom he wanted to marry
he did not know any woman in fact whom he would not rather die than marry
it had been one of theobald's and christina's main objects to keep him out of the way of women and they had so far succeeded that women had become to him mysterious inscrutable objects to be tolerated when it was impossible to avoid them but never to be sought out or encouraged
as for any man loving or even being at all fond of any woman he supposed it was so but he believed the greater number of those who professed such sentiments were liars
now however it was clear that he had hoped against hope too long and that the only thing to do was to go and ask the first woman who would listen to him to come and be married to him as soon as possible
he broached this to pryer and was surprised to find that this gentleman though attentive to such members of his flock as were young and goodlooking was strongly in favour of the celibacy of the clergy as indeed were the other demure young clerics to whom pryer had introduced ernest
chapter lii   you know my dear pontifex said pryer to him some few weeks after ernest had become acquainted with him when the two were taking a constitutional one day in kensington gardens you know my dear pontifex it is all very well to quarrel with rome but rome has reduced the treatment of the human soul to a science while our own church though so much purer in many respects has no organised system either of diagnosis or pathologyi mean of course spiritual diagnosis and spiritual pathology
our church does not prescribe remedies upon any settled system and what is still worse even when her physicians have according to their lights ascertained the disease and pointed out the remedy she has no discipline which will ensure its being actually applied
if our patients do not choose to do as we tell them we cannot make them
perhaps really under all the circumstances this is as well for we are spiritually mere horse doctors as compared with the roman priesthood nor can we hope to make much headway against the sin and misery that surround us till we return in some respects to the practice of our forefathers and of the greater part of christendom
ernest asked in what respects it was that his friend desired a return to the practice of our forefathers
why my dear fellow can you really be ignorant
it is just this either the priest is indeed a spiritual guide as being able to show people how they ought to live better than they can find out for themselves or he is nothing at allhe has no raison d'etre
if the priest is not as much a healer and director of men's souls as a physician is of their bodies what is he
the history of all ages has shownand surely you must know this as well as i dothat as men cannot cure the bodies of their patients if they have not been properly trained in hospitals under skilled teachers so neither can souls be cured of their more hidden ailments without the help of men who are skilled in soulcraftor in other words of priests
what do one half of our formularies and rubrics mean if not this
how in the name of all that is reasonable can we find out the exact nature of a spiritual malady unless we have had experience of other similar cases
how can we get this without express training
at present we have to begin all experiments for ourselves without profiting by the organised experience of our predecessors inasmuch as that experience is never organised and coordinated at all
at the outset therefore each one of us must ruin many souls which could be saved by knowledge of a few elementary principles
ernest was very much impressed
as for men curing themselves continued pryer they can no more cure their own souls than they can cure their own bodies or manage their own law affairs
in these two last cases they see the folly of meddling with their own cases clearly enough and go to a professional adviser as a matter of course surely a man's soul is at once a more difficult and intricate matter to treat and at the same time it is more important to him that it should be treated rightly than that either his body or his money should be so
what are we to think of the practice of a church which encourages people to rely on unprofessional advice in matters affecting their eternal welfare when they would not think of jeopardising their worldly affairs by such insane conduct
ernest could see no weak place in this
these ideas had crossed his own mind vaguely before now but he had never laid hold of them or set them in an orderly manner before himself
nor was he quick at detecting false analogies and the misuse of metaphors in fact he was a mere child in the hands of his fellow curate
and what resumed pryer does all this point to
firstly to the duty of confessionthe outcry against which is absurd as an outcry would be against dissection as part of the training of medical students
granted these young men must see and do a great deal we do not ourselves like even to think of but they should adopt some other profession unless they are prepared for this they may even get inoculated with poison from a dead body and lose their lives but they must stand their chance
so if we aspire to be priests in deed as well as name we must familiarise ourselves with the minutest and most repulsive details of all kinds of sin so that we may recognise it in all its stages
some of us must doubtlessly perish spiritually in such investigations
we cannot help it all science must have its martyrs and none of these will deserve better of humanity than those who have fallen in the pursuit of spiritual pathology
ernest grew more and more interested but in the meekness of his soul said nothing
i do not desire this martyrdom for myself continued the other on the contrary i will avoid it to the very utmost of my power but if it be god's will that i should fall while studying what i believe most calculated to advance his glorythen i say not my will oh lord but thine be done
this was too much even for ernest
i heard of an irishwoman once he said with a smile who said she was a martyr to the drink
and so she was rejoined pryer with warmth and he went on to show that this good woman was an experimentalist whose experiment though disastrous in its effects upon herself was pregnant with instruction to other people
she was thus a true martyr or witness to the frightful consequences of intemperance to the saving doubtless of many who but for her martyrdom would have taken to drinking
she was one of a forlorn hope whose failure to take a certain position went to the proving it to be impregnable and therefore to the abandonment of all attempt to take it
this was almost as great a gain to mankind as the actual taking of the position would have been
besides he added more hurriedly the limits of vice and virtue are wretchedly illdefined
half the vices which the world condemns most loudly have seeds of good in them and require moderate use rather than total abstinence
ernest asked timidly for an instance
no no said pryer i will give you no instance but i will give you a formula that shall embrace all instances
it is this that no practice is entirely vicious which has not been extinguished among the comeliest most vigorous and most cultivated races of mankind in spite of centuries of endeavour to extirpate it
if a vice in spite of such efforts can still hold its own among the most polished nations it must be founded on some immutable truth or fact in human nature and must have some compensatory advantage which we cannot afford altogether to dispense with
but said ernest timidly is not this virtually doing away with all distinction between right and wrong and leaving people without any moral guide whatever
not the people was the answer it must be our care to be guides to these for they are and always will be incapable of guiding themselves sufficiently
we should tell them what they must do and in an ideal state of things should be able to enforce their doing it perhaps when we are better instructed the ideal state may come about nothing will so advance it as greater knowledge of spiritual pathology on our own part
for this three things are necessary firstly absolute freedom in experiment for us the clergy secondly absolute knowledge of what the laity think and do and of what thoughts and actions result in what spiritual conditions and thirdly a compacter organisation among ourselves
if we are to do any good we must be a closely united body and must be sharply divided from the laity
also we must be free from those ties which a wife and children involve
i can hardly express the horror with which i am filled by seeing english priests living in what i can only designate as 'open matrimony'
it is deplorable
the priest must be absolutely sexlessif not in practice yet at any rate in theory absolutelyand that too by a theory so universally accepted that none shall venture to dispute it
but said ernest has not the bible already told people what they ought and ought not to do and is it not enough for us to insist on what can be found here and let the rest alone
if you begin with the bible was the rejoinder you are three parts gone on the road to infidelity and will go the other part before you know where you are
the bible is not without its value to us the clergy but for the laity it is a stumblingblock which cannot be taken out of their way too soon or too completely
of course i mean on the supposition that they read it which happily they seldom do
if people read the bible as the ordinary british churchman or churchwoman reads it it is harmless enough but if they read it with any carewhich we should assume they will if we give it them at allit is fatal to them
what do you mean
said ernest more and more astonished but more and more feeling that he was at least in the hands of a man who had definite ideas
your question shows me that you have never read your bible
a more unreliable book was never put upon paper
take my advice and don't read it not till you are a few years older and may do so safely
but surely you believe the bible when it tells you of such things as that christ died and rose from the dead
surely you believe this
said ernest quite prepared to be told that pryer believed nothing of the kind
i do not believe it i know it
but howif the testimony of the bible fails
on that of the living voice of the church which i know to be infallible and to be informed of christ himself
chapter liii   the foregoing conversation and others like it made a deep impression upon my hero
if next day he had taken a walk with mr hawke and heard what he had to say on the other side he would have been just as much struck and as ready to fling off what pryer had told him as he now was to throw aside all he had ever heard from anyone except pryer but there was no mr hawke at hand so pryer had everything his own way
embryo minds like embryo bodies pass through a number of strange metamorphoses before they adopt their final shape
it is no more to be wondered at that one who is going to turn out a roman catholic should have passed through the stages of being first a methodist and then a free thinker than that a man should at some former time have been a mere cell and later on an invertebrate animal
ernest however could not be expected to know this embryos never do
embryos think with each stage of their development that they have now reached the only condition which really suits them
this they say must certainly be their last inasmuch as its close will be so great a shock that nothing can survive it
every change is a shock every shock is a pro tanto death
what we call death is only a shock great enough to destroy our power to recognise a past and a present as resembling one another
it is the making us consider the points of difference between our present and our past greater than the points of resemblance so that we can no longer call the former of these two in any proper sense a continuation of the second but find it less trouble to think of it as something that we choose to call new
but to let this pass it was clear that spiritual pathology i confess that i do not know myself what spiritual pathology meansbut pryer and ernest doubtless did was the great desideratum of the age
it seemed to ernest that he had made this discovery himself and been familiar with it all his life that he had never known in fact of anything else
he wrote long letters to his college friends expounding his views as though he had been one of the apostolic fathers
as for the old testament writers he had no patience with them
do oblige me i find him writing to one friend by reading the prophet zechariah and giving me your candid opinion upon him
he is poor stuff full of yankee bounce it is sickening to live in an age when such balderdash can be gravely admired whether as poetry or prophecy
this was because pryer had set him against zechariah
i do not know what zechariah had done i should think myself that zechariah was a very good prophet perhaps it was because he was a bible writer and not a very prominent one that pryer selected him as one through whom to disparage the bible in comparison with the church
to his friend dawson i find him saying a little later on pryer and i continue our walks working out each other's thoughts
at first he used to do all the thinking but i think i am pretty well abreast of him now and rather chuckle at seeing that he is already beginning to modify some of the views he held most strongly when i first knew him
then i think he was on the high road to rome now however he seems to be a good deal struck with a suggestion of mine in which you too perhaps may be interested
you see we must infuse new life into the church somehow we are not holding our own against either rome or infidelity
i may say in passing that i do not believe ernest had as yet ever seen an infidelnot to speak to
i proposed therefore a few days back to pryerand he fell in eagerly with the proposal as soon as he saw that i had the means of carrying it outthat we should set on foot a spiritual movement somewhat analogous to the young england movement of twenty years ago the aim of which shall be at once to outbid rome on the one hand and scepticism on the other
for this purpose i see nothing better than the foundation of an institution or college for placing the nature and treatment of sin on a more scientific basis than it rests at present
we wantto borrow a useful term of pryer'sa college of spiritual pathology where young men i suppose ernest thought he was no longer young by this time may study the nature and treatment of the sins of the soul as medical students study those of the bodies of their patients
such a college as you will probably admit will approach both rome on the one hand and science on the otherrome as giving the priesthood more skill and therefore as paving the way for their obtaining greater power and science by recognising that even free thought has a certain kind of value in spiritual enquiries
to this purpose pryer and i have resolved to devote ourselves henceforth heart and soul
of course my ideas are still unshaped and all will depend upon the men by whom the college is first worked
i am not yet a priest but pryer is and if i were to start the college pryer might take charge of it for a time and i work under him nominally as his subordinate
pryer himself suggested this
is it not generous of him
the worst of it is that we have not enough money i have it is true  pounds but we want at least  pounds so pryer says before we can start when we are fairly under weigh i might live at the college and draw a salary from the foundation so that it is all one or nearly so whether i invest my money in this way or in buying a living besides i want very little it is certain that i shall never marry no clergyman should think of this and an unmarried man can live on next to nothing
still i do not see my way to as much money as i want and pryer suggests that as we can hardly earn more now we must get it by a judicious series of investments
pryer knows several people who make quite a handsome income out of very little or indeed i may say nothing at all by buying things at a place they call the stock exchange i don't know much about it yet but pryer says i should soon learn he thinks indeed that i have shown rather a talent in this direction and under proper auspices should make a very good man of business
others of course and not i must decide this but a man can do anything if he gives his mind to it and though i should not care about having more money for my own sake i care about it very much when i think of the good i could do with it by saving souls from such horrible torture hereafter
why if the thing succeeds and i really cannot see what is to hinder it it is hardly possible to exaggerate its importance nor the proportions which it may ultimately assume etc etc
again i asked ernest whether he minded my printing this
he winced but said no not if it helps you to tell your story but don't you think it is too long
i said it would let the reader see for himself how things were going in half the time that it would take me to explain them to him
very well then keep it by all means
i continue turning over my file of ernest's letters and find as follows     thanks for your last in answer to which i send you a rough copy of a    letter i sent to the times a day or two back
they did not insert    it but it embodies pretty fully my ideas on the parochial visitation    question and pryer fully approves of the letter
think it carefully    over and send it back to me when read for it is so exactly my present    creed that i cannot afford to lose it
i should very much like to have a viva voce discussion on these    matters i can only see for certain that we have suffered a dreadful    loss in being no longer able to excommunicate
we should    excommunicate rich and poor alike and pretty freely too
if this    power were restored to us we could i think soon put a stop to by far    the greater part of the sin and misery with which we are surrounded
these letters were written only a few weeks after ernest had been ordained but they are nothing to others that he wrote a little later on
in his eagerness to regenerate the church of england and through this the universe by the means which pryer had suggested to him it occurred to him to try to familiarise himself with the habits and thoughts of the poor by going and living among them
i think he got this notion from kingsley's alton locke which high churchman though he for the nonce was he had devoured as he had devoured stanley's life of arnold dickens's novels and whatever other literary garbage of the day was most likely to do him harm at any rate he actually put his scheme into practice and took lodgings in ashpit place a small street in the neighbourhood of drury lane theatre in a house of which the landlady was the widow of a cabman
this lady occupied the whole ground floor
in the front kitchen there was a tinker
the back kitchen was let to a bellowsmender
on the first floor came ernest with his two rooms which he furnished comfortably for one must draw the line somewhere
the two upper floors were parcelled out among four different sets of lodgers there was a tailor named holt a drunken fellow who used to beat his wife at night till her screams woke the house above him there was another tailor with a wife but no children these people were wesleyans given to drink but not noisy
the two back rooms were held by single ladies who it seemed to ernest must be respectably connected for welldressed gentlemanly looking young men used to go up and down stairs past ernest's rooms to call at any rate on miss snowernest had heard her door slam after they had passed
he thought too that some of them went up to miss maitland's
mrs jupp the landlady told ernest that these were brothers and cousins of miss snow's and that she was herself looking out for a situation as a governess but at present had an engagement as an actress at the drury lane theatre
ernest asked whether miss maitland in the top back was also looking out for a situation and was told she was wanting an engagement as a milliner
he believed whatever mrs jupp told him
chapter liv   this move on ernest's part was variously commented upon by his friends the general opinion being that it was just like pontifex who was sure to do something unusual wherever he went but that on the whole the idea was commendable
christina could not restrain herself when on sounding her clerical neighbours she found them inclined to applaud her son for conduct which they idealised into something much more selfdenying than it really was
she did not quite like his living in such an unaristocratic neighbourhood but what he was doing would probably get into the newspapers and then great people would take notice of him
besides it would be very cheap down among these poor people he could live for next to nothing and might put by a great deal of his income
as for temptations there could be few or none in such a place as that
this argument about cheapness was the one with which she most successfully met theobald who grumbled more suo that he had no sympathy with his son's extravagance and conceit
when christina pointed out to him that it would be cheap he replied that there was something in that
on ernest himself the effect was to confirm the good opinion of himself which had been growing upon him ever since he had begun to read for orders and to make him flatter himself that he was among the few who were ready to give up all for christ
ere long he began to conceive of himself as a man with a mission and a great future
his lightest and most hastily formed opinions began to be of momentous importance to him and he inflicted them as i have already shown on his old friends week by week becoming more and more entete with himself and his own crotchets
i should like well enough to draw a veil over this part of my hero's career but cannot do so without marring my story
in the spring of  i find him writing     i cannot call the visible church christian till its fruits are    christian that is until the fruits of the members of the church of    england are in conformity or something like conformity with her    teaching
i cordially agree with the teaching of the church of    england in most respects but she says one thing and does another and    until excommunicationyes and wholesale excommunicationbe resorted    to i cannot call her a christian institution
i should begin with    our rector and if i found it necessary to follow him up by    excommunicating the bishop i should not flinch even from this
the present london rectors are hopeless people to deal with
my own    is one of the best of them but the moment pryer and i show signs of    wanting to attack an evil in a way not recognised by routine or of    remedying anything about which no outcry has been made we are met    with 'i cannot think what you mean by all this disturbance nobody    else among the clergy sees these things and i have no wish to be the    first to begin turning everything topsyturvy'
and then people call    him a sensible man
i have no patience with them
however we know    what we want and as i wrote to dawson the other day have a scheme    on foot which will i think fairly meet the requirements of the case
but we want more money and my first move towards getting this has not    turned out quite so satisfactorily as pryer and i had hoped we shall    however i doubt not retrieve it shortly
when ernest came to london he intended doing a good deal of housetohouse visiting but pryer had talked him out of this even before he settled down in his new and strangelychosen apartments
the line he now took was that if people wanted christ they must prove their want by taking some little trouble and the trouble required of them was that they should come and seek him ernest out there he was in the midst of them ready to teach if people did not choose to come to him it was no fault of his
my great business here he writes again to dawson is to observe
i am not doing much in parish work beyond my share of the daily services
i have a man's bible class and a boy's bible class and a good many young men and boys to whom i give instruction one way or another then there are the sunday school children with whom i fill my room on a sunday evening as full as it will hold and let them sing hymns and chants
they like this
i do a great deal of readingchiefly of books which pryer and i think most likely to help we find nothing comparable to the jesuits
pryer is a thorough gentleman and an admirable man of businessno less observant of the things of this world in fact than of the things above by a brilliant coup he has retrieved or nearly so a rather serious loss which threatened to delay indefinitely the execution of our great scheme
he and i daily gather fresh principles
i believe great things are before me and am strong in the hope of being able by and by to effect much
as for you i bid you god speed
be bold but logical speculative but cautious daringly courageous but properly circumspect withal etc etc
i think this may do for the present
chapter lv   i had called on ernest as a matter of course when he first came to london but had not seen him
i had been out when he returned my call so that he had been in town for some weeks before i actually saw him which i did not very long after he had taken possession of his new rooms
i liked his face but except for the common bond of music in respect of which our tastes were singularly alike i should hardly have known how to get on with him
to do him justice he did not air any of his schemes to me until i had drawn him out concerning them
i to borrow the words of ernest's landlady mrs jupp am not a very regular churchgoeri discovered upon crossexamination that mrs jupp had been to church once when she was churched for her son tom some five and twenty years since but never either before or afterwards not even i fear to be married for though she called herself mrs she wore no wedding ring and spoke of the person who should have been mr jupp as my poor dear boy's father not as my husband
but to return
i was vexed at ernest's having been ordained
i was not ordained myself and i did not like my friends to be ordained nor did i like having to be on my best behaviour and to look as if butter would not melt in my mouth and all for a boy whom i remembered when he knew yesterday and tomorrow and tuesday but not a day of the week morenot even sunday itselfand when he said he did not like the kitten because it had pins in its toes
i looked at him and thought of his aunt alethea and how fast the money she had left him was accumulating and it was all to go to this young man who would use it probably in the very last ways with which miss pontifex would have sympathised
i was annoyed
she always said i thought to myself that she should make a mess of it but i did not think she would have made as great a mess of it as this
then i thought that perhaps if his aunt had lived he would not have been like this
ernest behaved quite nicely to me and i own that the fault was mine if the conversation drew towards dangerous subjects
i was the aggressor presuming i suppose upon my age and long acquaintance with him as giving me a right to make myself unpleasant in a quiet way
then he came out and the exasperating part of it was that up to a certain point he was so very right
grant him his premises and his conclusions were sound enough nor could i seeing that he was already ordained join issue with him about his premises as i should certainly have done if i had had a chance of doing so before he had taken orders
the result was that i had to beat a retreat and went away not in the best of humours
i believe the truth was that i liked ernest and was vexed at his being a clergyman and at a clergyman having so much money coming to him
i talked a little with mrs jupp on my way out
she and i had reckoned one another up at first sight as being neither of us very regular church goers and the strings of her tongue had been loosened
she said ernest would die
he was much too good for the world and he looked so sad just like young watkins of the 'crown' over the way who died a month ago and his poor dear skin was white as alablaster leastways they say he shot hisself
they took him from the mortimer i met them just as i was going with my rose to get a pint o' four ale and she had her arm in splints
she told her sister she wanted to go to perry's to get some wool instead o' which it was only a stall to get me a pint o' ale bless her heart there's nobody else would do that much for poor old jupp and it's a horrid lie to say she is gay not but what i like a gay woman i do i'd rather give a gay woman halfacrown than stand a modest woman a pot o' beer but i don't want to go associating with bad girls for all that
so they took him from the mortimer they wouldn't let him go home no more and he done it that artful you know
his wife was in the country living with her mother and she always spoke respectful o' my rose
poor dear i hope his soul is in heaven
well sir would you believe it there's that in mr pontifex's face which is just like young watkins he looks that worrited and scrunched up at times but it's never for the same reason for he don't know nothing at all no more than a unborn babe no he don't why there's not a monkey going about london with an italian organ grinder but knows more than mr pontifex do
he don't knowwell i suppose  here a child came in on an errand from some neighbour and interrupted her or i can form no idea where or when she would have ended her discourse
i seized the opportunity to run away but not before i had given her five shillings and made her write down my address for i was a little frightened by what she said
i told her if she thought her lodger grew worse she was to come and let me know
weeks went by and i did not see her again
having done as much as i had i felt absolved from doing more and let ernest alone as thinking that he and i should only bore one another
he had now been ordained a little over four months but these months had not brought happiness or satisfaction with them
he had lived in a clergyman's house all his life and might have been expected perhaps to have known pretty much what being a clergyman was like and so he dida country clergyman he had formed an ideal however as regards what a town clergyman could do and was trying in a feeble tentative way to realise it but somehow or other it always managed to escape him
he lived among the poor but he did not find that he got to know them
the idea that they would come to him proved to be a mistaken one
he did indeed visit a few tame pets whom his rector desired him to look after
there was an old man and his wife who lived next door but one to ernest himself then there was a plumber of the name of chesterfield an aged lady of the name of gover blind and bedridden who munched and munched her feeble old toothless jaws as ernest spoke or read to her but who could do little more a mr brookes a rag and bottle merchant in birdsey's rents in the last stage of dropsy and perhaps half a dozen or so others
what did it all come to when he did go to see them
the plumber wanted to be flattered and liked fooling a gentleman into wasting his time by scratching his ears for him
mrs gover poor old woman wanted money she was very good and meek and when ernest got her a shilling from lady anne jones's bequest she said it was small but seasonable and munched and munched in gratitude
ernest sometimes gave her a little money himself but not as he says now half what he ought to have given
what could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her
nothing indeed but giving occasional halfcrowns to mrs gover was not regenerating the universe and ernest wanted nothing short of this
the world was all out of joint and instead of feeling it to be a cursed spite that he was born to set it right he thought he was just the kind of person that was wanted for the job and was eager to set to work only he did not exactly know how to begin for the beginning he had made with mr chesterfield and mrs gover did not promise great developments
then poor mr brookeshe suffered very much terribly indeed he was not in want of money he wanted to die and couldn't just as we sometimes want to go to sleep and cannot
he had been a seriousminded man and death frightened him as it must frighten anyone who believes that all his most secret thoughts will be shortly exposed in public
when i read ernest the description of how his father used to visit mrs thompson at battersby he coloured and saidthat's just what i used to say to mr brookes
ernest felt that his visits so far from comforting mr brookes made him fear death more and more but how could he help it
even pryer who had been curate a couple of years did not know personally more than a couple of hundred people in the parish at the outside and it was only at the houses of very few of these that he ever visited but then pryer had such a strong objection on principle to house visitations
what a drop in the sea were those with whom he and pryer were brought into direct communication in comparison with those whom he must reach and move if he were to produce much effect of any kind one way or the other
why there were between fifteen and twenty thousand poor in the parish of whom but the merest fraction ever attended a place of worship
some few went to dissenting chapels a few were roman catholics by far the greater number however were practically infidels if not actively hostile at any rate indifferent to religion while many were avowed atheistsadmirers of tom paine of whom he now heard for the first time but he never met and conversed with any of these
was he really doing everything that could be expected of him
it was all very well to say that he was doing as much as other young clergymen did that was not the kind of answer which jesus christ was likely to accept why the pharisees themselves in all probability did as much as the other pharisees did
what he should do was to go into the highways and byways and compel people to come in
was he doing this
or were not they rather compelling him to keep outoutside their doors at any rate
he began to have an uneasy feeling as though ere long unless he kept a sharp look out he should drift into being a sham
true all would be changed as soon as he could endow the college for spiritual pathology matters however had not gone too well with the things that people bought in the place that was called the stock exchange
in order to get on faster it had been arranged that ernest should buy more of these things than he could pay for with the idea that in a few weeks or even days they would be much higher in value and he could sell them at a tremendous profit but unfortunately instead of getting higher they had fallen immediately after ernest had bought and obstinately refused to get up again so after a few settlements he had got frightened for he read an article in some newspaper which said they would go ever so much lower and contrary to pryer's advice he insisted on sellingat a loss of something like  pounds
he had hardly sold when up went the shares again and he saw how foolish he had been and how wise pryer was for if pryer's advice had been followed he would have made  pounds instead of losing it
however he told himself he must live and learn
then pryer made a mistake
they had bought some shares and the shares went up delightfully for about a fortnight
this was a happy time indeed for by the end of a fortnight the lost  pounds had been recovered and three or four hundred pounds had been cleared into the bargain
all the feverish anxiety of that miserable six weeks when the  pounds was being lost was now being repaid with interest
ernest wanted to sell and make sure of the profit but pryer would not hear of it they would go ever so much higher yet and he showed ernest an article in some newspaper which proved that what he said was reasonable and they did go up a littlebut only a very little for then they went down down and ernest saw first his clear profit of three or four hundred pounds go and then the  pounds loss which he thought he had recovered slipped away by falls of a half and one at a time and then he lost  pounds more
then a newspaper said that these shares were the greatest rubbish that had ever been imposed upon the english public and ernest could stand it no longer so he sold out again this time against pryer's advice so that when they went up as they shortly did pryer scored off ernest a second time
ernest was not used to vicissitudes of this kind and they made him so anxious that his health was affected
it was arranged therefore that he had better know nothing of what was being done
pryer was a much better man of business than he was and would see to it all
this relieved ernest of a good deal of trouble and was better after all for the investments themselves for as pryer justly said a man must not have a faint heart if he hopes to succeed in buying and selling upon the stock exchange and seeing ernest nervous made pryer nervous tooat least he said it did
so the money drifted more and more into pryer's hands
as for pryer himself he had nothing but his curacy and a small allowance from his father
some of ernest's old friends got an inkling from his letters of what he was doing and did their utmost to dissuade him but he was as infatuated as a young lover of two and twenty
finding that these friends disapproved he dropped away from them and they being bored with his egotism and highflown ideas were not sorry to let him do so
of course he said nothing about his speculationsindeed he hardly knew that anything done in so good a cause could be called speculation
at battersby when his father urged him to look out for a next presentation and even brought one or two promising ones under his notice he made objections and excuses though always promising to do as his father desired very shortly
chapter lvi   by and by a subtle indefinable malaise began to take possession of him
i once saw a very young foal trying to eat some most objectionable refuse and unable to make up its mind whether it was good or no
clearly it wanted to be told
if its mother had seen what it was doing she would have set it right in a moment and as soon as ever it had been told that what it was eating was filth the foal would have recognised it and never have wanted to be told again but the foal could not settle the matter for itself or make up its mind whether it liked what it was trying to eat or no without assistance from without
i suppose it would have come to do so by and by but it was wasting time and trouble which a single look from its mother would have saved just as wort will in time ferment of itself but will ferment much more quickly if a little yeast be added to it
in the matter of knowing what gives us pleasure we are all like wort and if unaided from without can only ferment slowly and toilsomely
my unhappy hero about this time was very much like the foal or rather he felt much what the foal would have felt if its mother and all the other grownup horses in the field had vowed that what it was eating was the most excellent and nutritious food to be found anywhere
he was so anxious to do what was right and so ready to believe that every one knew better than himself that he never ventured to admit to himself that he might be all the while on a hopelessly wrong tack
it did not occur to him that there might be a blunder anywhere much less did it occur to him to try and find out where the blunder was
nevertheless he became daily more full of malaise and daily only he knew it not more ripe for an explosion should a spark fall upon him
one thing however did begin to loom out of the general vagueness and to this he instinctively turned as trying to seize iti mean the fact that he was saving very few souls whereas there were thousands and thousands being lost hourly all around him which a little energy such as mr hawke's might save
day after day went by and what was he doing
standing on professional etiquette and praying that his shares might go up and down as he wanted them so that they might give him money enough to enable him to regenerate the universe
but in the meantime the people were dying
how many souls would not be doomed to endless ages of the most frightful torments that the mind could think of before he could bring his spiritual pathology engine to bear upon them
why might he not stand and preach as he saw the dissenters doing sometimes in lincoln's inn fields and other thoroughfares
he could say all that mr hawke had said
mr hawke was a very poor creature in ernest's eyes now for he was a low churchman but we should not be above learning from any one and surely he could affect his hearers as powerfully as mr hawke had affected him if he only had the courage to set to work
the people whom he saw preaching in the squares sometimes drew large audiences
he could at any rate preach better than they
ernest broached this to pryer who treated it as something too outrageous to be even thought of
nothing he said could more tend to lower the dignity of the clergy and bring the church into contempt
his manner was brusque and even rude
ernest ventured a little mild dissent he admitted it was not usual but something at any rate must be done and that quickly
this was how wesley and whitfield had begun that great movement which had kindled religious life in the minds of hundreds of thousands
this was no time to be standing on dignity
it was just because wesley and whitfield had done what the church would not that they had won men to follow them whom the church had now lost
pryer eyed ernest searchingly and after a pause said i don't know what to make of you pontifex you are at once so very right and so very wrong
i agree with you heartily that something should be done but it must not be done in a way which experience has shown leads to nothing but fanaticism and dissent
do you approve of these wesleyans
do you hold your ordination vows so cheaply as to think that it does not matter whether the services of the church are performed in her churches and with all due ceremony or not
if you dothen frankly you had no business to be ordained if you do not then remember that one of the first duties of a young deacon is obedience to authority
neither the catholic church nor yet the church of england allows her clergy to preach in the streets of cities where there is no lack of churches
ernest felt the force of this and pryer saw that he wavered
we are living he continued more genially in an age of transition and in a country which though it has gained much by the reformation does not perceive how much it has also lost
you cannot and must not hawk christ about in the streets as though you were in a heathen country whose inhabitants had never heard of him
the people here in london have had ample warning
every church they pass is a protest to them against their lives and a call to them to repent
every churchbell they hear is a witness against them everyone of those whom they meet on sundays going to or coming from church is a warning voice from god
if these countless influences produce no effect upon them neither will the few transient words which they would hear from you
you are like dives and think that if one rose from the dead they would hear him
perhaps they might but then you cannot pretend that you have risen from the dead
though the last few words were spoken laughingly there was a subsneer about them which made ernest wince but he was quite subdued and so the conversation ended
it left ernest however not for the first time consciously dissatisfied with pryer and inclined to set his friend's opinion on one sidenot openly but quietly and without telling pryer anything about it
chapter lvii   he had hardly parted from pryer before there occurred another incident which strengthened his discontent
he had fallen as i have shown among a gang of spiritual thieves or coiners who passed the basest metal upon him without his finding it out so childish and inexperienced was he in the ways of anything but those back eddies of the world schools and universities
among the bad threepenny pieces which had been passed off upon him and which he kept for small hourly disbursement was a remark that poor people were much nicer than the richer and better educated
ernest now said that he always travelled third class not because it was cheaper but because the people whom he met in third class carriages were so much pleasanter and better behaved
as for the young men who attended ernest's evening classes they were pronounced to be more intelligent and better ordered generally than the average run of oxford and cambridge men
our foolish young friend having heard pryer talk to this effect caught up all he said and reproduced it more suo
one evening however about this time whom should he see coming along a small street not far from his own but of all persons in the world towneley looking as full of life and good spirits as ever and if possible even handsomer than he had been at cambridge
much as ernest liked him he found himself shrinking from speaking to him and was endeavouring to pass him without doing so when towneley saw him and stopped him at once being pleased to see an old cambridge face
he seemed for the moment a little confused at being seen in such a neighbourhood but recovered himself so soon that ernest hardly noticed it and then plunged into a few kindly remarks about old times
ernest felt that he quailed as he saw towneley's eye wander to his white necktie and saw that he was being reckoned up and rather disapprovingly reckoned up as a parson
it was the merest passing shade upon towneley's face but ernest had felt it
towneley said a few words of common form to ernest about his profession as being what he thought would be most likely to interest him and ernest still confused and shy gave him for lack of something better to say his little threepennybit about poor people being so very nice
towneley took this for what it was worth and nodded assent whereon ernest imprudently went further and said don't you like poor people very much yourself
towneley gave his face a comical but goodnatured screw and said quietly but slowly and decidedly no no no and escaped
it was all over with ernest from that moment
as usual he did not know it but he had entered none the less upon another reaction
towneley had just taken ernest's threepennybit into his hands looked at it and returned it to him as a bad one
why did he see in a moment that it was a bad one now though he had been unable to see it when he had taken it from pryer
of course some poor people were very nice and always would be so but as though scales had fallen suddenly from his eyes he saw that no one was nicer for being poor and that between the upper and lower classes there was a gulf which amounted practically to an impassable barrier
that evening he reflected a good deal
if towneley was right and ernest felt that the no had applied not to the remark about poor people only but to the whole scheme and scope of his own recently adopted ideas he and pryer must surely be on a wrong track
towneley had not argued with him he had said one word only and that one of the shortest in the language but ernest was in a fit state for inoculation and the minute particle of virus set about working immediately
which did he now think was most likely to have taken the juster view of life and things and whom would it be best to imitate towneley or pryer
his heart returned answer to itself without a moment's hesitation
the faces of men like towneley were open and kindly they looked as if at ease themselves and as though they would set all who had to do with them at ease as far as might be
the faces of pryer and his friends were not like this
why had he felt tacitly rebuked as soon as he had met towneley
was he not a christian
certainly he believed in the church of england as a matter of course
then how could he be himself wrong in trying to act up to the faith that he and towneley held in common
he was trying to lead a quiet unobtrusive life of selfdevotion whereas towneley was not so far as he could see trying to do anything of the kind he was only trying to get on comfortably in the world and to look and be as nice as possible
and he was nice and ernest knew that such men as himself and pryer were not nice and his old dejection came over him
then came an even worse reflection how if he had fallen among material thieves as well as spiritual ones
he knew very little of how his money was going on he had put it all now into pryer's hands and though pryer gave him cash to spend whenever he wanted it he seemed impatient of being questioned as to what was being done with the principal
it was part of the understanding he said that that was to be left to him and ernest had better stick to this or he pryer would throw up the college of spiritual pathology altogether and so ernest was cowed into acquiescence or cajoled according to the humour in which pryer saw him to be
ernest thought that further questions would look as if he doubted pryer's word and also that he had gone too far to be able to recede in decency or honour
this however he felt was riding out to meet trouble unnecessarily
pryer had been a little impatient but he was a gentleman and an admirable man of business so his money would doubtless come back to him all right some day
ernest comforted himself as regards this last source of anxiety but as regards the other he began to feel as though if he was to be saved a good samaritan must hurry up from somewherehe knew not whence
chapter lviii   next day he felt stronger again
he had been listening to the voice of the evil one on the night before and would parley no more with such thoughts
he had chosen his profession and his duty was to persevere with it
if he was unhappy it was probably because he was not giving up all for christ
let him see whether he could not do more than he was doing now and then perhaps a light would be shed upon his path
it was all very well to have made the discovery that he didn't very much like poor people but he had got to put up with them for it was among them that his work must lie
such men as towneley were very kind and considerate but he knew well enough it was only on condition that he did not preach to them
he could manage the poor better and let pryer sneer as he liked he was resolved to go more among them and try the effect of bringing christ to them if they would not come and seek christ of themselves
he would begin with his own house
who then should he take first
surely he could not do better than begin with the tailor who lived immediately over his head
this would be desirable not only because he was the one who seemed to stand most in need of conversion but also because if he were once converted he would no longer beat his wife at two o'clock in the morning and the house would be much pleasanter in consequence
he would therefore go upstairs at once and have a quiet talk with this man
before doing so he thought it would be well if he were to draw up something like a plan of a campaign he therefore reflected over some pretty conversations which would do very nicely if mr holt would be kind enough to make the answers proposed for him in their proper places
but the man was a great hulking fellow of a savage temper and ernest was forced to admit that unforeseen developments might arise to disconcert him
they say it takes nine tailors to make a man but ernest felt that it would take at least nine ernests to make a mr holt
how if as soon as ernest came in the tailor were to become violent and abusive
what could he do
mr holt was in his own lodgings and had a right to be undisturbed
a legal right yes but had he a moral right
ernest thought not considering his mode of life
but put this on one side if the man were to be violent what should he do
paul had fought with wild beasts at ephesusthat must indeed have been awfulbut perhaps they were not very wild wild beasts a rabbit and a canary are wild beasts but formidable or not as wild beasts go they would nevertheless stand no chance against st paul for he was inspired the miracle would have been if the wild beasts escaped not that st paul should have done so but however all this might be ernest felt that he dared not begin to convert mr holt by fighting him
why when he had heard mrs holt screaming murder he had cowered under the bed clothes and waited expecting to hear the blood dripping through the ceiling on to his own floor
his imagination translated every sound into a pat pat pat and once or twice he thought he had felt it dropping on to his counterpane but he had never gone upstairs to try and rescue poor mrs holt
happily it had proved next morning that mrs holt was in her usual health
ernest was in despair about hitting on any good way of opening up spiritual communication with his neighbour when it occurred to him that he had better perhaps begin by going upstairs and knocking very gently at mr holt's door
he would then resign himself to the guidance of the holy spirit and act as the occasion which i suppose was another name for the holy spirit suggested
triply armed with this reflection he mounted the stairs quite jauntily and was about to knock when he heard holt's voice inside swearing savagely at his wife
this made him pause to think whether after all the moment was an auspicious one and while he was thus pausing mr holt who had heard that someone was on the stairs opened the door and put his head out
when he saw ernest he made an unpleasant not to say offensive movement which might or might not have been directed at ernest and looked altogether so ugly that my hero had an instantaneous and unequivocal revelation from the holy spirit to the effect that he should continue his journey upstairs at once as though he had never intended arresting it at mr holt's room and begin by converting mr and mrs baxter the methodists in the top floor front
so this was what he did
these good people received him with open arms and were quite ready to talk
he was beginning to convert them from methodism to the church of england when all at once he found himself embarrassed by discovering that he did not know what he was to convert them from
he knew the church of england or thought he did but he knew nothing of methodism beyond its name
when he found that according to mr baxter the wesleyans had a vigorous system of church discipline which worked admirably in practice it appeared to him that john wesley had anticipated the spiritual engine which he and pryer were preparing and when he left the room he was aware that he had caught more of a spiritual tartar than he had expected
but he must certainly explain to pryer that the wesleyans had a system of church discipline
this was very important
mr baxter advised ernest on no account to meddle with mr holt and ernest was much relieved at the advice
if an opportunity arose of touching the man's heart he would take it he would pat the children on the head when he saw them on the stairs and ingratiate himself with them as far as he dared they were sturdy youngsters and ernest was afraid even of them for they were ready with their tongues and knew much for their ages
ernest felt that it would indeed be almost better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of the little holts
however he would try not to offend them perhaps an occasional penny or two might square them
this was as much as he could do for he saw that the attempt to be instant out of season as well as in season would st paul's injunction notwithstanding end in failure
mrs baxter gave a very bad account of miss emily snow who lodged in the second floor back next to mr holt
her story was quite different from that of mrs jupp the landlady
she would doubtless be only too glad to receive ernest's ministrations or those of any other gentleman but she was no governess she was in the ballet at drury lane and besides this she was a very bad young woman and if mrs baxter was landlady would not be allowed to stay in the house a single hour not she indeed
miss maitland in the next room to mrs baxter's own was a quiet and respectable young woman to all appearance mrs baxter had never known of any goings on in that quarter but bless you still waters run deep and these girls were all alike one as bad as the other
she was out at all kinds of hours and when you knew that you knew all
ernest did not pay much heed to these aspersions of mrs baxter's
mrs jupp had got round the greater number of his many blind sides and had warned him not to believe mrs baxter whose lip she said was something awful
ernest had heard that women were always jealous of one another and certainly these young women were more attractive than mrs baxter was so jealousy was probably at the bottom of it
if they were maligned there could be no objection to his making their acquaintance if not maligned they had all the more need of his ministrations
he would reclaim them at once
he told mrs jupp of his intention
mrs jupp at first tried to dissuade him but seeing him resolute suggested that she should herself see miss snow first so as to prepare her and prevent her from being alarmed by his visit
she was not at home now but in the course of the next day it should be arranged
in the meantime he had better try mr shaw the tinker in the front kitchen
mrs baxter had told ernest that mr shaw was from the north country and an avowed freethinker he would probably she said rather like a visit but she did not think ernest would stand much chance of making a convert of him
chapter lix   before going down into the kitchen to convert the tinker ernest ran hurriedly over his analysis of paley's evidences and put into his pocket a copy of archbishop whateley's historic doubts
then he descended the dark rotten old stairs and knocked at the tinker's door
mr shaw was very civil he said he was rather throng just now but if ernest did not mind the sound of hammering he should be very glad of a talk with him
our hero assenting to this ere long led the conversation to whateley's historic doubtsa work which as the reader may know pretends to show that there never was any such person as napoleon buonaparte and thus satirises the arguments of those who have attacked the christian miracles
mr shaw said he knew historic doubts very well
and what you think of it
said ernest who regarded the pamphlet as a masterpiece of wit and cogency
if you really want to know said mr shaw with a sly twinkle i think that he who was so willing and able to prove that what was was not would be equally able and willing to make a case for thinking that what was not was if it suited his purpose
ernest was very much taken aback
how was it that all the clever people of cambridge had never put him up to this simple rejoinder
the answer is easy they did not develop it for the same reason that a hen had never developed webbed feetthat is to say because they did not want to do so but this was before the days of evolution and ernest could not as yet know anything of the great principle that underlies it
you see continued mr shaw these writers all get their living by writing in a certain way and the more they write in that way the more they are likely to get on
you should not call them dishonest for this any more than a judge should call a barrister dishonest for earning his living by defending one in whose innocence he does not seriously believe but you should hear the barrister on the other side before you decide upon the case
this was another facer
ernest could only stammer that he had endeavoured to examine these questions as carefully as he could
you think you have said mr shaw you oxford and cambridge gentlemen think you have examined everything
i have examined very little myself except the bottoms of old kettles and saucepans but if you will answer me a few questions i will tell you whether or no you have examined much more than i have
ernest expressed his readiness to be questioned
then said the tinker give me the story of the resurrection of jesus christ as told in st john's gospel
i am sorry to say that ernest mixed up the four accounts in a deplorable manner he even made the angel come down and roll away the stone and sit upon it
he was covered with confusion when the tinker first told him without the book of some of his many inaccuracies and then verified his criticisms by referring to the new testament itself
now said mr shaw good naturedly i am an old man and you are a young one so perhaps you'll not mind my giving you a piece of advice
i like you for i believe you mean well but you've been real bad brought up and i don't think you have ever had so much as a chance yet
you know nothing of our side of the question and i have just shown you that you do not know much more of your own but i think you will make a kind of carlyle sort of a man some day
now go upstairs and read the accounts of the resurrection correctly without mixing them up and have a clear idea of what it is that each writer tells us then if you feel inclined to pay me another visit i shall be glad to see you for i shall know you have made a good beginning and mean business
till then sir i must wish you a very good morning
ernest retreated abashed
an hour sufficed him to perform the task enjoined upon him by mr shaw and at the end of that hour the no no no which still sounded in his ears as he heard it from towneley came ringing up more loudly still from the very pages of the bible itself and in respect of the most important of all the events which are recorded in it
surely ernest's first day's attempt at more promiscuous visiting and at carrying out his principles more thoroughly had not been unfruitful
but he must go and have a talk with pryer
he therefore got his lunch and went to pryer's lodgings
pryer not being at home he lounged to the british museum reading room then recently opened sent for the vestiges of creation which he had never yet seen and spent the rest of the afternoon in reading it
ernest did not see pryer on the day of his conversation with mr shaw but he did so next morning and found him in a good temper which of late he had rarely been
sometimes indeed he had behaved to ernest in a way which did not bode well for the harmony with which the college of spiritual pathology would work when it had once been founded
it almost seemed as though he were trying to get a complete moral ascendency over him so as to make him a creature of his own
he did not think it possible that he could go too far and indeed when i reflect upon my hero's folly and inexperience there is much to be said in excuse for the conclusion which pryer came to
as a matter of fact however it was not so
ernest's faith in pryer had been too great to be shaken down all in a moment but it had been weakened lately more than once
ernest had fought hard against allowing himself to see this nevertheless any third person who knew the pair would have been able to see that the connection between the two might end at any moment for when the time for one of ernest's snipelike changes of flight came he was quick in making it the time however was not yet come and the intimacy between the two was apparently all that it had ever been
it was only that horrid money business so said ernest to himself that caused any unpleasantness between them and no doubt pryer was right and he ernest much too nervous
however that might stand over for the present
in like manner though he had received a shock by reason of his conversation with mr shaw and by looking at the vestiges he was as yet too much stunned to realise the change which was coming over him
in each case the momentum of old habits carried him forward in the old direction
he therefore called on pryer and spent an hour and more with him
he did not say that he had been visiting among his neighbours this to pryer would have been like a red rag to a bull
he only talked in much his usual vein about the proposed college the lamentable want of interest in spiritual things which was characteristic of modern society and other kindred matters he concluded by saying that for the present he feared pryer was indeed right and that nothing could be done
as regards the laity said pryer nothing not until we have a discipline which we can enforce with pains and penalties
how can a sheep dog work a flock of sheep unless he can bite occasionally as well as bark
but as regards ourselves we can do much
pryer's manner was strange throughout the conversation as though he were thinking all the time of something else
his eyes wandered curiously over ernest as ernest had often noticed them wander before the words were about church discipline but somehow or other the discipline part of the story had a knack of dropping out after having been again and again emphatically declared to apply to the laity and not to the clergy once indeed pryer had pettishly exclaimed oh bother the college of spiritual pathology
as regards the clergy glimpses of a pretty large cloven hoof kept peeping out from under the saintly robe of pryer's conversation to the effect that so long as they were theoretically perfect practical peccadilloesor even peccadaccios if there is such a word were of less importance
he was restless as though wanting to approach a subject which he did not quite venture to touch upon and kept harping he did this about every third day on the wretched lack of definition concerning the limits of vice and virtue and the way in which half the vices wanted regulating rather than prohibiting
he dwelt also on the advantages of complete unreserve and hinted that there were mysteries into which ernest had not yet been initiated but which would enlighten him when he got to know them as he would be allowed to do when his friends saw that he was strong enough
pryer had often been like this before but never so nearly as it seemed to ernest coming to a pointthough what the point was he could not fully understand
his inquietude was communicating itself to ernest who would probably ere long have come to know as much as pryer could tell him but the conversation was abruptly interrupted by the appearance of a visitor
we shall never know how it would have ended for this was the very last time that ernest ever saw pryer
perhaps pryer was going to break to him some bad news about his speculations
chapter lx   ernest now went home and occupied himself till luncheon with studying dean alford's notes upon the various evangelistic records of the resurrection doing as mr shaw had told him and trying to find out not that they were all accurate but whether they were all accurate or no
he did not care which result he should arrive at but he was resolved that he would reach one or the other
when he had finished dean alford's notes he found them come to this namely that no one yet had succeeded in bringing the four accounts into tolerable harmony with each other and that the dean seeing no chance of succeeding better than his predecessors had done recommended that the whole story should be taken on trustand this ernest was not prepared to do
he got his luncheon went out for a long walk and returned to dinner at half past six
while mrs jupp was getting him his dinnera steak and a pint of stoutshe told him that miss snow would be very happy to see him in about an hour's time
this disconcerted him for his mind was too unsettled for him to wish to convert anyone just then
he reflected a little and found that in spite of the sudden shock to his opinions he was being irresistibly drawn to pay the visit as though nothing had happened
it would not look well for him not to go for he was known to be in the house
he ought not to be in too great a hurry to change his opinions on such a matter as the evidence for christ's resurrection all of a suddenbesides he need not talk to miss snow about this subject to daythere were other things he might talk about
what other things
ernest felt his heart beat fast and fiercely and an inward monitor warned him that he was thinking of anything rather than of miss snow's soul
what should he do
fly fly flyit was the only safety
but would christ have fled
even though christ had not died and risen from the dead there could be no question that he was the model whose example we were bound to follow
christ would not have fled from miss snow he was sure of that for he went about more especially with prostitutes and disreputable people
now as then it was the business of the true christian to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance
it would be inconvenient to him to change his lodgings and he could not ask mrs jupp to turn miss snow and miss maitland out of the house
where was he to draw the line
who would be just good enough to live in the same house with him and who just not good enough
besides where were these poor girls to go
was he to drive them from house to house till they had no place to lie in
it was absurd his duty was clear he would go and see miss snow at once and try if he could not induce her to change her present mode of life if he found temptation becoming too strong for him he would fly thenso he went upstairs with his bible under his arm and a consuming fire in his heart
he found miss snow looking very pretty in a neatly not to say demurely furnished room
i think she had bought an illuminated text or two and pinned it up over her fireplace that morning
ernest was very much pleased with her and mechanically placed his bible upon the table
he had just opened a timid conversation and was deep in blushes when a hurried step came bounding up the stairs as though of one over whom the force of gravity had little power and a man burst into the room saying i'm come before my time
it was towneley
his face dropped as he caught sight of ernest
what you here pontifex
well upon my word
i cannot describe the hurried explanations that passed quickly between the threeenough that in less than a minute ernest blushing more scarlet than ever slunk off bible and all deeply humiliated as he contrasted himself and towneley
before he had reached the bottom of the staircase leading to his own room he heard towneley's hearty laugh through miss snow's door and cursed the hour that he was born
then it flashed upon him that if he could not see miss snow he could at any rate see miss maitland
he knew well enough what he wanted now and as for the bible he pushed it from him to the other end of his table
it fell over on to the floor and he kicked it into a corner
it was the bible given him at his christening by his affectionate aunt elizabeth allaby
true he knew very little of miss maitland but ignorant young fools in ernest's state do not reflect or reason closely
mrs baxter had said that miss maitland and miss snow were birds of a feather and mrs baxter probably knew better than that old liar mrs jupp
shakespeare says     o opportunity thy guilt is great    'tis thou that execut'st the traitor's treason    thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get    whoever plots the sin thou 'point'st the season    'tis thou that spurn'st at right at law at reason    and in thy shady cell where none may spy him    sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
if the guilt of opportunity is great how much greater is the guilt of that which is believed to be opportunity but in reality is no opportunity at all
if the better part of valour is discretion how much more is not discretion the better part of vice  about ten minutes after we last saw ernest a scared insulted girl flushed and trembling was seen hurrying from mrs jupp's house as fast as her agitated state would let her and in another ten minutes two policemen were seen also coming out of mrs jupp's between whom there shambled rather than walked our unhappy friend ernest with staring eyes ghastly pale and with despair branded upon every line of his face
chapter lxi   pryer had done well to warn ernest against promiscuous house to house visitation
he had not gone outside mrs jupp's street door and yet what had been the result
mr holt had put him in bodily fear mr and mrs baxter had nearly made a methodist of him mr shaw had undermined his faith in the resurrection miss snow's charms had ruinedor would have done so but for an accidenthis moral character
as for miss maitland he had done his best to ruin hers and had damaged himself gravely and irretrievably in consequence
the only lodger who had done him no harm was the bellows' mender whom he had not visited
other young clergymen much greater fools in many respects than he would not have got into these scrapes
he seemed to have developed an aptitude for mischief almost from the day of his having been ordained
he could hardly preach without making some horrid faux pas
he preached one sunday morning when the bishop was at his rector's church and made his sermon turn upon the question what kind of little cake it was that the widow of zarephath had intended making when elijah found her gathering a few sticks
he demonstrated that it was a seed cake
the sermon was really very amusing and more than once he saw a smile pass over the sea of faces underneath him
the bishop was very angry and gave my hero a severe reprimand in the vestry after service was over the only excuse he could make was that he was preaching ex tempore had not thought of this particular point till he was actually in the pulpit and had then been carried away by it
another time he preached upon the barren figtree and described the hopes of the owner as he watched the delicate blossom unfold and give promise of such beautiful fruit in autumn
next day he received a letter from a botanical member of his congregation who explained to him that this could hardly have been inasmuch as the fig produces its fruit first and blossoms inside the fruit or so nearly so that no flower is perceptible to an ordinary observer
this last however was an accident which might have happened to any one but a scientist or an inspired writer
the only excuse i can make for him is that he was very youngnot yet four and twentyand that in mind as in body like most of those who in the end come to think for themselves he was a slow grower
by far the greater part moreover of his education had been an attempt not so much to keep him in blinkers as to gouge his eyes out altogether
but to return to my story
it transpired afterwards that miss maitland had had no intention of giving ernest in charge when she ran out of mrs jupp's house
she was running away because she was frightened but almost the first person whom she ran against had happened to be a policeman of a serious turn of mind who wished to gain a reputation for activity
he stopped her questioned her frightened her still more and it was he rather than miss maitland who insisted on giving my hero in charge to himself and another constable
towneley was still in mrs jupp's house when the policeman came
he had heard a disturbance and going down to ernest's room while miss maitland was out of doors had found him lying as it were stunned at the foot of the moral precipice over which he had that moment fallen
he saw the whole thing at a glance but before he could take action the policemen came in and action became impossible
he asked ernest who were his friends in london
ernest at first wanted not to say but towneley soon gave him to understand that he must do as he was bid and selected myself from the few whom he had named
writes for the stage does he
said towneley
does he write comedy
ernest thought towneley meant that i ought to write tragedy and said he was afraid i wrote burlesque
oh come come said towneley that will do famously
i will go and see him at once
but on second thoughts he determined to stay with ernest and go with him to the police court
so he sent mrs jupp for me
mrs jupp hurried so fast to fetch me that in spite of the weather's being still cold she was giving out as she expressed it in streams
the poor old wretch would have taken a cab but she had no money and did not like to ask towneley to give her some
i saw that something very serious had happened but was not prepared for anything so deplorable as what mrs jupp actually told me
as for mrs jupp she said her heart had been jumping out of its socket and back again ever since
i got her into a cab with me and we went off to the police station
she talked without ceasing
and if the neighbours do say cruel things about me i'm sure it ain't no thanks to him if they're true
mr pontifex never took a bit o' notice of me no more than if i had been his sister
oh it's enough to make anyone's back bone curdle
then i thought perhaps my rose might get on better with him so i set her to dust him and clean him as though i were busy and gave her such a beautiful clean new pinny but he never took no notice of her no more than he did of me and she didn't want no compliment neither she wouldn't have taken not a shilling from him though he had offered it but he didn't seem to know anything at all
i can't make out what the young men are acoming to i wish the horn may blow for me and the worms take me this very night if it's not enough to make a woman stand before god and strike the one half on 'em silly to see the way they goes on and many an honest girl has to go home night after night without so much as a fourpenny bit and paying three and sixpence a week rent and not a shelf nor cupboard in the place and a dead wall in front of the window
it's not mr pontifex she continued that's so bad he's good at heart
he never says nothing unkind
and then there's his dear eyesbut when i speak about that to my rose she calls me an old fool and says i ought to be poleaxed
it's that pryer as i can't abide
oh he
he likes to wound a woman's feelings he do and to chuck anything in her face he dohe likes to wind a woman up and to wound her down
mrs jupp pronounced wound as though it rhymed to sound
it's a gentleman's place to soothe a woman but he he'd like to tear her hair out by handfuls
why he told me to my face that i was agetting old old indeed
there's not a woman in london knows my age except mrs davis down in the old kent road and beyond a haricot vein in one of my legs i'm as young as ever i was
old indeed
there's many a good tune played on an old fiddle
i hate his nasty insinuendos
even if i had wanted to stop her i could not have done so
she said a great deal more than i have given above
i have left out much because i could not remember it but still more because it was really impossible for me to print it
when we got to the police station i found towneley and ernest already there
the charge was one of assault but not aggravated by serious violence
even so however it was lamentable enough and we both saw that our young friend would have to pay dearly for his inexperience
we tried to bail him out for the night but the inspector would not accept bail so we were forced to leave him
towneley then went back to mrs jupp's to see if he could find miss maitland and arrange matters with her
she was not there but he traced her to the house of her father who lived at camberwell
the father was furious and would not hear of any intercession on towneley's part
he was a dissenter and glad to make the most of any scandal against a clergyman towneley therefore was obliged to return unsuccessful
next morning towneleywho regarded ernest as a drowning man who must be picked out of the water somehow or other if possible irrespective of the way in which he got into itcalled on me and we put the matter into the hands of one of the best known attorneys of the day
i was greatly pleased with towneley and thought it due to him to tell him what i had told no one else
i mean that ernest would come into his aunt's money in a few years' time and would therefore then be rich
towneley was doing all he could before this but i knew that the knowledge i had imparted to him would make him feel as though ernest was more one of his own class and had therefore a greater claim upon his good offices
as for ernest himself his gratitude was greater than could be expressed in words
i have heard him say that he can call to mind many moments each one of which might well pass for the happiest of his life but that this night stands clearly out as the most painful that he ever passed yet so kind and considerate was towneley that it was quite bearable
but with all the best wishes in the world neither towneley nor i could do much to help beyond giving our moral support
our attorney told us that the magistrate before whom ernest would appear was very severe on cases of this description and that the fact of his being a clergyman would tell against him
ask for no remand he said and make no defence
we will call mr pontifex's rector and you two gentlemen as witnesses for previous good character
these will be enough
let us then make a profound apology and beg the magistrate to deal with the case summarily instead of sending it for trial
if you can get this believe me your young friend will be better out of it than he has any right to expect
chapter lxii   this advice besides being obviously sensible would end in saving ernest both time and suspense of mind so we had no hesitation in adopting it
the case was called on about eleven o'clock but we got it adjourned till three so as to give time for ernest to set his affairs as straight as he could and to execute a power of attorney enabling me to act for him as i should think fit while he was in prison
then all came out about pryer and the college of spiritual pathology
ernest had even greater difficulty in making a clean breast of this than he had had in telling us about miss maitland but he told us all and the upshot was that he had actually handed over to pryer every halfpenny that he then possessed with no other security than pryer's iou
's for the amount
ernest though still declining to believe that pryer could be guilty of dishonourable conduct was becoming alive to the folly of what he had been doing he still made sure however of recovering at any rate the greater part of his property as soon as pryer should have had time to sell
towneley and i were of a different opinion but we did not say what we thought
it was dreary work waiting all the morning amid such unfamiliar and depressing surroundings
i thought how the psalmist had exclaimed with quiet irony one day in thy courts is better than a thousand and i thought that i could utter a very similar sentiment in respect of the courts in which towneley and i were compelled to loiter
at last about three o'clock the case was called on and we went round to the part of the court which is reserved for the general public while ernest was taken into the prisoner's dock
as soon as he had collected himself sufficiently he recognised the magistrate as the old gentleman who had spoken to him in the train on the day he was leaving school and saw or thought he saw to his great grief that he too was recognised
mr ottery for this was our attorney's name took the line he had proposed
he called no other witnesses than the rector towneley and myself and threw himself on the mercy of the magistrate
when he had concluded the magistrate spoke as follows ernest pontifex yours is one of the most painful cases that i have ever had to deal with
you have been singularly favoured in your parentage and education
you have had before you the example of blameless parents who doubtless instilled into you from childhood the enormity of the offence which by your own confession you have committed
you were sent to one of the best public schools in england
it is not likely that in the healthy atmosphere of such a school as roughborough you can have come across contaminating influences you were probably i may say certainly impressed at school with the heinousness of any attempt to depart from the strictest chastity until such time as you had entered into a state of matrimony
at cambridge you were shielded from impurity by every obstacle which virtuous and vigilant authorities could devise and even had the obstacles been fewer your parents probably took care that your means should not admit of your throwing money away upon abandoned characters
at night proctors patrolled the street and dogged your steps if you tried to go into any haunt where the presence of vice was suspected
by day the females who were admitted within the college walls were selected mainly on the score of age and ugliness
it is hard to see what more can be done for any young man than this
for the last four or five months you have been a clergyman and if a single impure thought had still remained within your mind ordination should have removed it nevertheless not only does it appear that your mind is as impure as though none of the influences to which i have referred had been brought to bear upon it but it seems as though their only result had been thisthat you have not even the common sense to be able to distinguish between a respectable girl and a prostitute
if i were to take a strict view of my duty i should commit you for trial but in consideration of this being your first offence i shall deal leniently with you and sentence you to imprisonment with hard labour for six calendar months
towneley and i both thought there was a touch of irony in the magistrate's speech and that he could have given a lighter sentence if he would but that was neither here nor there
we obtained leave to see ernest for a few minutes before he was removed to coldbath fields where he was to serve his term and found him so thankful to have been summarily dealt with that he hardly seemed to care about the miserable plight in which he was to pass the next six months
when he came out he said he would take what remained of his money go off to america or australia and never be heard of more
we left him full of this resolve i to write to theobald and also to instruct my solicitor to get ernest's money out of pryer's hands and towneley to see the reporters and keep the case out of the newspapers
he was successful as regards all the higherclass papers
there was only one journal and that of the lowest class which was incorruptible
chapter lxiii   i saw my solicitor at once but when i tried to write to theobald i found it better to say i would run down and see him
i therefore proposed this asking him to meet me at the station and hinting that i must bring bad news about his son
i knew he would not get my letter more than a couple of hours before i should see him and thought the short interval of suspense might break the shock of what i had to say
never do i remember to have halted more between two opinions than on my journey to battersby upon this unhappy errand
when i thought of the little sallowfaced lad whom i had remembered years before of the long and savage cruelty with which he had been treated in childhoodcruelty none the less real for having been due to ignorance and stupidity rather than to deliberate malice of the atmosphere of lying and selflaudatory hallucination in which he had been brought up of the readiness the boy had shown to love anything that would be good enough to let him and of how affection for his parents unless i am much mistaken had only died in him because it had been killed anew again and again and again each time that it had tried to spring
when i thought of all this i felt as though if the matter had rested with me i would have sentenced theobald and christina to mental suffering even more severe than that which was about to fall upon them
but on the other hand when i thought of theobald's own childhood of that dreadful old george pontifex his father of john and mrs john and of his two sisters when again i thought of christina's long years of hope deferred that maketh the heart sick before she was married of the life she must have led at crampsford and of the surroundings in the midst of which she and her husband both lived at battersby i felt as though the wonder was that misfortunes so persistent had not been followed by even graver retribution
poor people
they had tried to keep their ignorance of the world from themselves by calling it the pursuit of heavenly things and then shutting their eyes to anything that might give them trouble
a son having been born to them they had shut his eyes also as far as was practicable
who could blame them
they had chapter and verse for everything they had either done or left undone there is no better thumbed precedent than that for being a clergyman and a clergyman's wife
in what respect had they differed from their neighbours
how did their household differ from that of any other clergyman of the better sort from one end of england to the other
why then should it have been upon them of all people in the world that this tower of siloam had fallen
surely it was the tower of siloam that was naught rather than those who stood under it it was the system rather than the people that was at fault
if theobald and his wife had but known more of the world and of the things that are therein they would have done little harm to anyone
selfish they would have always been but not more so than may very well be pardoned and not more than other people would be
as it was the case was hopeless it would be no use their even entering into their mothers' wombs and being born again
they must not only be born again but they must be born again each one of them of a new father and of a new mother and of a different line of ancestry for many generations before their minds could become supple enough to learn anew
the only thing to do with them was to humour them and make the best of them till they diedand be thankful when they did so
theobald got my letter as i had expected and met me at the station nearest to battersby
as i walked back with him towards his own house i broke the news to him as gently as i could
i pretended that the whole thing was in great measure a mistake and that though ernest no doubt had had intentions which he ought to have resisted he had not meant going anything like the length which miss maitland supposed
i said we had felt how much appearances were against him and had not dared to set up this defence before the magistrate though we had no doubt about its being the true one
theobald acted with a readier and acuter moral sense than i had given him credit for
i will have nothing more to do with him he exclaimed promptly i will never see his face again do not let him write either to me or to his mother we know of no such person
tell him you have seen me and that from this day forward i shall put him out of my mind as though he had never been born
i have been a good father to him and his mother idolised him selfishness and ingratitude have been the only return we have ever had from him my hope henceforth must be in my remaining children
i told him how ernest's fellow curate had got hold of his money and hinted that he might very likely be penniless or nearly so on leaving prison
theobald did not seem displeased at this but added soon afterwards if this proves to be the case tell him from me that i will give him a hundred pounds if he will tell me through you when he will have it paid but tell him not to write and thank me and say that if he attempts to open up direct communication either with his mother or myself he shall not have a penny of the money
knowing what i knew and having determined on violating miss pontifex's instructions should the occasion arise i did not think ernest would be any the worse for a complete estrangement from his family so i acquiesced more readily in what theobald had proposed than that gentleman may have expected
thinking it better that i should not see christina i left theobald near battersby and walked back to the station
on my way i was pleased to reflect that ernest's father was less of a fool than i had taken him to be and had the greater hopes therefore that his son's blunders might be due to postnatal rather than congenital misfortunes
accidents which happen to a man before he is born in the persons of his ancestors will if he remembers them at all leave an indelible impression on him they will have moulded his character so that do what he will it is hardly possible for him to escape their consequences
if a man is to enter into the kingdom of heaven he must do so not only as a little child but as a little embryo or rather as a little zoospermand not only this but as one that has come of zoosperms which have entered into the kingdom of heaven before him for many generations
accidents which occur for the first time and belong to the period since a man's last birth are not as a general rule so permanent in their effects though of course they may sometimes be so
at any rate i was not displeased at the view which ernest's father took of the situation
chapter lxiv   after ernest had been sentenced he was taken back to the cells to wait for the van which should take him to coldbath fields where he was to serve his term
he was still too stunned and dazed by the suddenness with which events had happened during the last twentyfour hours to be able to realise his position
a great chasm had opened between his past and future nevertheless he breathed his pulse beat he could think and speak
it seemed to him that he ought to be prostrated by the blow that had fallen on him but he was not prostrated he had suffered from many smaller laches far more acutely
it was not until he thought of the pain his disgrace would inflict on his father and mother that he felt how readily he would have given up all he had rather than have fallen into his present plight
it would break his mother's heart
it must he knew it wouldand it was he who had done this
he had had a headache coming on all the forenoon but as he thought of his father and mother his pulse quickened and the pain in his head suddenly became intense
he could hardly walk to the van and he found its motion insupportable
on reaching the prison he was too ill to walk without assistance across the hall to the corridor or gallery where prisoners are marshalled on their arrival
the prison warder seeing at once that he was a clergyman did not suppose he was shamming as he might have done in the case of an old gaolbird he therefore sent for the doctor
when this gentleman arrived ernest was declared to be suffering from an incipient attack of brain fever and was taken away to the infirmary
here he hovered for the next two months between life and death never in full possession of his reason and often delirious but at last contrary to the expectation of both doctor and nurse he began slowly to recover
it is said that those who have been nearly drowned find the return to consciousness much more painful than the loss of it had been and so it was with my hero
as he lay helpless and feeble it seemed to him a refinement of cruelty that he had not died once for all during his delirium
he thought he should still most likely recover only to sink a little later on from shame and sorrow nevertheless from day to day he mended though so slowly that he could hardly realise it to himself
one afternoon however about three weeks after he had regained consciousness the nurse who tended him and who had been very kind to him made some little rallying sally which amused him he laughed and as he did so she clapped her hands and told him he would be a man again
the spark of hope was kindled and again he wished to live
almost from that moment his thoughts began to turn less to the horrors of the past and more to the best way of meeting the future
his worst pain was on behalf of his father and mother and how he should again face them
it still seemed to him that the best thing both for him and them would be that he should sever himself from them completely take whatever money he could recover from pryer and go to some place in the uttermost parts of the earth where he should never meet anyone who had known him at school or college and start afresh
or perhaps he might go to the gold fields in california or australia of which such wonderful accounts were then heard there he might even make his fortune and return as an old man many years hence unknown to everyone and if so he would live at cambridge
as he built these castles in the air the spark of life became a flame and he longed for health and for the freedom which now that so much of his sentence had expired was not after all very far distant
then things began to shape themselves more definitely
whatever happened he would be a clergyman no longer
it would have been practically impossible for him to have found another curacy even if he had been so minded but he was not so minded
he hated the life he had been leading ever since he had begun to read for orders he could not argue about it but simply he loathed it and would have no more of it
as he dwelt on the prospect of becoming a layman again however disgraced he rejoiced at what had befallen him and found a blessing in this very imprisonment which had at first seemed such an unspeakable misfortune
perhaps the shock of so great a change in his surroundings had accelerated changes in his opinions just as the cocoons of silkworms when sent in baskets by rail hatch before their time through the novelty of heat and jolting
but however this may be his belief in the stories concerning the death resurrection and ascension of jesus christ and hence his faith in all the other christian miracles had dropped off him once and for ever
the investigation he had made in consequence of mr shaw's rebuke hurried though it was had left a deep impression upon him and now he was well enough to read he made the new testament his chief study going through it in the spirit which mr shaw had desired of him that is to say as one who wished neither to believe nor disbelieve but cared only about finding out whether he ought to believe or no
the more he read in this spirit the more the balance seemed to lie in favour of unbelief till in the end all further doubt became impossible and he saw plainly enough that whatever else might be true the story that christ had died come to life again and been carried from earth through clouds into the heavens could not now be accepted by unbiassed people
it was well he had found it out so soon
in one way or another it was sure to meet him sooner or later
he would probably have seen it years ago if he had not been hoodwinked by people who were paid for hoodwinking him
what should he have done he asked himself if he had not made his present discovery till years later when he was more deeply committed to the life of a clergyman
should he have had the courage to face it or would he not more probably have evolved some excellent reason for continuing to think as he had thought hitherto
should he have had the courage to break away even from his present curacy
he thought not and knew not whether to be more thankful for having been shown his error or for having been caught up and twisted round so that he could hardly err farther almost at the very moment of his having discovered it
the price he had had to pay for this boon was light as compared with the boon itself
what is too heavy a price to pay for having duty made at once clear and easy of fulfilment instead of very difficult
he was sorry for his father and mother and he was sorry for miss maitland but he was no longer sorry for himself
it puzzled him however that he should not have known how much he had hated being a clergyman till now
he knew that he did not particularly like it but if anyone had asked him whether he actually hated it he would have answered no
i suppose people almost always want something external to themselves to reveal to them their own likes and dislikes
our most assured likings have for the most part been arrived at neither by introspection nor by any process of conscious reasoning but by the bounding forth of the heart to welcome the gospel proclaimed to it by another
we hear some say that such and such a thing is thus or thus and in a moment the train that has been laid within us but whose presence we knew not flashes into consciousness and perception
only a year ago he had bounded forth to welcome mr hawke's sermon since then he had bounded after a college of spiritual pathology now he was in full cry after rationalism pure and simple how could he be sure that his present state of mind would be more lasting than his previous ones
he could not be certain but he felt as though he were now on firmer ground than he had ever been before and no matter how fleeting his present opinions might prove to be he could not but act according to them till he saw reason to change them
how impossible he reflected it would have been for him to do this if he had remained surrounded by people like his father and mother or pryer and pryer's friends and his rector
he had been observing reflecting and assimilating all these months with no more consciousness of mental growth than a schoolboy has of growth of body but should he have been able to admit his growth to himself and to act up to his increased strength if he had remained in constant close connection with people who assured him solemnly that he was under a hallucination
the combination against him was greater than his unaided strength could have broken through and he felt doubtful how far any shock less severe than the one from which he was suffering would have sufficed to free him
chapter lxv   as he lay on his bed day after day slowly recovering he woke up to the fact which most men arrive at sooner or later i mean that very few care two straws about truth or have any confidence that it is righter and better to believe what is true than what is untrue even though belief in the untruth may seem at first sight most expedient
yet it is only these few who can be said to believe anything at all the rest are simply unbelievers in disguise
perhaps after all these last are right
they have numbers and prosperity on their side
they have all which the rationalist appeals to as his tests of right and wrong
right according to him is what seems right to the majority of sensible welltodo people we know of no safer criterion than this but what does the decision thus arrived at involve
simply this that a conspiracy of silence about things whose truth would be immediately apparent to disinterested enquirers is not only tolerable but righteous on the part of those who profess to be and take money for being par excellence guardians and teachers of truth
ernest saw no logical escape from this conclusion
he saw that belief on the part of the early christians in the miraculous nature of christ's resurrection was explicable without any supposition of miracle
the explanation lay under the eyes of anyone who chose to take a moderate degree of trouble it had been put before the world again and again and there had been no serious attempt to refute it
how was it that dean alford for example who had made the new testament his speciality could not or would not see what was so obvious to ernest himself
could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth
yes but was he not also a respectable and successful man and were not the vast majority of respectable and successful men such for example as all the bishops and archbishops doing exactly as dean alford did and did not this make their action right no matter though it had been cannibalism or infanticide or even habitual untruthfulness of mind
monstrous odious falsehood
ernest's feeble pulse quickened and his pale face flushed as this hateful view of life presented itself to him in all its logical consistency
it was not the fact of most men being liars that shocked himthat was all right enough but even the momentary doubt whether the few who were not liars ought not to become liars too
there was no hope left if this were so if this were so let him die the sooner the better
lord he exclaimed inwardly i don't believe one word of it
strengthen thou and confirm my disbelief
it seemed to him that he could never henceforth see a bishop going to consecration without saying to himself there but for the grace of god went ernest pontifex
it was no doing of his
he could not boast if he had lived in the time of christ he might himself have been an early christian or even an apostle for aught he knew
on the whole he felt that he had much to be thankful for
the conclusion then that it might be better to believe error than truth should be ordered out of court at once no matter by how clear a logic it had been arrived at but what was the alternative
it was this that our criterion of truthie
that truth is what commends itself to the great majority of sensible and successful peopleis not infallible
the rule is sound and covers by far the greater number of cases but it has its exceptions
he asked himself what were they
ah
that was a difficult matter there were so many and the rules which governed them were sometimes so subtle that mistakes always had and always would be made it was just this that made it impossible to reduce life to an exact science
there was a rough and ready ruleofthumb test of truth and a number of rules as regards exceptions which could be mastered without much trouble yet there was a residue of cases in which decision was difficultso difficult that a man had better follow his instinct than attempt to decide them by any process of reasoning
instinct then is the ultimate court of appeal
and what is instinct
it is a mode of faith in the evidence of things not actually seen
and so my hero returned almost to the point from which he had started originally namely that the just shall live by faith
and this is what the justthat is to say reasonable peopledo as regards those daily affairs of life which most concern them
they settle smaller matters by the exercise of their own deliberation
more important ones such as the cure of their own bodies and the bodies of those whom they love the investment of their money the extrication of their affairs from any serious messthese things they generally entrust to others of whose capacity they know little save from general report they act therefore on the strength of faith not of knowledge
so the english nation entrusts the welfare of its fleet and naval defences to a first lord of the admiralty who not being a sailor can know nothing about these matters except by acts of faith
there can be no doubt about faith and not reason being the ultima ratio
even euclid who has laid himself as little open to the charge of credulity as any writer who ever lived cannot get beyond this
he has no demonstrable first premise
he requires postulates and axioms which transcend demonstration and without which he can do nothing
his superstructure indeed is demonstration but his ground is faith
nor again can he get further than telling a man he is a fool if he persists in differing from him
he says which is absurd and declines to discuss the matter further
faith and authority therefore prove to be as necessary for him as for anyone else
by faith in what then asked ernest of himself shall a just man endeavour to live at this present time
he answered to himself at any rate not by faith in the supernatural element of the christian religion
and how should he best persuade his fellowcountrymen to leave off believing in this supernatural element
looking at the matter from a practical point of view he thought the archbishop of canterbury afforded the most promising key to the situation
it lay between him and the pope
the pope was perhaps best in theory but in practice the archbishop of canterbury would do sufficiently well
if he could only manage to sprinkle a pinch of salt as it were on the archbishop's tail he might convert the whole church of england to free thought by a coup de main
there must be an amount of cogency which even an archbishopan archbishop whose perceptions had never been quickened by imprisonment for assaultwould not be able to withstand
when brought face to face with the facts as he ernest could arrange them his grace would have no resource but to admit them being an honourable man he would at once resign his archbishopric and christianity would become extinct in england within a few months' time
this at any rate was how things ought to be
but all the time ernest had no confidence in the archbishop's not hopping off just as the pinch was about to fall on him and this seemed so unfair that his blood boiled at the thought of it
if this was to be so he must try if he could not fix him by the judicious use of birdlime or a snare or throw the salt on his tail from an ambuscade
to do him justice it was not himself that he greatly cared about
he knew he had been humbugged and he knew also that the greater part of the ills which had afflicted him were due indirectly in chief measure to the influence of christian teaching still if the mischief had ended with himself he should have thought little about it but there was his sister and his brother joey and the hundreds and thousands of young people throughout england whose lives were being blighted through the lies told them by people whose business it was to know better but who scamped their work and shirked difficulties instead of facing them
it was this which made him think it worth while to be angry and to consider whether he could not at least do something towards saving others from such years of waste and misery as he had had to pass himself
if there was no truth in the miraculous accounts of christ's death and resurrection the whole of the religion founded upon the historic truth of those events tumbled to the ground
my he exclaimed with all the arrogance of youth they put a gipsy or fortuneteller into prison for getting money out of silly people who think they have supernatural power why should they not put a clergyman in prison for pretending that he can absolve sins or turn bread and wine into the flesh and blood of one who died two thousand years ago
what he asked himself could be more pure 'hankypanky' than that a bishop should lay his hands upon a young man and pretend to convey to him the spiritual power to work this miracle
it was all very well to talk about toleration toleration like everything else had its limits besides if it was to include the bishop let it include the fortuneteller too
he would explain all this to the archbishop of canterbury by and by but as he could not get hold of him just now it occurred to him that he might experimentalise advantageously upon the viler soul of the prison chaplain
it was only those who took the first and most obvious step in their power who ever did great things in the end so one day when mr hughesfor this was the chaplain's namewas talking with him ernest introduced the question of christian evidences and tried to raise a discussion upon them
mr hughes had been very kind to him but he was more than twice my hero's age and had long taken the measure of such objections as ernest tried to put before him
i do not suppose he believed in the actual objective truth of the stories about christ's resurrection and ascension any more than ernest did but he knew that this was a small matter and that the real issue lay much deeper than this
mr hughes was a man who had been in authority for many years and he brushed ernest on one side as if he had been a fly
he did it so well that my hero never ventured to tackle him again and confined his conversation with him for the future to such matters as what he had better do when he got out of prison and here mr hughes was ever ready to listen to him with sympathy and kindness
chapter lxvi   ernest was now so far convalescent as to be able to sit up for the greater part of the day
he had been three months in prison and though not strong enough to leave the infirmary was beyond all fear of a relapse
he was talking one day with mr hughes about his future and again expressed his intention of emigrating to australia or new zealand with the money he should recover from pryer
whenever he spoke of this he noticed that mr hughes looked grave and was silent he had thought that perhaps the chaplain wanted him to return to his profession and disapproved of his evident anxiety to turn to something else now however he asked mr hughes point blank why it was that he disapproved of his idea of emigrating
mr hughes endeavoured to evade him but ernest was not to be put off
there was something in the chaplain's manner which suggested that he knew more than ernest did but did not like to say it
this alarmed him so much that he begged him not to keep him in suspense after a little hesitation mr hughes thinking him now strong enough to stand it broke the news as gently as he could that the whole of ernest's money had disappeared
the day after my return from battersby i called on my solicitor and was told that he had written to pryer requiring him to refund the monies for which he had given his iou's
pryer replied that he had given orders to his broker to close his operations which unfortunately had resulted so far in heavy loss and that the balance should be paid to my solicitor on the following settling day then about a week distant
when the time came we heard nothing from pryer and going to his lodgings found that he had left with his few effects on the very day after he had heard from us and had not been seen since
i had heard from ernest the name of the broker who had been employed and went at once to see him
he told me pryer had closed all his accounts for cash on the day that ernest had been sentenced and had received  pounds which was all that remained of ernest's original  pounds
with this he had decamped nor had we enough clue as to his whereabouts to be able to take any steps to recover the money
there was in fact nothing to be done but to consider the whole as lost
i may say here that neither i nor ernest ever heard of pryer again nor have any idea what became of him
this placed me in a difficult position
i knew of course that in a few years ernest would have many times over as much money as he had lost but i knew also that he did not know this and feared that the supposed loss of all he had in the world might be more than he could stand when coupled with his other misfortunes
the prison authorities had found theobald's address from a letter in ernest's pocket and had communicated with him more than once concerning his son's illness but theobald had not written to me and i supposed my godson to be in good health
he would be just twentyfour years old when he left prison and if i followed out his aunt's instructions would have to battle with fortune for another four years as well as he could
the question before me was whether it was right to let him run so much risk or whether i should not to some extent transgress my instructionswhich there was nothing to prevent my doing if i thought miss pontifex would have wished itand let him have the same sum that he would have recovered from pryer
if my godson had been an older man and more fixed in any definite groove this is what i should have done but he was still very young and more than commonly unformed for his age
if again i had known of his illness i should not have dared to lay any heavier burden on his back than he had to bear already but not being uneasy about his health i thought a few years of roughing it and of experience concerning the importance of not playing tricks with money would do him no harm
so i decided to keep a sharp eye upon him as soon as he came out of prison and to let him splash about in deep water as best he could till i saw whether he was able to swim or was about to sink
in the first case i would let him go on swimming till he was nearly eightandtwenty when i would prepare him gradually for the good fortune that awaited him in the second i would hurry up to the rescue
so i wrote to say that pryer had absconded and that he could have  pounds from his father when he came out of prison
i then waited to see what effect these tidings would have not expecting to receive an answer for three months for i had been told on enquiry that no letter could be received by a prisoner till after he had been three months in gaol
i also wrote to theobald and told him of pryer's disappearance
as a matter of fact when my letter arrived the governor of the gaol read it and in a case of such importance would have relaxed the rules if ernest's state had allowed it his illness prevented this and the governor left it to the chaplain and the doctor to break the news to him when they thought him strong enough to bear it which was now the case
in the meantime i received a formal official document saying that my letter had been received and would be communicated to the prisoner in due course i believe it was simply through a mistake on the part of a clerk that i was not informed of ernest's illness but i heard nothing of it till i saw him by his own desire a few days after the chaplin had broken to him the substance of what i had written
ernest was terribly shocked when he heard of the loss of his money but his ignorance of the world prevented him from seeing the full extent of the mischief
he had never been in serious want of money yet and did not know what it meant
in reality money losses are the hardest to bear of any by those who are old enough to comprehend them
a man can stand being told that he must submit to a severe surgical operation or that he has some disease which will shortly kill him or that he will be a cripple or blind for the rest of his life dreadful as such tidings must be we do not find that they unnerve the greater number of mankind most men indeed go coolly enough even to be hanged but the strongest quail before financial ruin and the better men they are the more complete as a general rule is their prostration
suicide is a common consequence of money losses it is rarely sought as a means of escape from bodily suffering
if we feel that we have a competence at our backs so that we can die warm and quietly in our beds with no need to worry about expense we live our lives out to the dregs no matter how excruciating our torments
job probably felt the loss of his flocks and herds more than that of his wife and family for he could enjoy his flocks and herds without his family but not his familynot for longif he had lost all his money
loss of money indeed is not only the worst pain in itself but it is the parent of all others
let a man have been brought up to a moderate competence and have no specially then let his money be suddenly taken from him and how long is his health likely to survive the change in all his little ways which loss of money will entail
how long again is the esteem and sympathy of friends likely to survive ruin
people may be very sorry for us but their attitude towards us hitherto has been based upon the supposition that we were situated thus or thus in money matters when this breaks down there must be a restatement of the social problem so far as we are concerned we have been obtaining esteem under false pretences
granted then that the three most serious losses which a man can suffer are those affecting money health and reputation
loss of money is far the worst then comes illhealth and then loss of reputation loss of reputation is a bad third for if a man keeps health and money unimpaired it will be generally found that his loss of reputation is due to breaches of parvenu conventions only and not to violations of those older better established canons whose authority is unquestionable
in this case a man may grow a new reputation as easily as a lobster grows a new claw or if he have health and money may thrive in great peace of mind without any reputation at all
the only chance for a man who has lost his money is that he shall still be young enough to stand uprooting and transplanting without more than temporary derangement and this i believed my godson still to be
by the prison rules he might receive and send a letter after he had been in gaol three months and might also receive one visit from a friend
when he received my letter he at once asked me to come and see him which of course i did
i found him very much changed and still so feeble that the exertion of coming from the infirmary to the cell in which i was allowed to see him and the agitation of seeing me were too much for him
at first he quite broke down and i was so pained at the state in which i found him that i was on the point of breaking my instructions then and there
i contented myself however for the time with assuring him that i would help him as soon as he came out of prison and that when he had made up his mind what he would do he was to come to me for what money might be necessary if he could not get it from his father
to make it easier for him i told him that his aunt on her death bed had desired me to do something of this sort should an emergency arise so that he would only be taking what his aunt had left him
then said he i will not take the  pounds from my father and i will never see him or my mother again
i said take the  pounds ernest and as much more as you can get and then do not see them again if you do not like
this ernest would not do
if he took money from them he could not cut them and he wanted to cut them
i thought my godson would get on a great deal better if he would only have the firmness to do as he proposed as regards breaking completely with his father and mother and said so
then don't you like them
said he with a look of surprise
like them
said i i think they're horrid
oh that's the kindest thing of all you have done for me he exclaimed i thought allall middleaged people liked my father and mother
he had been about to call me old but i was only fiftyseven and was not going to have this so i made a face when i saw him hesitating which drove him into middleaged
if you like it said i i will say all your family are horrid except yourself and your aunt alethea
the greater part of every family is always odious if there are one or two good ones in a very large family it is as much as can be expected
thank you he replied gratefully i think i can now stand almost anything
i will come and see you as soon as i come out of gaol
good bye
for the warder had told us that the time allowed for our interview was at an end
chapter lxvii   as soon as ernest found that he had no money to look to upon leaving prison he saw that his dreams about emigrating and farming must come to an end for he knew that he was incapable of working at the plough or with the axe for long together himself
and now it seemed he should have no money to pay any one else for doing so
it was this that resolved him to part once and for all with his parents
if he had been going abroad he could have kept up relations with them for they would have been too far off to interfere with him
he knew his father and mother would object to being cut they would wish to appear kind and forgiving they would also dislike having no further power to plague him but he knew also very well that so long as he and they ran in harness together they would be always pulling one way and he another
he wanted to drop the gentleman and go down into the ranks beginning on the lowest rung of the ladder where no one would know of his disgrace or mind it if he did know his father and mother on the other hand would wish him to clutch on to the fagend of gentility at a starvation salary and with no prospect of advancement
ernest had seen enough in ashpit place to know that a tailor if he did not drink and attended to his business could earn more money than a clerk or a curate while much less expense by way of show was required of him
the tailor also had more liberty and a better chance of rising
ernest resolved at once as he had fallen so far to fall still lowerpromptly gracefully and with the idea of rising again rather than cling to the skirts of a respectability which would permit him to exist on sufferance only and make him pay an utterly extortionate price for an article which he could do better without
he arrived at this result more quickly than he might otherwise have done through remembering something he had once heard his aunt say about kissing the soil
this had impressed him and stuck by him perhaps by reason of its brevity when later on he came to know the story of hercules and antaeus he found it one of the very few ancient fables which had a hold over himhis chiefest debt to classical literature
his aunt had wanted him to learn carpentering as a means of kissing the soil should his hercules ever throw him
it was too late for this nowor he thought it wasbut the mode of carrying out his aunt's idea was a detail there were a hundred ways of kissing the soil besides becoming a carpenter
he had told me this during our interview and i had encouraged him to the utmost of my power
he showed so much more good sense than i had given him credit for that i became comparatively easy about him and determined to let him play his own game being always however ready to hand in case things went too far wrong
it was not simply because he disliked his father and mother that he wanted to have no more to do with them if it had been only this he would have put up with them but a warning voice within told him distinctly enough that if he was clean cut away from them he might still have a chance of success whereas if they had anything whatever to do with him or even knew where he was they would hamper him and in the end ruin him
absolute independence he believed to be his only chance of very life itself
over and above thisif this were not enoughernest had a faith in his own destiny such as most young men i suppose feel but the grounds of which were not apparent to any one but himself
rightly or wrongly in a quiet way he believed he possessed a strength which if he were only free to use it in his own way might do great things some day
he did not know when nor where nor how his opportunity was to come but he never doubted that it would come in spite of all that had happened and above all else he cherished the hope that he might know how to seize it if it came for whatever it was it would be something that no one else could do so well as he could
people said there were no dragons and giants for adventurous men to fight with nowadays it was beginning to dawn upon him that there were just as many now as at any past time
monstrous as such a faith may seem in one who was qualifying himself for a high mission by a term of imprisonment he could no more help it than he could help breathing it was innate in him and it was even more with a view to this than for other reasons that he wished to sever the connection between himself and his parents for he knew that if ever the day came in which it should appear that before him too there was a race set in which it might be an honour to have run among the foremost his father and mother would be the first to let him and hinder him in running it
they had been the first to say that he ought to run such a race they would also be the first to trip him up if he took them at their word and then afterwards upbraid him for not having won
achievement of any kind would be impossible for him unless he was free from those who would be for ever dragging him back into the conventional
the conventional had been tried already and had been found wanting
he had an opportunity now if he chose to take it of escaping once for all from those who at once tormented him and would hold him earthward should a chance of soaring open before him
he should never have had it but for his imprisonment but for this the force of habit and routine would have been too strong for him he should hardly have had it if he had not lost all his money the gap would not have been so wide but that he might have been inclined to throw a plank across it
he rejoiced now therefore over his loss of money as well as over his imprisonment which had made it more easy for him to follow his truest and most lasting interests
at times he wavered when he thought of how his mother who in her way as he thought had loved him would weep and think sadly over him or how perhaps she might even fall ill and die and how the blame would rest with him
at these times his resolution was near breaking but when he found i applauded his design the voice within which bade him see his father's and mother's faces no more grew louder and more persistent
if he could not cut himself adrift from those who he knew would hamper him when so small an effort was wanted his dream of a destiny was idle what was the prospect of a hundred pounds from his father in comparison with jeopardy to this
he still felt deeply the pain his disgrace had inflicted upon his father and mother but he was getting stronger and reflected that as he had run his chance with them for parents so they must run theirs with him for a son
he had nearly settled down to this conclusion when he received a letter from his father which made his decision final
if the prison rules had been interpreted strictly he would not have been allowed to have this letter for another three months as he had already heard from me but the governor took a lenient view and considered the letter from me to be a business communication hardly coming under the category of a letter from friends
theobald's letter therefore was given to his son
it ran as follows     my dear ernest my object in writing is not to upbraid you with the    disgrace and shame you have inflicted upon your mother and myself to    say nothing of your brother joey and your sister
suffer of course    we must but we know to whom to look in our affliction and are filled    with anxiety rather on your behalf than our own
your mother is    wonderful
she is pretty well in health and desires me to send you    her love
have you considered your prospects on leaving prison
i understand    from mr overton that you have lost the legacy which your grandfather    left you together with all the interest that accrued during your    minority in the course of speculation upon the stock exchange
if    you have indeed been guilty of such appalling folly it is difficult to    see what you can turn your hand to and i suppose you will try to find    a clerkship in an office
your salary will doubtless be low at first    but you have made your bed and must not complain if you have to lie    upon it
if you take pains to please your employers they will not be    backward in promoting you
when i first heard from mr overton of the unspeakable calamity which    had befallen your mother and myself i had resolved not to see you    again
i am unwilling however to have recourse to a measure which    would deprive you of your last connecting link with respectable    people
your mother and i will see you as soon as you come out of    prison not at battersbywe do not wish you to come down here at    presentbut somewhere else probably in london
you need not shrink    from seeing us we shall not reproach you
we will then decide about    your future
at present our impression is that you will find a fairer start    probably in australia or new zealand than here and i am prepared to    find you  or even if necessary so far as  pounds to pay your    passage money
once in the colony you must be dependent upon your own    exertions
may heaven prosper them and you and restore you to us years hence a    respected member of societyyour affectionate father t
pontifex
then there was a postscript in christina's writing
my darling darling boy pray with me daily and hourly that we may    yet again become a happy united godfearing family as we were before    this horrible pain fell upon usyour sorrowing but ever loving    mother c p  this letter did not produce the effect on ernest that it would have done before his imprisonment began
his father and mother thought they could take him up as they had left him off
they forgot the rapidity with which development follows misfortune if the sufferer is young and of a sound temperament
ernest made no reply to his father's letter but his desire for a total break developed into something like a passion
there are orphanages he exclaimed to himself for children who have lost their parentsoh
why why why are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them
and he brooded over the bliss of melchisedek who had been born an orphan without father without mother and without descent
chapter lxviii   when i think over all that ernest told me about his prison meditations and the conclusions he was drawn to it occurs to me that in reality he was wanting to do the very last thing which it would have entered into his head to think of wanting
i mean that he was trying to give up father and mother for christ's sake
he would have said he was giving them up because he thought they hindered him in the pursuit of his truest and most lasting happiness
granted but what is this if it is not christ
what is christ if he is not this
he who takes the highest and most selfrespecting view of his own welfare which it is in his power to conceive and adheres to it in spite of conventionality is a christian whether he knows it and calls himself one or whether he does not
a rose is not the less a rose because it does not know its own name
what if circumstances had made his duty more easy for him than it would be to most men
that was his luck as much as it is other people's luck to have other duties made easy for them by accident of birth
surely if people are born rich or handsome they have a right to their good fortune
some i know will say that one man has no right to be born with a better constitution than another others again will say that luck is the only righteous object of human veneration
both i daresay can make out a very good case but whichever may be right surely ernest had as much right to the good luck of finding a duty made easier as he had had to the bad fortune of falling into the scrape which had got him into prison
a man is not to be sneered at for having a trump card in his hand he is only to be sneered at if he plays his trump card badly
indeed i question whether it is ever much harder for anyone to give up father and mother for christ's sake than it was for ernest
the relations between the parties will have almost always been severely strained before it comes to this
i doubt whether anyone was ever yet required to give up those to whom he was tenderly attached for a mere matter of conscience he will have ceased to be tenderly attached to them long before he is called upon to break with them for differences of opinion concerning any matter of vital importance spring from differences of constitution and these will already have led to so much other disagreement that the giving up when it comes is like giving up an aching but very loose and hollow tooth
it is the loss of those whom we are not required to give up for christ's sake which is really painful to us
then there is a wrench in earnest
happily no matter how light the task that is demanded from us it is enough if we do it we reap our reward much as though it were a herculean labour
but to return the conclusion ernest came to was that he would be a tailor
he talked the matter over with the chaplain who told him there was no reason why he should not be able to earn his six or seven shillings a day by the time he came out of prison if he chose to learn the trade during the remainder of his termnot quite three months the doctor said he was strong enough for this and that it was about the only thing he was as yet fit for so he left the infirmary sooner than he would otherwise have done and entered the tailor's shop overjoyed at the thoughts of seeing his way again and confident of rising some day if he could only get a firm foothold to start from
everyone whom he had to do with saw that he did not belong to what are called the criminal classes and finding him eager to learn and to save trouble always treated him kindly and almost respectfully
he did not find the work irksome it was far more pleasant than making latin and greek verses at roughborough he felt that he would rather be here in prison than at roughborough againyes or even at cambridge itself
the only trouble he was ever in danger of getting into was through exchanging words or looks with the more decentlooking of his fellowprisoners
this was forbidden but he never missed a chance of breaking the rules in this respect
any man of his ability who was at the same time anxious to learn would of course make rapid progress and before he left prison the warder said he was as good a tailor with his three months' apprenticeship as many a man was with twelve
ernest had never before been so much praised by any of his teachers
each day as he grew stronger in health and more accustomed to his surroundings he saw some fresh advantage in his position an advantage which he had not aimed at but which had come almost in spite of himself and he marvelled at his own good fortune which had ordered things so greatly better for him than he could have ordered them for himself
his having lived six months in ashpit place was a case in point
things were possible to him which to others like him would be impossible
if such a man as towneley were told he must live henceforth in a house like those in ashpit place it would be more than he could stand
ernest could not have stood it himself if he had gone to live there of compulsion through want of money
it was only because he had felt himself able to run away at any minute that he had not wanted to do so now however that he had become familiar with life in ashpit place he no longer minded it and could live gladly in lower parts of london than that so long as he could pay his way
it was from no prudence or forethought that he had served this apprenticeship to life among the poor
he had been trying in a feeble way to be thorough in his work he had not been thorough the whole thing had been a fiasco but he had made a little puny effort in the direction of being genuine and behold in his hour of need it had been returned to him with a reward far richer than he had deserved
he could not have faced becoming one of the very poor unless he had had such a bridge to conduct him over to them as he had found unwittingly in ashpit place
true there had been drawbacks in the particular house he had chosen but he need not live in a house where there was a mr holt and he should no longer be tied to the profession which he so much hated if there were neither screams nor scripture readings he could be happy in a garret at three shillings a week such as miss maitland lived in
as he thought further he remembered that all things work together for good to them that love god was it possible he asked himself that he too however imperfectly had been trying to love him
he dared not answer yes but he would try hard that it should be so
then there came into his mind that noble air of handel's great god who yet but darkly known and he felt it as he had never felt it before
he had lost his faith in christianity but his faith in somethinghe knew not what but that there was a something as yet but darkly known which made right right and wrong wronghis faith in this grew stronger and stronger daily
again there crossed his mind thoughts of the power which he felt to be in him and of how and where it was to find its vent
the same instinct which had led him to live among the poor because it was the nearest thing to him which he could lay hold of with any clearness came to his assistance here too
he thought of the australian gold and how those who lived among it had never seen it though it abounded all around them there is gold everywhere he exclaimed inwardly to those who look for it
might not his opportunity be close upon him if he looked carefully enough at his immediate surroundings
what was his position
he had lost all
could he not turn his having lost all into an opportunity
might he not if he too sought the strength of the lord find like st paul that it was perfected in weakness
he had nothing more to lose money friends character all were gone for a very long time if not for ever but there was something else also that had taken its flight along with these
i mean the fear of that which man could do unto him
cantabil vacuus
who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already
let him but be able to earn his bread and he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who were young and loveable
herein he found so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completelyfor he saw that it was like a man's life which may be found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it
he should not have had the courage to give up all for christ's sake but now christ had mercifully taken all and lo
it seemed as though all were found
as the days went slowly by he came to see that christianity and the denial of christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do it was a fight about namesnot about things practically the church of rome the church of england and the freethinker have the same ideal standard and meet in the gentleman for he is the most perfect saint who is the most perfect gentleman
then he saw also that it matters little what profession whether of religion or irreligion a man may make provided only he follows it out with charitable inconsistency and without insisting on it to the bitter end
it is in the uncompromisingness with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or want of dogma that the danger lies
this was the crowning point of the edifice when he had got here he no longer wished to molest even the pope
the archbishop of canterbury might have hopped about all round him and even picked crumbs out of his hand without running risk of getting a sly sprinkle of salt
that wary prelate himself might perhaps have been of a different opinion but the robins and thrushes that hop about our lawns are not more needlessly distrustful of the hand that throws them out crumbs of bread in winter than the archbishop would have been of my hero
perhaps he was helped to arrive at the foregoing conclusion by an event which almost thrust inconsistency upon him
a few days after he had left the infirmary the chaplain came to his cell and told him that the prisoner who played the organ in chapel had just finished his sentence and was leaving the prison he therefore offered the post to ernest who he already knew played the organ
ernest was at first in doubt whether it would be right for him to assist at religious services more than he was actually compelled to do but the pleasure of playing the organ and the privileges which the post involved made him see excellent reasons for not riding consistency to death
having then once introduced an element of inconsistency into his system he was far too consistent not to be inconsistent consistently and he lapsed ere long into an amiable indifferentism which to outward appearance differed but little from the indifferentism from which mr hawke had aroused him
by becoming organist he was saved from the treadmill for which the doctor had said he was unfit as yet but which he would probably have been put to in due course as soon as he was stronger
he might have escaped the tailor's shop altogether and done only the comparatively light work of attending to the chaplain's rooms if he had liked but he wanted to learn as much tailoring as he could and did not therefore take advantage of this offer he was allowed however two hours a day in the afternoon for practice
from that moment his prison life ceased to be monotonous and the remaining two months of his sentence slipped by almost as rapidly as they would have done if he had been free
what with music books learning his trade and conversation with the chaplain who was just the kindly sensible person that ernest wanted in order to steady him a little the days went by so pleasantly that when the time came for him to leave prison he did so or thought he did so not without regret
chapter lxix   in coming to the conclusion that he would sever the connection between himself and his family once for all ernest had reckoned without his family
theobald wanted to be rid of his son it is true in so far as he wished him to be no nearer at any rate than the antipodes but he had no idea of entirely breaking with him
he knew his son well enough to have a pretty shrewd idea that this was what ernest would wish himself and perhaps as much for this reason as for any other he was determined to keep up the connection provided it did not involve ernest's coming to battersby nor any recurring outlay
when the time approached for him to leave prison his father and mother consulted as to what course they should adopt
we must never leave him to himself said theobald impressively we can neither of us wish that
oh no
no
dearest theobald exclaimed christina
whoever else deserts him and however distant he may be from us he must still feel that he has parents whose hearts beat with affection for him no matter how cruelly he has pained them
he has been his own worst enemy said theobald
he has never loved us as we deserved and now he will be withheld by false shame from wishing to see us
he will avoid us if he can
then we must go to him ourselves said christina whether he likes it or not we must be at his side to support him as he enters again upon the world
if we do not want him to give us the slip we must catch him as he leaves prison
we will we will our faces shall be the first to gladden his eyes as he comes out and our voices the first to exhort him to return to the paths of virtue
i think said theobald if he sees us in the street he will turn round and run away from us
he is intensely selfish
then we must get leave to go inside the prison and see him before he gets outside
after a good deal of discussion this was the plan they decided on adopting and having so decided theobald wrote to the governor of the gaol asking whether he could be admitted inside the gaol to receive ernest when his sentence had expired
he received answer in the affirmative and the pair left battersby the day before ernest was to come out of prison
ernest had not reckoned on this and was rather surprised on being told a few minutes before nine that he was to go into the receiving room before he left the prison as there were visitors waiting to see him
his heart fell for he guessed who they were but he screwed up his courage and hastened to the receiving room
there sure enough standing at the end of the table nearest the door were the two people whom he regarded as the most dangerous enemies he had in all the worldhis father and mother
he could not fly but he knew that if he wavered he was lost
his mother was crying but she sprang forward to meet him and clasped him in her arms
oh my boy my boy she sobbed and she could say no more
ernest was as white as a sheet
his heart beat so that he could hardly breathe
he let his mother embrace him and then withdrawing himself stood silently before her with the tears falling from his eyes
at first he could not speak
for a minute or so the silence on all sides was complete
then gathering strength he said in a low voice  mother it was the first time he had called her anything but mamma
we must part
on this turning to the warder he said i believe i am free to leave the prison if i wish to do so
you cannot compel me to remain here longer
please take me to the gates
theobald stepped forward
ernest you must not shall not leave us in this way
do not speak to me said ernest his eyes flashing with a fire that was unwonted in them
another warder then came up and took theobald aside while the first conducted ernest to the gates
tell them said ernest from me that they must think of me as one dead for i am dead to them
say that my greatest pain is the thought of the disgrace i have inflicted upon them and that above all things else i will study to avoid paining them hereafter but say also that if they write to me i will return their letters unopened and that if they come and see me i will protect myself in whatever way i can
by this time he was at the prison gate and in another moment was at liberty
after he had got a few steps out he turned his face to the prison wall leant against it for support and wept as though his heart would break
giving up father and mother for christ's sake was not such an easy matter after all
if a man has been possessed by devils for long enough they will rend him as they leave him however imperatively they may have been cast out
ernest did not stay long where he was for he feared each moment that his father and mother would come out
he pulled himself together and turned into the labyrinth of small streets which opened out in front of him
he had crossed his rubiconnot perhaps very heroically or dramatically but then it is only in dramas that people act dramatically
at any rate by hook or by crook he had scrambled over and was out upon the other side
already he thought of much which he would gladly have said and blamed his want of presence of mind but after all it mattered very little
inclined though he was to make very great allowances for his father and mother he was indignant at their having thrust themselves upon him without warning at a moment when the excitement of leaving prison was already as much as he was fit for
it was a mean advantage to have taken over him but he was glad they had taken it for it made him realise more fully than ever that his one chance lay in separating himself completely from them
the morning was grey and the first signs of winter fog were beginning to show themselves for it was now the th of september
ernest wore the clothes in which he had entered prison and was therefore dressed as a clergyman
no one who looked at him would have seen any difference between his present appearance and his appearance six months previously indeed as he walked slowly through the dingy crowded lane called eyre street hill which he well knew for he had clerical friends in that neighbourhood the months he had passed in prison seemed to drop out of his life and so powerfully did association carry him away that finding himself in his old dress and in his old surroundings he felt dragged back into his old selfas though his six months of prison life had been a dream from which he was now waking to take things up as he had left them
this was the effect of unchanged surroundings upon the unchanged part of him
but there was a changed part and the effect of unchanged surroundings upon this was to make everything seem almost as strange as though he had never had any life but his prison one and was now born into a new world
all our lives long every day and every hour we are engaged in the process of accommodating our changed and unchanged selves to changed and unchanged surroundings living in fact in nothing else than this process of accommodation when we fail in it a little we are stupid when we fail flagrantly we are mad when we suspend it temporarily we sleep when we give up the attempt altogether we die
in quiet uneventful lives the changes internal and external are so small that there is little or no strain in the process of fusion and accommodation in other lives there is great strain but there is also great fusing and accommodating power in others great strain with little accommodating power
a life will be successful or not according as the power of accommodation is equal to or unequal to the strain of fusing and adjusting internal and external changes
the trouble is that in the end we shall be driven to admit the unity of the universe so completely as to be compelled to deny that there is either an external or an internal but must see everything both as external and internal at one and the same time subject and objectexternal and internalbeing unified as much as everything else
this will knock our whole system over but then every system has got to be knocked over by something
much the best way out of this difficulty is to go in for separation between internal and externalsubject and objectwhen we find this convenient and unity between the same when we find unity convenient
this is illogical but extremes are alone logical and they are always absurd the mean is alone practicable and it is always illogical
it is faith and not logic which is the supreme arbiter
they say all roads lead to rome and all philosophies that i have ever seen lead ultimately either to some gross absurdity or else to the conclusion already more than once insisted on in these pages that the just shall live by faith that is to say that sensible people will get through life by rule of thumb as they may interpret it most conveniently without asking too many questions for conscience sake
take any fact and reason upon it to the bitter end and it will ere long lead to this as the only refuge from some palpable folly
but to return to my story
when ernest got to the top of the street and looked back he saw the grimy sullen walls of his prison filling up the end of it
he paused for a minute or two
there he said to himself i was hemmed in by bolts which i could see and touch here i am barred by others which are none the less realpoverty and ignorance of the world
it was no part of my business to try to break the material bolts of iron and escape from prison but now that i am free i must surely seek to break these others
he had read somewhere of a prisoner who had made his escape by cutting up his bedstead with an iron spoon
he admired and marvelled at the man's mind but could not even try to imitate him in the presence of immaterial barriers however he was not so easily daunted and felt as though even if the bed were iron and the spoon a wooden one he could find some means of making the wood cut the iron sooner or later
he turned his back upon eyre street hill and walked down leather lane into holborn
each step he took each face or object that he knew helped at once to link him on to the life he had led before his imprisonment and at the same time to make him feel how completely that imprisonment had cut his life into two parts the one of which could bear no resemblance to the other
he passed down fetter lane into fleet street and so to the temple to which i had just returned from my summer holiday
it was about half past nine and i was having my breakfast when i heard a timid knock at the door and opened it to find ernest
chapter lxx   i had begun to like him on the night towneley had sent for me and on the following day i thought he had shaped well
i had liked him also during our interview in prison and wanted to see more of him so that i might make up my mind about him
i had lived long enough to know that some men who do great things in the end are not very wise when they are young knowing that he would leave prison on the th i had expected him and as i had a spare bedroom pressed him to stay with me till he could make up his mind what he would do
being so much older than he was i anticipated no trouble in getting my own way but he would not hear of it
the utmost he would assent to was that he should be my guest till he could find a room for himself which he would set about doing at once
he was still much agitated but grew better as he ate a breakfast not of prison fare and in a comfortable room
it pleased me to see the delight he took in all about him the fireplace with a fire in it the easy chairs the times my cat the red geraniums in the window to say nothing of coffee bread and butter sausages marmalade etc
everything was pregnant with the most exquisite pleasure to him
the plane trees were full of leaf still he kept rising from the breakfast table to admire them never till now he said had he known what the enjoyment of these things really was
he ate looked laughed and cried by turns with an emotion which i can neither forget nor describe
he told me how his father and mother had lain in wait for him as he was about to leave prison
i was furious and applauded him heartily for what he had done
he was very grateful to me for this
other people he said would tell him he ought to think of his father and mother rather than of himself and it was such a comfort to find someone who saw things as he saw them himself
even if i had differed from him i should not have said so but i was of his opinion and was almost as much obliged to him for seeing things as i saw them as he to me for doing the same kind office by himself
cordially as i disliked theobald and christina i was in such a hopeless minority in the opinion i had formed concerning them that it was pleasant to find someone who agreed with me
then there came an awful moment for both of us
a knock as of a visitor and not a postman was heard at my door
goodness gracious i exclaimed why didn't we sport the oak
perhaps it is your father
but surely he would hardly come at this time of day
go at once into my bedroom
i went to the door and sure enough there were both theobald and christina
i could not refuse to let them in and was obliged to listen to their version of the story which agreed substantially with ernest's
christina cried bitterlytheobald stormed
after about ten minutes during which i assured them that i had not the faintest conception where their son was i dismissed them both
i saw they looked suspiciously upon the manifest signs that someone was breakfasting with me and parted from me more or less defiantly but i got rid of them and poor ernest came out again looking white frightened and upset
he had heard voices but no more and did not feel sure that the enemy might not be gaining over me
we sported the oak now and before long he began to recover
after breakfast we discussed the situation
i had taken away his wardrobe and books from mrs jupp's but had left his furniture pictures and piano giving mrs jupp the use of these so that she might let her room furnished in lieu of charge for taking care of the furniture
as soon as ernest heard that his wardrobe was at hand he got out a suit of clothes he had had before he had been ordained and put it on at once much as i thought to the improvement of his personal appearance
then we went into the subject of his finances
he had had ten pounds from pryer only a day or two before he was apprehended of which between seven and eight were in his purse when he entered the prison
this money was restored to him on leaving
he had always paid cash for whatever he bought so that there was nothing to be deducted for debts
besides this he had his clothes books and furniture
he could as i have said have had  pounds from his father if he had chosen to emigrate but this both ernest and i for he brought me round to his opinion agreed it would be better to decline
this was all he knew of as belonging to him
he said he proposed at once taking an unfurnished top back attic in as quiet a house as he could find say at three or four shillings a week and looking out for work as a tailor
i did not think it much mattered what he began with for i felt pretty sure he would ere long find his way to something that suited him if he could get a start with anything at all
the difficulty was how to get him started
it was not enough that he should be able to cut out and make clothesthat he should have the organs so to speak of a tailor he must be put into a tailor's shop and guided for a little while by someone who knew how and where to help him
the rest of the day he spent in looking for a room which he soon found and in familiarising himself with liberty
in the evening i took him to the olympic where robson was then acting in a burlesque on macbeth mrs keeley if i remember rightly taking the part of lady macbeth
in the scene before the murder macbeth had said he could not kill duncan when he saw his boots upon the landing
lady macbeth put a stop to her husband's hesitation by whipping him up under her arm and carrying him off the stage kicking and screaming
ernest laughed till he cried
what rot shakespeare is after this he exclaimed involuntarily
i remembered his essay on the greek tragedians and was more i epris with him than ever
next day he set about looking for employment and i did not see him till about five o'clock when he came and said that he had had no success
the same thing happened the next day and the day after that
wherever he went he was invariably refused and often ordered point blank out of the shop i could see by the expression of his face though he said nothing that he was getting frightened and began to think i should have to come to the rescue
he said he had made a great many enquiries and had always been told the same story
he found that it was easy to keep on in an old line but very hard to strike out into a new one
he talked to the fishmonger in leather lane where he went to buy a bloater for his tea casually as though from curiosity and without any interested motive
sell said the master of the shop why nobody wouldn't believe what can be sold by penn'orths and twopenn'orths if you go the right way to work
look at whelks for instance
last saturday night me and my little emma here we sold  pounds worth of whelks between eight and half past eleven o'clockand almost all in penn'orths and twopenn'orthsa few hap'orths but not many
it was the steam that did it
we kept aboiling of 'em hot and hot and whenever the steam came strong up from the cellar on to the pavement the people bought but whenever the steam went down they left off buying so we boiled them over and over again till they was all sold
that's just where it is if you know your business you can sell if you don't you'll soon make a mess of it
why but for the steam i should not have sold s
worth of whelks all the night through
this and many another yarn of kindred substance which he heard from other people determined ernest more than ever to stake on tailoring as the one trade about which he knew anything at all nevertheless here were three or four days gone by and employment seemed as far off as ever
i now did what i ought to have done before that is to say i called on my own tailor whom i had dealt with for over a quarter of a century and asked his advice
he declared ernest's plan to be hopeless
if said mr larkins for this was my tailor's name he had begun at fourteen it might have done but no man of twentyfour could stand being turned to work into a workshop full of tailors he would not get on with the men nor the men with him you could not expect him to be 'hail fellow well met' with them and you could not expect his fellowworkmen to like him if he was not
a man must have sunk low through drink or natural taste for low company before he could get on with those who have had such a different training from his own
mr larkins said a great deal more and wound up by taking me to see the place where his own men worked
this is a paradise he said compared to most workshops
what gentleman could stand this air think you for a fortnight
i was glad enough to get out of the hot fetid atmosphere in five minutes and saw that there was no brick of ernest's prison to be loosened by going and working among tailors in a workshop
mr larkins wound up by saying that even if my protege were a much better workman than he probably was no master would give him employment for fear of creating a bother among the men
i left feeling that i ought to have thought of all this myself and was more than ever perplexed as to whether i had not better let my young friend have a few thousand pounds and send him out to the colonies when on my return home at about five o'clock i found him waiting for me radiant and declaring that he had found all he wanted
chapter lxxi   it seems he had been patrolling the streets for the last three or four nightsi suppose in search of something to doat any rate knowing better what he wanted to get than how to get it
nevertheless what he wanted was in reality so easily to be found that it took a highly educated scholar like himself to be unable to find it
but however this may be he had been scared and now saw lions where there were none and was shocked and frightened and night after night his courage had failed him and he had returned to his lodgings in laystall street without accomplishing his errand
he had not taken me into his confidence upon this matter and i had not enquired what he did with himself in the evenings
at last he had concluded that however painful it might be to him he would call on mrs jupp who he thought would be able to help him if anyone could
he had been walking moodily from seven till about nine and now resolved to go straight to ashpit place and make a mother confessor of mrs jupp without more delay
of all tasks that could be performed by mortal woman there was none which mrs jupp would have liked better than the one ernest was thinking of imposing upon her nor do i know that in his scared and brokendown state he could have done much better than he now proposed
miss jupp would have made it very easy for him to open his grief to her indeed she would have coaxed it all out of him before he knew where he was but the fates were against mrs jupp and the meeting between my hero and his former landlady was postponed sine die for his determination had hardly been formed and he had not gone more than a hundred yards in the direction of mrs jupp's house when a woman accosted him
he was turning from her as he had turned from so many others when she started back with a movement that aroused his curiosity
he had hardly seen her face but being determined to catch sight of it followed her as she hurried away and passed her then turning round he saw that she was none other than ellen the housemaid who had been dismissed by his mother eight years previously
he ought to have assigned ellen's unwillingness to see him to its true cause but a guilty conscience made him think she had heard of his disgrace and was turning away from him in contempt
brave as had been his resolutions about facing the world this was more than he was prepared for what
you too shun me ellen
he exclaimed
the girl was crying bitterly and did not understand him
oh master ernest she sobbed let me go you are too good for the likes of me to speak to now
why ellen said he what nonsense you talk you haven't been in prison have you
oh no no no not so bad as that she exclaimed passionately
well i have said ernest with a forced laugh i came out three or four days ago after six months with hard labour
ellen did not believe him but she looked at him with a lor'
master ernest and dried her eyes at once
the ice was broken between them for as a matter of fact ellen had been in prison several times and though she did not believe ernest his merely saying he had been in prison made her feel more at ease with him
for her there were two classes of people those who had been in prison and those who had not
the first she looked upon as fellowcreatures and more or less christians the second with few exceptions she regarded with suspicion not wholly unmingled with contempt
then ernest told her what had happened to him during the last six months and byandby she believed him
master ernest said she after they had talked for a quarter of an hour or so there's a place over the way where they sell tripe and onions
i know you was always very fond of tripe and onions let's go over and have some and we can talk better there
so the pair crossed the street and entered the tripe shop ernest ordered supper
and how is your pore dear mamma and your dear papa master ernest said ellen who had now recovered herself and was quite at home with my hero
oh dear dear me she said i did love your pa he was a good gentleman he was and your ma too it would do anyone good to live with her i'm sure
ernest was surprised and hardly knew what to say
he had expected to find ellen indignant at the way she had been treated and inclined to lay the blame of her having fallen to her present state at his father's and mother's door
it was not so
her only recollection of battersby was as of a place where she had had plenty to eat and drink not too much hard work and where she had not been scolded
when she heard that ernest had quarrelled with his father and mother she assumed as a matter of course that the fault must lie entirely with ernest
oh your pore pore ma
said ellen
she was always so very fond of you master ernest you was always her favourite i can't abear to think of anything between you and her
to think now of the way she used to have me into the diningroom and teach me my catechism that she did
oh master ernest you really must go and make it all up with her indeed you must
ernest felt rueful but he had resisted so valiantly already that the devil might have saved himself the trouble of trying to get at him through ellen in the matter of his father and mother
he changed the subject and the pair warmed to one another as they had their tripe and pots of beer
of all people in the world ellen was perhaps the one to whom ernest could have spoken most freely at this juncture
he told her what he thought he could have told to no one else
you know ellen he concluded i had learnt as a boy things that i ought not to have learnt and had never had a chance of that which would have set me straight
gentlefolks is always like that said ellen musingly
i believe you are right but i am no longer a gentleman ellen and i don't see why i should be 'like that' any longer my dear
i want you to help me to be like something else as soon as possible
lor'
master ernest whatever can you be meaning
the pair soon afterwards left the eatinghouse and walked up fetter lane together
ellen had had hard times since she had left battersby but they had left little trace upon her
ernest saw only the freshlooking smiling face the dimpled cheek the clear blue eyes and lovely sphinxlike lips which he had remembered as a boy
at nineteen she had looked older than she was now she looked much younger indeed she looked hardly older than when ernest had last seen her and it would have taken a man of much greater experience than he possessed to suspect how completely she had fallen from her first estate
it never occurred to him that the poor condition of her wardrobe was due to her passion for ardent spirits and that first and last she had served five or six times as much time in gaol as he had
he ascribed the poverty of her attire to the attempts to keep herself respectable which ellen during supper had more than once alluded to
he had been charmed with the way in which she had declared that a pint of beer would make her tipsy and had only allowed herself to be forced into drinking the whole after a good deal of remonstrance
to him she appeared a very angel dropped from the sky and all the more easy to get on with for being a fallen one
as he walked up fetter lane with her towards laystall street he thought of the wonderful goodness of god towards him in throwing in his way the very person of all others whom he was most glad to see and whom of all others in spite of her living so near him he might have never fallen in with but for a happy accident
when people get it into their heads that they are being specially favoured by the almighty they had better as a general rule mind their p's and q's and when they think they see the devil's drift with more special clearness let them remember that he has had much more experience than they have and is probably meditating mischief
already during supper the thought that in ellen at last he had found a woman whom he could love well enough to wish to live with and marry had flitted across his mind and the more they had chatted the more reasons kept suggesting themselves for thinking that what might be folly in ordinary cases would not be folly in his
he must marry someone that was already settled
he could not marry a lady that was absurd
he must marry a poor woman
yes but a fallen one
was he not fallen himself
ellen would fall no more
he had only to look at her to be sure of this
he could not live with her in sin not for more than the shortest time that could elapse before their marriage he no longer believed in the supernatural element of christianity but the christian morality at any rate was indisputable
besides they might have children and a stigma would rest upon them
whom had he to consult but himself now
his father and mother never need know and even if they did they should be thankful to see him married to any woman who would make him happy as ellen would
as for not being able to afford marriage how did poor people do
did not a good wife rather help matters than not
where one could live two could do so and if ellen was three or four years older than he waswell what was that
have you gentle reader ever loved at first sight
when you fell in love at first sight how long let me ask did it take you to become ready to fling every other consideration to the winds except that of obtaining possession of the loved one
or rather how long would it have taken you if you had had no father or mother nothing to lose in the way of money position friends professional advancement or what not and if the object of your affections was as free from all these impedimenta as you were yourself
if you were a young john stuart mill perhaps it would have taken you some time but suppose your nature was quixotic impulsive altruistic guileless suppose you were a hungry man starving for something to love and lean upon for one whose burdens you might bear and who might help you to bear yours
suppose you were down on your luck still stunned by a horrible shock and this bright vista of a happy future floated suddenly before you how long under these circumstances do you think you would reflect before you would decide on embracing what chance had thrown in your way
it did not take my hero long for before he got past the ham and beef shop near the top of fetter lane he had told ellen that she must come home with him and live with him till they could get married which they would do upon the first day that the law allowed
i think the devil must have chuckled and made tolerably sure of his game this time
chapter lxxii   ernest told ellen of his difficulty about finding employment
but what do you think of going into a shop for my dear said ellen
why not take a little shop yourself
ernest asked how much this would cost
ellen told him that he might take a house in some small street say near the elephant and castle for s
or s
a week and let off the two top floors for s keeping the back parlour and shop for themselves
if he could raise five or six pounds to buy some secondhand clothes to stock the shop with they could mend them and clean them and she could look after the women's clothes while he did the men's
then he could mend and make if he could get the orders
they could soon make a business of  pounds a week in this way she had a friend who began like that and had now moved to a better shop where she made  or  pounds a week at leastand she ellen had done the greater part of the buying and selling herself
here was a new light indeed
it was as though he had got his  pounds back again all of a sudden and perhaps ever so much more later on into the bargain
ellen seemed more than ever to be his good genius
she went out and got a few rashers of bacon for his and her breakfast
she cooked them much more nicely than he had been able to do and laid breakfast for him and made coffee and some nice brown toast
ernest had been his own cook and housemaid for the last few days and had not given himself satisfaction
here he suddenly found himself with someone to wait on him again
not only had ellen pointed out to him how he could earn a living when no one except himself had known how to advise him but here she was so pretty and smiling looking after even his comforts and restoring him practically in all respects that he much cared about to the position which he had lostor rather putting him in one that he already liked much better
no wonder he was radiant when he came to explain his plans to me
he had some difficulty in telling all that had happened
he hesitated blushed hummed and hawed
misgivings began to cross his mind when he found himself obliged to tell his story to someone else
he felt inclined to slur things over but i wanted to get at the facts so i helped him over the bad places and questioned him till i had got out pretty nearly the whole story as i have given it above
i hope i did not show it but i was very angry
i had begun to like ernest
i don't know why but i never have heard that any young man to whom i had become attached was going to get married without hating his intended instinctively though i had never seen her i have observed that most bachelors feel the same thing though we are generally at some pains to hide the fact
perhaps it is because we know we ought to have got married ourselves
ordinarily we say we are delightedin the present case i did not feel obliged to do this though i made an effort to conceal my vexation
that a young man of much promise who was heir also to what was now a handsome fortune should fling himself away upon such a person as ellen was quite too provoking and the more so because of the unexpectedness of the whole affair
i begged him not to marry ellen yetnot at least until he had known her for a longer time
he would not hear of it he had given his word and if he had not given it he should go and give it at once
i had hitherto found him upon most matters singularly docile and easy to manage but on this point i could do nothing with him
his recent victory over his father and mother had increased his strength and i was nowhere
i would have told him of his true position but i knew very well that this would only make him more bent on having his own wayfor with so much money why should he not please himself
i said nothing therefore on this head and yet all that i could urge went for very little with one who believed himself to be an artisan or nothing
really from his own standpoint there was nothing very outrageous in what he was doing
he had known and been very fond of ellen years before
he knew her to come of respectable people and to have borne a good character and to have been universally liked at battersby
she was then a quick smart hardworking girland a very pretty one
when at last they met again she was on her best behaviour in fact she was modesty and demureness itself
what wonder then that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked
he knew too much against himself and was too bankrupt in love to be squeamish if ellen had been only what he thought her and if his prospects had been in reality no better than he believed they were i do not know that there is anything much more imprudent in what ernest proposed than there is in half the marriages that take place every day
there was nothing for it however but to make the best of the inevitable so i wished my young friend good fortune and told him he could have whatever money he wanted to start his shop with if what he had in hand was not sufficient
he thanked me asked me to be kind enough to let him do all my mending and repairing and to get him any other like orders that i could and left me to my own reflections
i was even more angry when he was gone than i had been while he was with me
his frank boyish face had beamed with a happiness that had rarely visited it
except at cambridge he had hardly known what happiness meant and even there his life had been clouded as of a man for whom wisdom at the greatest of its entrances was quite shut out
i had seen enough of the world and of him to have observed this but it was impossible or i thought it had been impossible for me to have helped him
whether i ought to have tried to help him or not i do not know but i am sure that the young of all animals often do want help upon matters about which anyone would say a priori that there should be no difficulty
one would think that a young seal would want no teaching how to swim nor yet a bird to fly but in practice a young seal drowns if put out of its depth before its parents have taught it to swim and so again even the young hawk must be taught to fly before it can do so
i grant that the tendency of the times is to exaggerate the good which teaching can do but in trying to teach too much in most matters we have neglected others in respect of which a little sensible teaching would do no harm
i know it is the fashion to say that young people must find out things for themselves and so they probably would if they had fair play to the extent of not having obstacles put in their way
but they seldom have fair play as a general rule they meet with foul play and foul play from those who live by selling them stones made into a great variety of shapes and sizes so as to form a tolerable imitation of bread
some are lucky enough to meet with few obstacles some are plucky enough to override them but in the greater number of cases if people are saved at all they are saved so as by fire
while ernest was with me ellen was looking out for a shop on the south side of the thames near the elephant and castle which was then almost a new and a very rising neighbourhood
by one o'clock she had found several from which a selection was to be made and before night the pair had made their choice
ernest brought ellen to me
i did not want to see her but could not well refuse
he had laid out a few of his shillings upon her wardrobe so that she was neatly dressed and indeed she looked very pretty and so good that i could hardly be surprised at ernest's infatuation when the other circumstances of the case were taken into consideration
of course we hated one another instinctively from the first moment we set eyes on one another but we each told ernest that we had been most favourably impressed
then i was taken to see the shop
an empty house is like a stray dog or a body from which life has departed
decay sets in at once in every part of it and what mould and wind and weather would spare street boys commonly destroy
ernest's shop in its untenanted state was a dirty unsavoury place enough
the house was not old but it had been run up by a jerrybuilder and its constitution had no stamina whatever
it was only by being kept warm and quiet that it would remain in health for many months together
now it had been empty for some weeks and the cats had got in by night while the boys had broken the windows by day
the parlour floor was covered with stones and dirt and in the area was a dead dog which had been killed in the street and been thrown down into the first unprotected place that could be found
there was a strong smell throughout the house but whether it was bugs or rats or cats or drains or a compound of all four i could not determine
the sashes did not fit the flimsy doors hung badly the skirting was gone in several places and there were not a few holes in the floor the locks were loose and paper was torn and dirty the stairs were weak and one felt the treads give as one went up them
over and above these drawbacks the house had an ill name by reason of the fact that the wife of the last occupant had hanged herself in it not very many weeks previously
she had set down a bloater before the fire for her husband's tea and had made him a round of toast
she then left the room as though about to return to it shortly but instead of doing so she went into the back kitchen and hanged herself without a word
it was this which had kept the house empty so long in spite of its excellent position as a corner shop
the last tenant had left immediately after the inquest and if the owner had had it done up then people would have got over the tragedy that had been enacted in it but the combination of bad condition and bad fame had hindered many from taking it who like ellen could see that it had great business capabilities
almost anything would have sold there but it happened also that there was no secondhand clothes shop in close proximity so that everything combined in its favour except its filthy state and its reputation
when i saw it i thought i would rather die than live in such an awful placebut then i had been living in the temple for the last five and twenty years
ernest was lodging in laystall street and had just come out of prison before this he had lived in ashpit place so that this house had no terrors for him provided he could get it done up
the difficulty was that the landlord was hard to move in this respect
it ended in my finding the money to do everything that was wanted and taking a lease of the house for five years at the same rental as that paid by the last occupant
i then sublet it to ernest of course taking care that it was put more efficiently into repair than his landlord was at all likely to have put it
a week later i called and found everything so completely transformed that i should hardly have recognised the house
all the ceilings had been whitewashed all the rooms papered the broken glass hacked out and reinstated the defective woodwork renewed all the sashes cupboards and doors had been painted
the drains had been thoroughly overhauled everything in fact that could be done had been done and the rooms now looked as cheerful as they had been forbidding when i had last seen them
the people who had done the repairs were supposed to have cleaned the house down before leaving but ellen had given it another scrub from top to bottom herself after they were gone and it was as clean as a new pin
i almost felt as though i could have lived in it myself and as for ernest he was in the seventh heaven
he said it was all my doing and ellen's
there was already a counter in the shop and a few fittings so that nothing now remained but to get some stock and set them out for sale
ernest said he could not begin better than by selling his clerical wardrobe and his books for though the shop was intended especially for the sale of secondhand clothes yet ellen said there was no reason why they should not sell a few books too so a beginning was to be made by selling the books he had had at school and college at about one shilling a volume taking them all round and i have heard him say that he learned more that proved of practical use to him through stocking his books on a bench in front of his shop and selling them than he had done from all the years of study which he had bestowed upon their contents
for the enquiries that were made of him whether he had such and such a book taught him what he could sell and what he could not how much he could get for this and how much for that
having made ever such a little beginning with books he took to attending book sales as well as clothes sales and ere long this branch of his business became no less important than the tailoring and would i have no doubt have been the one which he would have settled down to exclusively if he had been called upon to remain a tradesman but this is anticipating
i made a contribution and a stipulation
ernest wanted to sink the gentleman completely until such time as he could work his way up again
if he had been left to himself he would have lived with ellen in the shop back parlour and kitchen and have let out both the upper floors according to his original programme
i did not want him however to cut himself adrift from music letters and polite life and feared that unless he had some kind of den into which he could retire he would ere long become the tradesman and nothing else
i therefore insisted on taking the first floor front and back myself and furnishing them with the things which had been left at mrs jupp's
i bought these things of him for a small sum and had them moved into his present abode
i went to mrs jupp's to arrange all this as ernest did not like going to ashpit place
i had half expected to find the furniture sold and mrs jupp gone but it was not so with all her faults the poor old woman was perfectly honest
i told her that pryer had taken all ernest's money and run away with it
she hated pryer
i never knew anyone she exclaimed as whitelivered in the face as that pryer he hasn't got an upright vein in his whole body
why all that time when he used to come breakfasting with mr pontifex morning after morning it took me to a perfect shadow the way he carried on
there was no doing anything to please him right
first i used to get them eggs and bacon and he didn't like that and then i got him a bit of fish and he didn't like that or else it was too dear and you know fish is dearer than ever and then i got him a bit of german and he said it rose on him then i tried sausages and he said they hit him in the eye worse even than german oh
how i used to wander my room and fret about it inwardly and cry for hours and all about them paltry breakfastsand it wasn't mr pontifex he'd like anything that anyone chose to give him
and so the piano's to go she continued
what beautiful tunes mr pontifex did play upon it to be sure and there was one i liked better than any i ever heard
i was in the room when he played it once and when i said 'oh mr pontifex that's the kind of woman i am' he said 'no mrs jupp it isn't for this tune is old but no one can say you are old'
but bless you he meant nothing by it it was only his mucky flattery
like myself she was vexed at his getting married
she didn't like his being married and she didn't like his not being marriedbut anyhow it was ellen's fault not his and she hoped he would be happy
but after all she concluded it ain't you and it ain't me and it ain't him and it ain't her
it's what you must call the fortunes of matterimony for there ain't no other word for it
in the course of the afternoon the furniture arrived at ernest's new abode
in the first floor we placed the piano table pictures bookshelves a couple of armchairs and all the little household gods which he had brought from cambridge
the back room was furnished exactly as his bedroom at ashpit place had beennew things being got for the bridal apartment downstairs
these two firstfloor rooms i insisted on retaining as my own but ernest was to use them whenever he pleased he was never to sublet even the bedroom but was to keep it for himself in case his wife should be ill at any time or in case he might be ill himself
in less than a fortnight from the time of his leaving prison all these arrangements had been completed and ernest felt that he had again linked himself on to the life which he had led before his imprisonmentwith a few important differences however which were greatly to his advantage
he was no longer a clergyman he was about to marry a woman to whom he was much attached and he had parted company for ever with his father and mother
true he had lost all his money his reputation and his position as a gentleman he had in fact had to burn his house down in order to get his roast sucking pig but if asked whether he would rather be as he was now or as he was on the day before his arrest he would not have had a moment's hesitation in preferring his present to his past
if his present could only have been purchased at the expense of all that he had gone through it was still worth purchasing at the price and he would go through it all again if necessary
the loss of the money was the worst but ellen said she was sure they would get on and she knew all about it
as for the loss of reputationconsidering that he had ellen and me left it did not come to much
i saw the house on the afternoon of the day on which all was finished and there remained nothing but to buy some stock and begin selling
when i was gone after he had had his tea he stole up to his castlethe first floor front
he lit his pipe and sat down to the piano
he played handel for an hour or so and then set himself to the table to read and write
he took all his sermons and all the theological works he had begun to compose during the time he had been a clergyman and put them in the fire as he saw them consume he felt as though he had got rid of another incubus
then he took up some of the little pieces he had begun to write during the latter part of his undergraduate life at cambridge and began to cut them about and rewrite them
as he worked quietly at these till he heard the clock strike ten and it was time to go to bed he felt that he was now not only happy but supremely happy
next day ellen took him to debenham's auction rooms and they surveyed the lots of clothes which were hung up all round the auction room to be viewed
ellen had had sufficient experience to know about how much each lot ought to fetch she overhauled lot after lot and valued it in a very short time ernest himself began to have a pretty fair idea what each lot should go for and before the morning was over valued a dozen lots running at prices about which ellen said he would not hurt if he could get them for that
so far from disliking this work or finding it tedious he liked it very much indeed he would have liked anything which did not overtax his physical strength and which held out a prospect of bringing him in money
ellen would not let him buy anything on the occasion of this sale she said he had better see one sale first and watch how prices actually went
so at twelve o'clock when the sale began he saw the lots sold which he and ellen had marked and by the time the sale was over he knew enough to be able to bid with safety whenever he should actually want to buy
knowledge of this sort is very easily acquired by anyone who is in bona fide want of it
but ellen did not want him to buy at auctionsnot much at least at present
private dealing she said was best
if i for example had any castoff clothes he was to buy them from my laundress and get a connection with other laundresses to whom he might give a trifle more than they got at present for whatever clothes their masters might give them and yet make a good profit
if gentlemen sold their things he was to try and get them to sell to him
he flinched at nothing perhaps he would have flinched if he had had any idea how outre his proceedings were but the very ignorance of the world which had ruined him up till now by a happy irony began to work its own cure
if some malignant fairy had meant to curse him in this respect she had overdone her malice
he did not know he was doing anything strange
he only knew that he had no money and must provide for himself a wife and a possible family
more than this he wanted to have some leisure in an evening so that he might read and write and keep up his music
if anyone would show him how he could do better than he was doing he should be much obliged to them but to himself it seemed that he was doing sufficiently well for at the end of the first week the pair found they had made a clear profit of  pounds
in a few weeks this had increased to  pounds and by the new year they had made a profit of  pounds in one week
ernest had by this time been married some two months for he had stuck to his original plan of marrying ellen on the first day he could legally do so
this date was a little delayed by the change of abode from laystall street to blackfriars but on the first day that it could be done it was done
he had never had more than  pounds a year even in the times of his affluence so that a profit of  pounds a week if it could be maintained steadily would place him where he had been as far as income went and though he should have to feed two mouths instead of one yet his expenses in other ways were so much curtailed by his changed social position that take it all round his income was practically what it had been a twelvemonth before
the next thing to do was to increase it and put by money
prosperity depends as we all know in great measure upon energy and good sense but it also depends not a little upon pure luckthat is to say upon connections which are in such a tangle that it is more easy to say that they do not exist than to try to trace them
a neighbourhood may have an excellent reputation as being likely to be a rising one and yet may become suddenly eclipsed by another which no one would have thought so promising
a fever hospital may divert the stream of business or a new station attract it so little indeed can be certainly known that it is better not to try to know more than is in everybody's mouth and to leave the rest to chance
luck which certainly had not been too kind to my hero hitherto now seemed to have taken him under her protection
the neighbourhood prospered and he with it
it seemed as though he no sooner bought a thing and put it into his shop than it sold with a profit of from thirty to fifty per cent
he learned bookkeeping and watched his accounts carefully following up any success immediately he began to buy other things besides clothessuch as books music odds and ends of furniture etc
whether it was luck or business aptitude or energy or the politeness with which he treated all his customers i cannot saybut to the surprise of no one more than himself he went ahead faster than he had anticipated even in his wildest dreams and by easter was established in a strong position as the owner of a business which was bringing him in between four and five hundred a year and which he understood how to extend
chapter lxxiii   ellen and he got on capitally all the better perhaps because the disparity between them was so great that neither did ellen want to be elevated nor did ernest want to elevate her
he was very fond of her and very kind to her they had interests which they could serve in common they had antecedents with a good part of which each was familiar they had each of them excellent tempers and this was enough
ellen did not seem jealous at ernest's preferring to sit the greater part of his time after the day's work was done in the first floor front where i occasionally visited him
she might have come and sat with him if she had liked but somehow or other she generally found enough to occupy her down below
she had the tact also to encourage him to go out of an evening whenever he had a mind without in the least caring that he should take her tooand this suited ernest very well
he was i should say much happier in his married life than people generally are
at first it had been very painful to him to meet any of his old friends as he sometimes accidentally did but this soon passed either they cut him or he cut them it was not nice being cut for the first time or two but after that it became rather pleasant than not and when he began to see that he was going ahead he cared very little what people might say about his antecedents
the ordeal is a painful one but if a man's moral and intellectual constitution are naturally sound there is nothing which will give him so much strength of character as having been well cut
it was easy for him to keep his expenditure down for his tastes were not luxurious
he liked theatres outings into the country on a sunday and tobacco but he did not care for much else except writing and music
as for the usual run of concerts he hated them
he worshipped handel he liked offenbach and the airs that went about the streets but he cared for nothing between these two extremes
music therefore cost him little
as for theatres i got him and ellen as many orders as they liked so these cost them nothing
the sunday outings were a small item for a shilling or two he could get a return ticket to some place far enough out of town to give him a good walk and a thorough change for the day
ellen went with him the first few times but she said she found it too much for her there were a few of her old friends whom she should sometimes like to see and they and he she said would not hit it off perhaps too well so it would be better for him to go alone
this seemed so sensible and suited ernest so exactly that he readily fell into it nor did he suspect dangers which were apparent enough to me when i heard how she had treated the matter
i kept silence however and for a time all continued to go well
as i have said one of his chief pleasures was in writing
if a man carries with him a little sketch book and is continually jotting down sketches he has the artistic instinct a hundred things may hinder his due development but the instinct is there
the literary instinct may be known by a man's keeping a small notebook in his waistcoat pocket into which he jots down anything that strikes him or any good thing that he hears said or a reference to any passage which he thinks will come in useful to him
ernest had such a notebook always with him
even when he was at cambridge he had begun the practice without anyone's having suggested it to him
these notes he copied out from time to time into a book which as they accumulated he was driven into indexing approximately as he went along
when i found out this i knew that he had the literary instinct and when i saw his notes i began to hope great things of him
for a long time i was disappointed
he was kept back by the nature of the subjects he chosewhich were generally metaphysical
in vain i tried to get him away from these to matters which had a greater interest for the general public
when i begged him to try his hand at some pretty graceful little story which should be full of whatever people knew and liked best he would immediately set to work upon a treatise to show the grounds on which all belief rested
you are stirring mud said i or poking at a sleeping dog
you are trying to make people resume consciousness about things which with sensible men have already passed into the unconscious stage
the men whom you would disturb are in front of you and not as you fancy behind you it is you who are the lagger not they
he could not see it
he said he was engaged on an essay upon the famous quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus of st vincent de lerins
this was the more provoking because he showed himself able to do better things if he had liked
i was then at work upon my burlesque the impatient griselda and was sometimes at my wits' end for a piece of business or a situation he gave me many suggestions all of which were marked by excellent good sense
nevertheless i could not prevail with him to put philosophy on one side and was obliged to leave him to himself
for a long time as i have said his choice of subjects continued to be such as i could not approve
he was continually studying scientific and metaphysical writers in the hope of either finding or making for himself a philosopher's stone in the shape of a system which should go on all fours under all circumstances instead of being liable to be upset at every touch and turn as every system yet promulgated has turned out to be
he kept to the pursuit of this willo'thewisp so long that i gave up hope and set him down as another fly that had been caught as it were by a piece of paper daubed over with some sticky stuff that had not even the merit of being sweet but to my surprise he at last declared that he was satisfied and had found what he wanted
i supposed that he had only hit upon some new lo here
when to my relief he told me that he had concluded that no system which should go perfectly upon all fours was possible inasmuch as no one could get behind bishop berkeley and therefore no absolutely incontrovertible first premise could ever be laid
having found this he was just as well pleased as if he had found the most perfect system imaginable
all he wanted he said was to know which way it was to bethat is to say whether a system was possible or not and if possible then what the system was to be
having found out that no system based on absolute certainty was possible he was contented
i had only a very vague idea who bishop berkeley was but was thankful to him for having defended us from an incontrovertible first premise
i am afraid i said a few words implying that after a great deal of trouble he had arrived at the conclusion which sensible people reach without bothering their brains so much
he said yes but i was not born sensible
a child of ordinary powers learns to walk at a year or two old without knowing much about it failing ordinary powers he had better learn laboriously than never learn at all
i am sorry i was not stronger but to do as i did was my only chance
he looked so meek that i was vexed with myself for having said what i had more especially when i remembered his bringingup which had doubtless done much to impair his power of taking a commonsense view of things
he continued  i see it all now
the people like towneley are the only ones who know anything that is worth knowing and like that of course i can never be
but to make towneleys possible there must be hewers of wood and drawers of watermen in fact through whom conscious knowledge must pass before it can reach those who can apply it gracefully and instinctively as the towneleys can
i am a hewer of wood but if i accept the position frankly and do not set up to be a towneley it does not matter
he still therefore stuck to science instead of turning to literature proper as i hoped he would have done but he confined himself henceforth to enquiries on specific subjects concerning which an increase of our knowledgeas he saidwas possible
having in fact after infinite vexation of spirit arrived at a conclusion which cut at the roots of all knowledge he settled contentedly down to the pursuit of knowledge and has pursued it ever since in spite of occasional excursions into the regions of literature proper
but this is anticipating and may perhaps also convey a wrong impression for from the outset he did occasionally turn his attention to work which must be more properly called literary than either scientific or metaphysical
chapter lxxiv   about six months after he had set up his shop his prosperity had reached its climax
it seemed even then as though he were likely to go ahead no less fast than heretofore and i doubt not that he would have done so if success or nonsuccess had depended upon himself alone
unfortunately he was not the only person to be reckoned with
one morning he had gone out to attend some sales leaving his wife perfectly well as usual in good spirits and looking very pretty
when he came back he found her sitting on a chair in the back parlour with her hair over her face sobbing and crying as though her heart would break
she said she had been frightened in the morning by a man who had pretended to be a customer and had threatened her unless she gave him some things and she had had to give them to him in order to save herself from violence she had been in hysterics ever since the man had gone
this was her story but her speech was so incoherent that it was not easy to make out what she said
ernest knew she was with child and thinking this might have something to do with the matter would have sent for a doctor if ellen had not begged him not to do so
anyone who had had experience of drunken people would have seen at a glance what the matter was but my hero knew nothing about themnothing that is to say about the drunkenness of the habitual drunkard which shows itself very differently from that of one who gets drunk only once in a way
the idea that his wife could drink had never even crossed his mind indeed she always made a fuss about taking more than a very little beer and never touched spirits
he did not know much more about hysterics than he did about drunkenness but he had always heard that women who were about to become mothers were liable to be easily upset and were often rather flighty so he was not greatly surprised and thought he had settled the matter by registering the discovery that being about to become a father has its troublesome as well as its pleasant side
the great change in ellen's life consequent upon her meeting ernest and getting married had for a time actually sobered her by shaking her out of her old ways
drunkenness is so much a matter of habit and habit so much a matter of surroundings that if you completely change the surroundings you will sometimes get rid of the drunkenness altogether
ellen had intended remaining always sober henceforward and never having had so long a steady fit before believed she was now cured
so she perhaps would have been if she had seen none of her old acquaintances
when however her new life was beginning to lose its newness and when her old acquaintances came to see her her present surroundings became more like her past and on this she herself began to get like her past too
at first she only got a little tipsy and struggled against a relapse but it was no use she soon lost the heart to fight and now her object was not to try and keep sober but to get gin without her husband's finding it out
so the hysterics continued and she managed to make her husband still think that they were due to her being about to become a mother
the worse her attacks were the more devoted he became in his attention to her
at last he insisted that a doctor should see her
the doctor of course took in the situation at a glance but said nothing to ernest except in such a guarded way that he did not understand the hints that were thrown out to him
he was much too downright and matter of fact to be quick at taking hints of this sort
he hoped that as soon as his wife's confinement was over she would regain her health and had no thought save how to spare her as far as possible till that happy time should come
in the mornings she was generally better as long that is to say as ernest remained at home but he had to go out buying and on his return would generally find that she had had another attack as soon as he had left the house
at times she would laugh and cry for half an hour together at others she would lie in a semicomatose state upon the bed and when he came back he would find that the shop had been neglected and all the work of the household left undone
still he took it for granted that this was all part of the usual course when women were going to become mothers and when ellen's share of the work settled down more and more upon his own shoulders he did it all and drudged away without a murmur
nevertheless he began to feel in a vague way more as he had felt in ashpit place at roughborough or at battersby and to lose the buoyancy of spirits which had made another man of him during the first six months of his married life
it was not only that he had to do so much household work for even the cooking cleaning up slops bedmaking and firelighting ere long devolved upon him but his business no longer prospered
he could buy as hitherto but ellen seemed unable to sell as she had sold at first
the fact was that she sold as well as ever but kept back part of the proceeds in order to buy gin and she did this more and more till even the unsuspecting ernest ought to have seen that she was not telling the truth
when she sold betterthat is to say when she did not think it safe to keep back more than a certain amount she got money out of him on the plea that she had a longing for this or that and that it would perhaps irreparably damage the baby if her longing was denied her
all seemed right reasonable and unavoidable nevertheless ernest saw that until the confinement was over he was likely to have a hard time of it
all however would then come right again
chapter lxxv   in the month of september  a girl was born and ernest was proud and happy
the birth of the child and a rather alarming talk which the doctor had given to ellen sobered her for a few weeks and it really seemed as though his hopes were about to be fulfilled
the expenses of his wife's confinement were heavy and he was obliged to trench upon his savings but he had no doubt about soon recouping this now that ellen was herself again for a time indeed his business did revive a little nevertheless it seemed as though the interruption to his prosperity had in some way broken the spell of good luck which had attended him in the outset he was still sanguine however and worked night and day with a will but there was no more music or reading or writing now
his sunday outings were put a stop to and but for the first floor being let to myself he would have lost his citadel there too but he seldom used it for ellen had to wait more and more upon the baby and as a consequence ernest had to wait more and more upon ellen
one afternoon about a couple of months after the baby had been born and just as my unhappy hero was beginning to feel more hopeful and therefore better able to bear his burdens he returned from a sale and found ellen in the same hysterical condition that he had found her in in the spring
she said she was again with child and ernest still believed her
all the troubles of the preceding six months began again then and there and grew worse and worse continually
money did not come in quickly for ellen cheated him by keeping it back and dealing improperly with the goods he bought
when it did come in she got it out of him as before on pretexts which it seemed inhuman to inquire into
it was always the same story
by and by a new feature began to show itself
ernest had inherited his father's punctuality and exactness as regards money he liked to know the worst of what he had to pay at once he hated having expenses sprung upon him which if not foreseen might and ought to have been so but now bills began to be brought to him for things ordered by ellen without his knowledge or for which he had already given her the money
this was awful and even ernest turned
when he remonstrated with hernot for having bought the things but for having said nothing to him about the moneys being owingellen met him with hysteria and there was a scene
she had now pretty well forgotten the hard times she had known when she had been on her own resources and reproached him downright with having married heron that moment the scales fell from ernest's eyes as they had fallen when towneley had said no no no
he said nothing but he woke up once for all to the fact that he had made a mistake in marrying
a touch had again come which had revealed him to himself
he went upstairs to the disused citadel flung himself into the armchair and covered his face with his hands
he still did not know that his wife drank but he could no longer trust her and his dream of happiness was over
he had been saved from the churchso as by fire but still savedbut what could now save him from his marriage
he had made the same mistake that he had made in wedding himself to the church but with a hundred times worse results
he had learnt nothing by experience he was an esauone of those wretches whose hearts the lord had hardened who having ears heard not having eyes saw not and who should find no place for repentance though they sought it even with tears
yet had he not on the whole tried to find out what the ways of god were and to follow them in singleness of heart
to a certain extent yes but he had not been thorough he had not given up all for god
he knew that very well he had done little as compared with what he might and ought to have done but still if he was being punished for this god was a hard taskmaster and one too who was continually pouncing out upon his unhappy creatures from ambuscades
in marrying ellen he had meant to avoid a life of sin and to take the course he believed to be moral and right
with his antecedents and surroundings it was the most natural thing in the world for him to have done yet in what a frightful position had not his morality landed him
could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one
what was morality worth if it was not that which on the whole brought a man peace at the last and could anyone have reasonable certainty that marriage would do this
it seemed to him that in his attempt to be moral he had been following a devil which had disguised itself as an angel of light
but if so what ground was there on which a man might rest the sole of his foot and tread in reasonable safety
he was still too young to reach the answer on common sensean answer which he would have felt to be unworthy of anyone who had an ideal standard
however this might be it was plain that he had now done for himself
it had been thus with him all his life
if there had come at any time a gleam of sunshine and hope it was to be obscured immediatelywhy prison was happier than this
there at any rate he had had no money anxieties and these were beginning to weigh upon him now with all their horrors
he was happier even now than he had been at battersby or at roughborough and he would not now go back even if he could to his cambridge life but for all that the outlook was so gloomy in fact so hopeless that he felt as if he could have only too gladly gone to sleep and died in his armchair once for all
as he was musing thus and looking upon the wreck of his hopesfor he saw well enough that as long as he was linked to ellen he should never rise as he had dreamed of doinghe heard a noise below and presently a neighbour ran upstairs and entered his room hurriedly  good gracious mr pontifex she exclaimed for goodness' sake come down quickly and help
o mrs pontifex is took with the horrorsand she's orkard
the unhappy man came down as he was bid and found his wife mad with delirium tremens
he knew all now
the neighbours thought he must have known that his wife drank all along but ellen had been so artful and he so simple that as i have said he had had no suspicion
why said the woman who had summoned him she'll drink anything she can stand up and pay her money for
ernest could hardly believe his ears but when the doctor had seen his wife and she had become more quiet he went over to the public house hard by and made enquiries the result of which rendered further doubt impossible
the publican took the opportunity to present my hero with a bill of several pounds for bottles of spirits supplied to his wife and what with his wife's confinement and the way business had fallen off he had not the money to pay with for the sum exceeded the remnant of his savings
he came to menot for money but to tell me his miserable story
i had seen for some time that there was something wrong and had suspected pretty shrewdly what the matter was but of course i said nothing
ernest and i had been growing apart for some time
i was vexed at his having married and he knew i was vexed though i did my best to hide it
a man's friendships are like his will invalidated by marriagebut they are also no less invalidated by the marriage of his friends
the rift in friendship which invariably makes its appearance on the marriage of either of the parties to it was fast widening as it no less invariably does into the great gulf which is fixed between the married and the unmarried and i was beginning to leave my protege to a fate with which i had neither right nor power to meddle
in fact i had begun to feel him rather a burden i did not so much mind this when i could be of use but i grudged it when i could be of none
he had made his bed and he must lie upon it
ernest had felt all this and had seldom come near me till now one evening late in  he called on me and with a very woebegone face told me his troubles
as soon as i found that he no longer liked his wife i forgave him at once and was as much interested in him as ever
there is nothing an old bachelor likes better than to find a young married man who wishes he had not got marriedespecially when the case is such an extreme one that he need not pretend to hope that matters will come all right again or encourage his young friend to make the best of it
i was myself in favour of a separation and said i would make ellen an allowance myselfof course intending that it should come out of ernest's money but he would not hear of this
he had married ellen he said and he must try to reform her
he hated it but he must try and finding him as usual very obstinate i was obliged to acquiesce though with little confidence as to the result
i was vexed at seeing him waste himself upon such a barren task and again began to feel him burdensome
i am afraid i showed this for he again avoided me for some time and indeed for many months i hardly saw him at all
ellen remained very ill for some days and then gradually recovered
ernest hardly left her till she was out of danger
when she had recovered he got the doctor to tell her that if she had such another attack she would certainly die this so frightened her that she took the pledge
then he became more hopeful again
when she was sober she was just what she was during the first days of her married life and so quick was he to forget pain that after a few days he was as fond of her as ever
but ellen could not forgive him for knowing what he did
she knew that he was on the watch to shield her from temptation and though he did his best to make her think that he had no further uneasiness about her she found the burden of her union with respectability grow more and more heavy upon her and looked back more and more longingly upon the lawless freedom of the life she had led before she met her husband
i will dwell no longer on this part of my story
during the spring months of  she kept straightshe had had her fling of dissipation and this together with the impression made upon her by her having taken the pledge tamed her for a while
the shop went fairly well and enabled ernest to make the two ends meet
in the spring and summer of  he even put by a little money again
in the autumn his wife was confined of a boya very fine one so everyone said
she soon recovered and ernest was beginning to breathe freely and be almost sanguine when without a word of warning the storm broke again
he returned one afternoon about two years after his marriage and found his wife lying upon the floor insensible
from this time he became hopeless and began to go visibly down hill
he had been knocked about too much and the luck had gone too long against him
the wear and tear of the last three years had told on him and though not actually ill he was overworked below par and unfit for any further burden
he struggled for a while to prevent himself from finding this out but facts were too strong for him
again he called on me and told me what had happened
i was glad the crisis had come i was sorry for ellen but a complete separation from her was the only chance for her husband
even after this last outbreak he was unwilling to consent to this and talked nonsense about dying at his post till i got tired of him
each time i saw him the old gloom had settled more and more deeply upon his face and i had about made up my mind to put an end to the situation by a coup de main such as bribing ellen to run away with somebody else or something of that kind when matters settled themselves as usual in a way which i had not anticipated
chapter lxxvi   the winter had been a trying one
ernest had only paid his way by selling his piano
with this he seemed to cut away the last link that connected him with his earlier life and to sink once for all into the small shopkeeper
it seemed to him that however low he might sink his pain could not last much longer for he should simply die if it did
he hated ellen now and the pair lived in open want of harmony with each other
if it had not been for his children he would have left her and gone to america but he could not leave the children with ellen and as for taking them with him he did not know how to do it nor what to do with them when he had got them to america
if he had not lost energy he would probably in the end have taken the children and gone off but his nerve was shaken so day after day went by and nothing was done
he had only got a few shillings in the world now except the value of his stock which was very little he could get perhaps  or  pounds by selling his music and what few pictures and pieces of furniture still belonged to him
he thought of trying to live by his pen but his writing had dropped off long ago he no longer had an idea in his head
look which way he would he saw no hope the end if it had not actually come was within easy distance and he was almost face to face with actual want
when he saw people going about poorly clad or even without shoes and stockings he wondered whether within a few months' time he too should not have to go about in this way
the remorseless resistless hand of fate had caught him in its grip and was dragging him down down down
still he staggered on going his daily rounds buying secondhand clothes and spending his evenings in cleaning and mending them
one morning as he was returning from a house at the west end where he had bought some clothes from one of the servants he was struck by a small crowd which had gathered round a space that had been railed off on the grass near one of the paths in the green park
it was a lovely soft spring morning at the end of march and unusually balmy for the time of year even ernest's melancholy was relieved for a while by the look of spring that pervaded earth and sky but it soon returned and smiling sadly he said to himself it may bring hope to others but for me there can be no hope henceforth
as these words were in his mind he joined the small crowd who were gathered round the railings and saw that they were looking at three sheep with very small lambs only a day or two old which had been penned off for shelter and protection from the others that ranged the park
they were very pretty and londoners so seldom get a chance of seeing lambs that it was no wonder every one stopped to look at them
ernest observed that no one seemed fonder of them than a great lubberly butcher boy who leaned up against the railings with a tray of meat upon his shoulder
he was looking at this boy and smiling at the grotesqueness of his admiration when he became aware that he was being watched intently by a man in coachman's livery who had also stopped to admire the lambs and was leaning against the opposite side of the enclosure
ernest knew him in a moment as john his father's old coachman at battersby and went up to him at once
why master ernest said he with his strong northern accent i was thinking of you only this very morning and the pair shook hands heartily
john was in an excellent place at the west end
he had done very well he said ever since he had left battersby except for the first year or two and that he said with a screw of the face had well nigh broke him
ernest asked how this was
why you see said john i was always main fond of that lass ellen whom you remember running after master ernest and giving your watch to
i expect you haven't forgotten that day have you
and here he laughed
i don't know as i be the father of the child she carried away with her from battersby but i very easily may have been
anyhow after i had left your papa's place a few days i wrote to ellen to an address we had agreed upon and told her i would do what i ought to do and so i did for i married her within a month afterwards
why lord love the man whatever is the matter with him
for as he had spoken the last few words of his story ernest had turned white as a sheet and was leaning against the railings
john said my hero gasping for breath are you sure of what you sayare you quite sure you really married her
of course i am said john i married her before the registrar at letchbury on the th of august 
give me your arm said ernest and take me into piccadilly and put me into a cab and come with me at once if you can spare time to mr overton's at the temple
chapter lxxvii   i do not think ernest himself was much more pleased at finding that he had never been married than i was
to him however the shock of pleasure was positively numbing in its intensity
as he felt his burden removed he reeled for the unaccustomed lightness of his movements his position was so shattered that his identity seemed to have been shattered also he was as one waking up from a horrible nightmare to find himself safe and sound in bed but who can hardly even yet believe that the room is not full of armed men who are about to spring upon him
and it is i he said who not an hour ago complained that i was without hope
it is i who for weeks have been railing at fortune and saying that though she smiled on others she never smiled at me
why never was anyone half so fortunate as i am
yes said i you have been inoculated for marriage and have recovered
and yet he said i was very fond of her till she took to drinking
perhaps but is it not tennyson who has said ''tis better to have loved and lost than never to have lost at all'
you are an inveterate bachelor was the rejoinder
then we had a long talk with john to whom i gave a  pound note upon the spot
he said ellen had used to drink at battersby the cook had taught her he had known it but was so fond of her that he had chanced it and married her to save her from the streets and in the hope of being able to keep her straight
she had done with him just as she had done with ernestmade him an excellent wife as long as she kept sober but a very bad one afterwards
there isn't said john a sweetertempered handier prettier girl than she was in all england nor one as knows better what a man likes and how to make him happy if you can keep her from drink but you can't keep her she's that artful she'll get it under your very eyes without you knowing it
if she can't get any more of your things to pawn or sell she'll steal her neighbours'
that's how she got into trouble first when i was with her
during the six months she was in prison i should have felt happy if i had not known she would come out again
and then she did come out and before she had been free a fortnight she began shoplifting and going on the loose againand all to get money to drink with
so seeing i could do nothing with her and that she was just akilling of me i left her and came up to london and went into service again and i did not know what had become of her till you and mr ernest here told me
i hope you'll neither of you say you've seen me
we assured him we would keep his counsel and then he left us with many protestations of affection towards ernest to whom he had been always much attached
we talked the situation over and decided first to get the children away and then to come to terms with ellen concerning their future custody as for herself i proposed that we should make her an allowance of say a pound a week to be paid so long as she gave no trouble
ernest did not see where the pound a week was to come from so i eased his mind by saying i would pay it myself
before the day was two hours older we had got the children about whom ellen had always appeared to be indifferent and had confided them to the care of my laundress a good motherly sort of woman who took to them and to whom they took at once
then came the odious task of getting rid of their unhappy mother
ernest's heart smote him at the notion of the shock the breakup would be to her
he was always thinking that people had a claim upon him for some inestimable service they had rendered him or for some irreparable mischief done to them by himself the case however was so clear that ernest's scruples did not offer serious resistance
i did not see why he should have the pain of another interview with his wife so i got mr ottery to manage the whole business
it turned out that we need not have harrowed ourselves so much about the agony of mind which ellen would suffer on becoming an outcast again
ernest saw mrs richards the neighbour who had called him down on the night when he had first discovered his wife's drunkenness and got from her some details of ellen's opinions upon the matter
she did not seem in the least consciencestricken she said thank goodness at last
and although aware that her marriage was not a valid one evidently regarded this as a mere detail which it would not be worth anybody's while to go into more particularly
as regards his breaking with her she said it was a good job both for him and for her
this life she continued don't suit me
ernest is too good for me he wants a woman as shall be a bit better than me and i want a man that shall be a bit worse than him
we should have got on all very well if we had not lived together as married folks but i've been used to have a little place of my own however small for a many years and i don't want ernest or any other man always hanging about it
besides he is too steady his being in prison hasn't done him a bit of goodhe's just as grave as those as have never been in prison at all and he never swears nor curses come what may it makes me afeared of him and therefore i drink the worse
what us poor girls wants is not to be jumped up all of a sudden and made honest women of this is too much for us and throws us off our perch what we wants is a regular friend or two who'll just keep us from starving and force us to be good for a bit together now and again
that's about as much as we can stand
he may have the children he can do better for them than i can and as for his money he may give it or keep it as he likes he's never done me any harm and i shall let him alone but if he means me to have it i suppose i'd better have it
and have it she did
and i thought ernest to himself again when the arrangement was concluded am the man who thought himself unlucky
i may as well say here all that need be said further about ellen
for the next three years she used to call regularly at mr ottery's every monday morning for her pound
she was always neatly dressed and looked so quiet and pretty that no one would have suspected her antecedents
at first she wanted sometimes to anticipate but after three or four ineffectual attemptson each of which occasions she told a most pitiful storyshe gave it up and took her money regularly without a word
once she came with a bad black eye which a boy had throwed a stone and hit her by mistake but on the whole she looked pretty much the same at the end of the three years as she had done at the beginning
then she explained that she was going to be married again
mr ottery saw her on this and pointed out to her that she would very likely be again committing bigamy by doing so
you may call it what you like she replied but i am going off to america with bill the butcher's man and we hope mr pontifex won't be too hard on us and stop the allowance
ernest was little likely to do this so the pair went in peace
i believe it was bill who had blacked her eye and she liked him all the better for it
from one or two little things i have been able to gather that the couple got on very well together and that in bill she has found a partner better suited to her than either john or ernest
on his birthday ernest generally receives an envelope with an american postmark containing a bookmarker with a flaunting text upon it or a moral kettleholder or some other similar small token of recognition but no letter
of the children she has taken no notice
chapter lxxviii   ernest was now well turned twentysix years old and in little more than another year and a half would come into possession of his money
i saw no reason for letting him have it earlier than the date fixed by miss pontifex herself at the same time i did not like his continuing the shop at blackfriars after the present crisis
it was not till now that i fully understood how much he had suffered nor how nearly his supposed wife's habits had brought him to actual want
i had indeed noted the old wan worn look settling upon his face but was either too indolent or too hopeless of being able to sustain a protracted and successful warfare with ellen to extend the sympathy and make the inquiries which i suppose i ought to have made
and yet i hardly know what i could have done for nothing short of his finding out what he had found out would have detached him from his wife and nothing could do him much good as long as he continued to live with her
after all i suppose i was right i suppose things did turn out all the better in the end for having been left to settle themselvesat any rate whether they did or did not the whole thing was in too great a muddle for me to venture to tackle it so long as ellen was upon the scene now however that she was removed all my interest in my godson revived and i turned over many times in my mind what i had better do with him
it was now three and a half years since he had come up to london and begun to live so to speak upon his own account
of these years six months had been spent as a clergyman six months in gaol and for two and a half years he had been acquiring twofold experience in the ways of business and of marriage
he had failed i may say in everything that he had undertaken even as a prisoner yet his defeats had been always as it seemed to me something so like victories that i was satisfied of his being worth all the pains i could bestow upon him my only fear was lest i should meddle with him when it might be better for him to be let alone
on the whole i concluded that a three and a half years' apprenticeship to a rough life was enough the shop had done much for him it had kept him going after a fashion when he was in great need it had thrown him upon his own resources and taught him to see profitable openings all around him where a few months before he would have seen nothing but insuperable difficulties it had enlarged his sympathies by making him understand the lower classes and not confining his view of life to that taken by gentlemen only
when he went about the streets and saw the books outside the secondhand bookstalls the bricabrac in the curiosity shops and the infinite commercial activity which is omnipresent around us he understood it and sympathised with it as he could never have done if he had not kept a shop himself
he has often told me that when he used to travel on a railway that overlooked populous suburbs and looked down upon street after street of dingy houses he used to wonder what kind of people lived in them what they did and felt and how far it was like what he did and felt himself
now he said he knew all about it
i am not very familiar with the writer of the odyssey who by the way i suspect strongly of having been a clergyman but he assuredly hit the right nail on the head when he epitomised his typical wise man as knowing the ways and farings of many men
what culture is comparable to this
what a lie what a sickly debilitating debauch did not ernest's school and university career now seem to him in comparison with his life in prison and as a tailor in blackfriars
i have heard him say he would have gone through all he had suffered if it were only for the deeper insight it gave him into the spirit of the grecian and the surrey pantomimes
what confidence again in his own power to swim if thrown into deep waters had not he won through his experiences during the last three years
but as i have said i thought my godson had now seen as much of the under currents of life as was likely to be of use to him and that it was time he began to live in a style more suitable to his prospects
his aunt had wished him to kiss the soil and he had kissed it with a vengeance but i did not like the notion of his coming suddenly from the position of a small shopkeeper to that of a man with an income of between three and four thousand a year
too sudden a jump from bad fortune to good is just as dangerous as one from good to bad besides poverty is very wearing it is a quasiembryonic condition through which a man had better pass if he is to hold his later developments securely but like measles or scarlet fever he had better have it mildly and get it over early
no man is safe from losing every penny he has in the world unless he has had his facer
how often do i not hear middleaged women and quiet family men say that they have no speculative tendency they never had touched and never would touch any but the very soundest best reputed investments and as for unlimited liability oh dear
dear
and they throw up their hands and eyes
whenever a person is heard to talk thus he may be recognised as the easy prey of the first adventurer who comes across him he will commonly indeed wind up his discourse by saying that in spite of all his natural caution and his well knowing how foolish speculation is yet there are some investments which are called speculative but in reality are not so and he will pull out of his pocket the prospectus of a cornish gold mine
it is only on having actually lost money that one realises what an awful thing the loss of it is and finds out how easily it is lost by those who venture out of the middle of the most beaten path
ernest had had his facer as he had had his attack of poverty young and sufficiently badly for a sensible man to be little likely to forget it
i can fancy few pieces of good fortune greater than this as happening to any man provided of course that he is not damaged irretrievably
so strongly do i feel on this subject that if i had my way i would have a speculation master attached to every school
the boys would be encouraged to read the money market review the railway news and all the best financial papers and should establish a stock exchange amongst themselves in which pence should stand as pounds
then let them see how this making haste to get rich moneys out in actual practice
there might be a prize awarded by the headmaster to the most prudent dealer and the boys who lost their money time after time should be dismissed
of course if any boy proved to have a genius for speculation and made moneywell and good let him speculate by all means
if universities were not the worst teachers in the world i should like to see professorships of speculation established at oxford and cambridge
when i reflect however that the only things worth doing which oxford and cambridge can do well are cooking cricket rowing and games of which there is no professorship i fear that the establishment of a professorial chair would end in teaching young men neither how to speculate nor how not to speculate but would simply turn them out as bad speculators
i heard of one case in which a father actually carried my idea into practice
he wanted his son to learn how little confidence was to be placed in glowing prospectuses and flaming articles and found him five hundred pounds which he was to invest according to his lights
the father expected he would lose the money but it did not turn out so in practice for the boy took so much pains and played so cautiously that the money kept growing and growing till the father took it away again increment and allas he was pleased to say in self defence
i had made my own mistakes with money about the year  when everyone else was making them
for a few years i had been so scared and had suffered so severely that when owing to the good advice of the broker who had advised my father and grandfather before me i came out in the end a winner and not a loser i played no more pranks but kept henceforward as nearly in the middle of the middle rut as i could
i tried in fact to keep my money rather than to make more of it
i had done with ernest's money as with my ownthat is to say i had let it alone after investing it in midland ordinary stock according to miss pontifex's instructions
no amount of trouble would have been likely to have increased my godson's estate one half so much as it had increased without my taking any trouble at all
midland stock at the end of august  when i sold out miss pontifex's debentures stood at  pounds per  pounds
i invested the whole of ernest's  pounds at this price and did not change the investment till a few months before the time of which i have been writing latelythat is to say until september 
i then sold at  pounds per share and invested in london and northwestern ordinary stock which i was advised was more likely to rise than midlands now were
i bought the london and northwestern stock at  pounds per  pounds and my godson now in  still holds it
the original  pounds had increased in eleven years to over  pounds the accumulated interest which of course i had reinvested had come to about  pounds more so that ernest was then worth over  pounds
at present he is worth nearly double that sum and all as the result of leaving well alone
large as his property now was it ought to be increased still further during the year and a half that remained of his minority so that on coming of age he ought to have an income of at least  pounds a year
i wished him to understand bookkeeping by double entry
i had myself as a young man been compelled to master this not very difficult art having acquired it i have become enamoured of it and consider it the most necessary branch of any young man's education after reading and writing
i was determined therefore that ernest should master it and proposed that he should become my steward bookkeeper and the manager of my hoardings for so i called the sum which my ledger showed to have accumulated from  to  pounds
i told him i was going to begin to spend the income as soon as it had amounted up to  pounds
a few days after ernest's discovery that he was still a bachelor while he was still at the very beginning of the honeymoon as it were of his renewed unmarried life i broached my scheme desired him to give up his shop and offered him  pounds a year for managing so far indeed as it required any managing his own property
this  pounds a year i need hardly say i made him charge to the estate
if anything had been wanting to complete his happiness it was this
here within three or four days he found himself freed from one of the most hideous hopeless liaisons imaginable and at the same time raised from a life of almost squalor to the enjoyment of what would to him be a handsome income
a pound a week he thought for ellen and the rest for myself
no said i we will charge ellen's pound a week to the estate also
you must have a clear  pounds for yourself
i fixed upon this sum because it was the one which mr disraeli gave coningsby when coningsby was at the lowest ebb of his fortunes
mr disraeli evidently thought  pounds a year the smallest sum on which coningsby could be expected to live and make the two ends meet with this however he thought his hero could manage to get along for a year or two
in  of which i am now writing prices had risen though not so much as they have since done on the other hand ernest had had less expensive antecedents than coningsby so on the whole i thought  pounds a year would be about the right thing for him
chapter lxxix   the question now arose what was to be done with the children
i explained to ernest that their expenses must be charged to the estate and showed him how small a hole all the various items i proposed to charge would make in the income at my disposal
he was beginning to make difficulties when i quieted him by pointing out that the money had all come to me from his aunt over his own head and reminded him there had been an understanding between her and me that i should do much as i was doing if occasion should arise
he wanted his children to be brought up in the fresh pure air and among other children who were happy and contented but being still ignorant of the fortune that awaited him he insisted that they should pass their earlier years among the poor rather than the rich
i remonstrated but he was very decided about it and when i reflected that they were illegitimate i was not sure but that what ernest proposed might be as well for everyone in the end
they were still so young that it did not much matter where they were so long as they were with kindly decent people and in a healthy neighbourhood
i shall be just as unkind to my children he said as my grandfather was to my father or my father to me
if they did not succeed in making their children love them neither shall i  i say to myself that i should like to do so but so did they
i can make sure that they shall not know how much they would have hated me if they had had much to do with me but this is all i can do
if i must ruin their prospects let me do so at a reasonable time before they are old enough to feel it
he mused a little and added with a laugh  a man first quarrels with his father about threequarters of a year before he is born
it is then he insists on setting up a separate establishment when this has been once agreed to the more complete the separation for ever after the better for both
then he said more seriously i want to put the children where they will be well and happy and where they will not be betrayed into the misery of false expectations
in the end he remembered that on his sunday walks he had more than once seen a couple who lived on the waterside a few miles below gravesend just where the sea was beginning and who he thought would do
they had a family of their own fast coming on and the children seemed to thrive both father and mother indeed were comfortable well grown folks in whose hands young people would be likely to have as fair a chance of coming to a good development as in those of any whom he knew
we went down to see this couple and as i thought no less well of them than ernest did we offered them a pound a week to take the children and bring them up as though they were their own
they jumped at the offer and in another day or two we brought the children down and left them feeling that we had done as well as we could by them at any rate for the present
then ernest sent his small stock of goods to debenham's gave up the house he had taken two and a half years previously and returned to civilisation
i had expected that he would now rapidly recover and was disappointed to see him get as i thought decidedly worse
indeed before long i thought him looking so ill that i insisted on his going with me to consult one of the most eminent doctors in london
this gentleman said there was no acute disease but that my young friend was suffering from nervous prostration the result of long and severe mental suffering from which there was no remedy except time prosperity and rest
he said that ernest must have broken down later on but that he might have gone on for some months yet
it was the suddenness of the relief from tension which had knocked him over now
cross him said the doctor at once
crossing is the great medical discovery of the age
shake him out of himself by shaking something else into him
i had not told him that money was no object to us and i think he had reckoned me up as not over rich
he continued  seeing is a mode of touching touching is a mode of feeding feeding is a mode of assimilation assimilation is a mode of recreation and reproduction and this is crossingshaking yourself into something else and something else into you
he spoke laughingly but it was plain he was serious
he continued  people are always coming to me who want crossing or change if you prefer it and who i know have not money enough to let them get away from london
this has set me thinking how i can best cross them even if they cannot leave home and i have made a list of cheap london amusements which i recommend to my patients none of them cost more than a few shillings or take more than half a day or a day
i explained that there was no occasion to consider money in this case
i am glad of it he said still laughing
the homoeopathists use aurum as a medicine but they do not give it in large doses enough if you can dose your young friend with this pretty freely you will soon bring him round
however mr pontifex is not well enough to stand so great a change as going abroad yet from what you tell me i should think he had had as much change lately as is good for him
if he were to go abroad now he would probably be taken seriously ill within a week
we must wait till he has recovered tone a little more
i will begin by ringing my london changes on him
he thought a little and then said  i have found the zoological gardens of service to many of my patients
i should prescribe for mr pontifex a course of the larger mammals
don't let him think he is taking them medicinally but let him go to their house twice a week for a fortnight and stay with the hippopotamus the rhinoceros and the elephants till they begin to bore him
i find these beasts do my patients more good than any others
the monkeys are not a wide enough cross they do not stimulate sufficiently
the larger carnivora are unsympathetic
the reptiles are worse than useless and the marsupials are not much better
birds again except parrots are not very beneficial he may look at them now and again but with the elephants and the pig tribe generally he should mix just now as freely as possible
then you know to prevent monotony i should send him say to morning service at the abbey before he goes
he need not stay longer than the te deum
i don't know why but jubilates are seldom satisfactory
just let him look in at the abbey and sit quietly in poets' corner till the main part of the music is over
let him do this two or three times not more before he goes to the zoo
then next day send him down to gravesend by boat
by all means let him go to the theatres in the eveningsand then let him come to me again in a fortnight
had the doctor been less eminent in his profession i should have doubted whether he was in earnest but i knew him to be a man of business who would neither waste his own time nor that of his patients
as soon as we were out of the house we took a cab to regent's park and spent a couple of hours in sauntering round the different houses
perhaps it was on account of what the doctor had told me but i certainly became aware of a feeling i had never experienced before
i mean that i was receiving an influx of new life or deriving new ways of looking at lifewhich is the same thingby the process
i found the doctor quite right in his estimate of the larger mammals as the ones which on the whole were most beneficial and observed that ernest who had heard nothing of what the doctor had said to me lingered instinctively in front of them
as for the elephants especially the baby elephant he seemed to be drinking in large draughts of their lives to the recreation and regeneration of his own
we dined in the gardens and i noticed with pleasure that ernest's appetite was already improved
since this time whenever i have been a little out of sorts myself i have at once gone up to regent's park and have invariably been benefited
i mention this here in the hope that some one or other of my readers may find the hint a useful one
at the end of his fortnight my hero was much better more so even than our friend the doctor had expected
now he said mr pontifex may go abroad and the sooner the better
let him stay a couple of months
this was the first ernest had heard about his going abroad and he talked about my not being able to spare him for so long
i soon made this all right
it is now the beginning of april said i go down to marseilles at once and take steamer to nice
then saunter down the riviera to genoafrom genoa go to florence rome and naples and come home by way of venice and the italian lakes
and won't you come too
said he eagerly
i said i did not mind if i did so we began to make our arrangements next morning and completed them within a very few days
chapter lxxx   we left by the night mail crossing from dover
the night was soft and there was a bright moon upon the sea
don't you love the smell of grease about the engine of a channel steamer
isn't there a lot of hope in it
said ernest to me for he had been to normandy one summer as a boy with his father and mother and the smell carried him back to days before those in which he had begun to bruise himself against the great outside world
i always think one of the best parts of going abroad is the first thud of the piston and the first gurgling of the water when the paddle begins to strike it
it was very dreamy getting out at calais and trudging about with luggage in a foreign town at an hour when we were generally both of us in bed and fast asleep but we settled down to sleep as soon as we got into the railway carriage and dozed till we had passed amiens
then waking when the first signs of morning crispness were beginning to show themselves i saw that ernest was already devouring every object we passed with quick sympathetic curiousness
there was not a peasant in a blouse driving his cart betimes along the road to market not a signalman's wife in her husband's hat and coat waving a green flag not a shepherd taking out his sheep to the dewy pastures not a bank of opening cowslips as we passed through the railway cuttings but he was drinking it all in with an enjoyment too deep for words
the name of the engine that drew us was mozart and ernest liked this too
we reached paris by six and had just time to get across the town and take a morning express train to marseilles but before noon my young friend was tired out and had resigned himself to a series of sleeps which were seldom intermitted for more than an hour or so together
he fought against this for a time but in the end consoled himself by saying it was so nice to have so much pleasure that he could afford to throw a lot of it away
having found a theory on which to justify himself he slept in peace
at marseilles we rested and there the excitement of the change proved as i had half feared it would too much for my godson's still enfeebled state
for a few days he was really ill but after this he righted
for my own part i reckon being ill as one of the great pleasures of life provided one is not too ill and is not obliged to work till one is better
i remember being ill once in a foreign hotel myself and how much i enjoyed it
to lie there careless of everything quiet and warm and with no weight upon the mind to hear the clinking of the plates in the faroff kitchen as the scullion rinsed them and put them by to watch the soft shadows come and go upon the ceiling as the sun came out or went behind a cloud to listen to the pleasant murmuring of the fountain in the court below and the shaking of the bells on the horses' collars and the clink of their hoofs upon the ground as the flies plagued them not only to be a lotuseater but to know that it was one's duty to be a lotus eater
oh i thought to myself if i could only now having so forgotten care drop off to sleep for ever would not this be a better piece of fortune than any i can ever hope for
of course it would but we would not take it though it were offered us
no matter what evil may befall us we will mostly abide by it and see it out
i could see that ernest felt much as i had felt myself
he said little but noted everything
once only did he frighten me
he called me to his bedside just as it was getting dusk and said in a grave quiet manner that he should like to speak to me
i have been thinking he said that i may perhaps never recover from this illness and in case i do not i should like you to know that there is only one thing which weighs upon me
i refer he continued after a slight pause to my conduct towards my father and mother
i have been much too good to them
i treated them much too considerately on which he broke into a smile which assured me that there was nothing seriously amiss with him
on the walls of his bedroom were a series of french revolution prints representing events in the life of lycurgus
there was grandeur d'ame de lycurgue and lycurgue consulte l'oracle and then there was calciope a la cour
under this was written in french and spanish modele de grace et de beaute la jeune calciope non moins sage que belle avait merite l'estime et l'attachement du vertueux lycurgue
vivement epris de tant de charmes l'illustre philosophe la conduisait dans le temple de junon ou ils s'unirent par un serment sacre
apres cette auguste ceremonie lycurgue s'empressa de conduire sa jeune epouse au palais de son frere polydecte roi de lacedemon
seigneur lui ditil la vertueuse calciope vient de recevoir mes voeux aux pieds des autels j'ose vous prier d'approuver cette union
le roi temoigna d'abord quelque surprise mais l'estime qu'il avait pour son frere lui inspira une reponse pleine de beinveillance
il s'approcha aussitot de calciope qu'il embrassa tendrement combla ensuite lycurgue de prevenances et parut tres satisfait
he called my attention to this and then said somewhat timidly that he would rather have married ellen than calciope
i saw he was hardening and made no hesitation about proposing that in another day or two we should proceed upon our journey
i will not weary the reader by taking him with us over beaten ground
we stopped at siena cortona orvieto perugia and many other cities and then after a fortnight passed between rome and naples went to the venetian provinces and visited all those wondrous towns that lie between the southern slopes of the alps and the northern ones of the apennines coming back at last by the s gothard
i doubt whether he had enjoyed the trip more than i did myself but it was not till we were on the point of returning that ernest had recovered strength enough to be called fairly well and it was not for many months that he so completely lost all sense of the wounds which the last four years had inflicted on him as to feel as though there were a scar and a scar only remaining
they say that when people have lost an arm or a foot they feel pains in it now and again for a long while after they have lost it
one pain which he had almost forgotten came upon him on his return to england i mean the sting of his having been imprisoned
as long as he was only a small shopkeeper his imprisonment mattered nothing nobody knew of it and if they had known they would not have cared now however though he was returning to his old position he was returning to it disgraced and the pain from which he had been saved in the first instance by surroundings so new that he had hardly recognised his own identity in the middle of them came on him as from a wound inflicted yesterday
he thought of the high resolves which he had made in prison about using his disgrace as a vantage ground of strength rather than trying to make people forget it
that was all very well then he thought to himself when the grapes were beyond my reach but now it is different
besides who but a prig would set himself high aims or make high resolves at all
some of his old friends on learning that he had got rid of his supposed wife and was now comfortably off again wanted to renew their acquaintance he was grateful to them and sometimes tried to meet their advances half way but it did not do and ere long he shrank back into himself pretending not to know them
an infernal demon of honesty haunted him which made him say to himself these men know a great deal but do not know allif they did they would cut meand therefore i have no right to their acquaintance
he thought that everyone except himself was sans peur et sans reproche
of course they must be for if they had not been would they not have been bound to warn all who had anything to do with them of their deficiencies
well he could not do this and he would not have people's acquaintance under false pretences so he gave up even hankering after rehabilitation and fell back upon his old tastes for music and literature
of course he has long since found out how silly all this was how silly i mean in theory for in practice it worked better than it ought to have done by keeping him free from liaisons which would have tied his tongue and made him see success elsewhere than where he came in time to see it
he did what he did instinctively and for no other reason than because it was most natural to him
so far as he thought at all he thought wrong but what he did was right
i said something of this kind to him once not so very long ago and told him he had always aimed high
i never aimed at all he replied a little indignantly and you may be sure i should have aimed low enough if i had thought i had got the chance
i suppose after all that no one whose mind was not to put it mildly abnormal ever yet aimed very high out of pure malice aforethought
i once saw a fly alight on a cup of hot coffee on which the milk had formed a thin skin he perceived his extreme danger and i noted with what ample strides and almost supermuscan effort he struck across the treacherous surface and made for the edge of the cupfor the ground was not solid enough to let him raise himself from it by his wings
as i watched him i fancied that so supreme a moment of difficulty and danger might leave him with an increase of moral and physical power which might even descend in some measure to his offspring
but surely he would not have got the increased moral power if he could have helped it and he will not knowingly alight upon another cup of hot coffee
the more i see the more sure i am that it does not matter why people do the right thing so long only as they do it nor why they may have done the wrong if they have done it
the result depends upon the thing done and the motive goes for nothing
i have read somewhere but cannot remember where that in some country district there was once a great scarcity of food during which the poor suffered acutely many indeed actually died of starvation and all were hard put to it
in one village however there was a poor widow with a family of young children who though she had small visible means of subsistence still looked wellfed and comfortable as also did all her little ones
how everyone asked did they manage to live
it was plain they had a secret and it was equally plain that it could be no good one for there came a hurried hunted look over the poor woman's face if anyone alluded to the way in which she and hers throve when others starved the family moreover were sometimes seen out at unusual hours of the night and evidently brought things home which could hardly have been honestly come by
they knew they were under suspicion and being hitherto of excellent name it made them very unhappy for it must be confessed that they believed what they did to be uncanny if not absolutely wicked nevertheless in spite of this they throve and kept their strength when all their neighbours were pinched
at length matters came to a head and the clergyman of the parish cross questioned the poor woman so closely that with many tears and a bitter sense of degradation she confessed the truth she and her children went into the hedges and gathered snails which they made into broth and atecould she ever be forgiven
was there any hope of salvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural conduct
so again i have heard of an old dowager countess whose money was all in consols she had had many sons and in her anxiety to give the younger ones a good start wanted a larger income than consols would give her
she consulted her solicitor and was advised to sell her consols and invest in the london and northwestern railway then at about 
this was to her what eating snails was to the poor widow whose story i have told above
with shame and grief as of one doing an unclean thingbut her boys must have their startshe did as she was advised
then for a long while she could not sleep at night and was haunted by a presage of disaster
yet what happened
she started her boys and in a few years found her capital doubled into the bargain on which she sold out and went back again to consols and died in the full blessedness of fundholding
she thought indeed that she was doing a wrong and dangerous thing but this had absolutely nothing to do with it
suppose she had invested in the full confidence of a recommendation by some eminent london banker whose advice was bad and so had lost all her money and suppose she had done this with a light heart and with no conviction of sinwould her innocence of evil purpose and the excellence of her motive have stood her in any stead
not they
but to return to my story
towneley gave my hero most trouble
towneley as i have said knew that ernest would have money soon but ernest did not of course know that he knew it
towneley was rich himself and was married now ernest would be rich soon had bona fide intended to be married already and would doubtless marry a lawful wife later on
such a man was worth taking pains with and when towneley one day met ernest in the street and ernest tried to avoid him towneley would not have it but with his usual quick good nature read his thoughts caught him morally speaking by the scruff of his neck and turned him laughingly inside out telling him he would have no such nonsense
towneley was just as much ernest's idol now as he had ever been and ernest who was very easily touched felt more gratefully and warmly than ever towards him but there was an unconscious something which was stronger than towneley and made my hero determine to break with him more determinedly perhaps than with any other living person he thanked him in a low hurried voice and pressed his hand while tears came into his eyes in spite of all his efforts to repress them
if we meet again he said do not look at me but if hereafter you hear of me writing things you do not like think of me as charitably as you can and so they parted
towneley is a good fellow said i gravely and you should not have cut him
towneley he answered is not only a good fellow but he is without exception the very best man i ever saw in my lifeexcept he paid me the compliment of saying yourself towneley is my notion of everything which i should most like to bebut there is no real solidarity between us
i should be in perpetual fear of losing his good opinion if i said things he did not like and i mean to say a great many things he continued more merrily which towneley will not like
a man as i have said already can give up father and mother for christ's sake tolerably easily for the most part but it is not so easy to give up people like towneley
chapter lxxxi   so he fell away from all old friends except myself and three or four old intimates of my own who were as sure to take to him as he to them and who like myself enjoyed getting hold of a young fresh mind
ernest attended to the keeping of my account books whenever there was anything which could possibly be attended to which there seldom was and spent the greater part of the rest of his time in adding to the many notes and tentative essays which had already accumulated in his portfolios
anyone who was used to writing could see at a glance that literature was his natural development and i was pleased at seeing him settle down to it so spontaneously
i was less pleased however to observe that he would still occupy himself with none but the most serious i had almost said solemn subjects just as he never cared about any but the most serious kind of music
i said to him one day that the very slender reward which god had attached to the pursuit of serious inquiry was a sufficient proof that he disapproved of it or at any rate that he did not set much store by it nor wish to encourage it
he said oh don't talk about rewards
look at milton who only got  pounds for 'paradise lost'
and a great deal too much i rejoined promptly
i would have given him twice as much myself not to have written it at all
ernest was a little shocked
at any rate he said laughingly i don't write poetry
this was a cut at me for my burlesques were of course written in rhyme
so i dropped the matter
after a time he took it into his head to reopen the question of his getting  pounds a year for doing as he said absolutely nothing and said he would try to find some employment which should bring him in enough to live upon
i laughed at this but let him alone
he tried and tried very hard for a long while but i need hardly say was unsuccessful
the older i grow the more convinced i become of the folly and credulity of the public but at the same time the harder do i see it is to impose oneself upon that folly and credulity
he tried editor after editor with article after article
sometimes an editor listened to him and told him to leave his articles he almost invariably however had them returned to him in the end with a polite note saying that they were not suited for the particular paper to which he had sent them
and yet many of these very articles appeared in his later works and no one complained of them not at least on the score of bad literary workmanship
i see he said to me one day that demand is very imperious and supply must be very suppliant
once indeed the editor of an important monthly magazine accepted an article from him and he thought he had now got a footing in the literary world
the article was to appear in the next issue but one and he was to receive proof from the printers in about ten days or a fortnight but week after week passed and there was no proof month after month went by and there was still no room for ernest's article at length after about six months the editor one morning told him that he had filled every number of his review for the next ten months but that his article should definitely appear
on this he insisted on having his ms returned to him
sometimes his articles were actually published and he found the editor had edited them according to his own fancy putting in jokes which he thought were funny or cutting out the very passage which ernest had considered the point of the whole thing and then though the articles appeared when it came to paying for them it was another matter and he never saw his money
editors he said to me one day about this time are like the people who bought and sold in the book of revelation there is not one but has the mark of the beast upon him
at last after months of disappointment and many a tedious hour wasted in dingy anterooms and of all anterooms those of editors appear to me to be the dreariest he got a bona fide offer of employment from one of the first class weekly papers through an introduction i was able to get for him from one who had powerful influence with the paper in question
the editor sent him a dozen long books upon varied and difficult subjects and told him to review them in a single article within a week
in one book there was an editorial note to the effect that the writer was to be condemned
ernest particularly admired the book he was desired to condemn and feeling how hopeless it was for him to do anything like justice to the books submitted to him returned them to the editor
at last one paper did actually take a dozen or so of articles from him and gave him cash down a couple of guineas apiece for them but having done this it expired within a fortnight after the last of ernest's articles had appeared
it certainly looked very much as if the other editors knew their business in declining to have anything to do with my unlucky godson
i was not sorry that he failed with periodical literature for writing for reviews or newspapers is bad training for one who may aspire to write works of more permanent interest
a young writer should have more time for reflection than he can get as a contributor to the daily or even weekly press
ernest himself however was chagrined at finding how unmarketable he was
why he said to me if i was a wellbred horse or sheep or a purebred pigeon or lopeared rabbit i should be more saleable
if i was even a cathedral in a colonial town people would give me something but as it is they do not want me and now that he was well and rested he wanted to set up a shop again but this of course i would not hear of
what care i said he to me one day about being what they call a gentleman
and his manner was almost fierce
what has being a gentleman ever done for me except make me less able to prey and more easy to be preyed upon
it has changed the manner of my being swindled that is all
but for your kindness to me i should be penniless
thank heaven i have placed my children where i have
i begged him to keep quiet a little longer and not talk about taking a shop
will being a gentleman he said bring me money at the last and will anything bring me as much peace at the last as money will
they say that those who have riches enter hardly into the kingdom of heaven
by jove they do they are like struldbrugs they live and live and live and are happy for many a long year after they would have entered into the kingdom of heaven if they had been poor
i want to live long and to raise my children if i see they would be happier for the raising that is what i want and it is not what i am doing now that will help me
being a gentleman is a luxury which i cannot afford therefore i do not want it
let me go back to my shop again and do things for people which they want done and will pay me for doing for them
they know what they want and what is good for them better than i can tell them
it was hard to deny the soundness of this and if he had been dependent only on the  pounds a year which he was getting from me i should have advised him to open his shop again next morning
as it was i temporised and raised obstacles and quieted him from time to time as best i could
of course he read mr darwin's books as fast as they came out and adopted evolution as an article of faith
it seems to me he said once that i am like one of those caterpillars which if they have been interrupted in making their hammock must begin again from the beginning
so long as i went back a long way down in the social scale i got on all right and should have made money but for ellen when i try to take up the work at a higher stage i fail completely
i do not know whether the analogy holds good or not but i am sure ernest's instinct was right in telling him that after a heavy fall he had better begin life again at a very low stage and as i have just said i would have let him go back to his shop if i had not known what i did
as the time fixed upon by his aunt drew nearer i prepared him more and more for what was coming and at last on his twentyeighth birthday i was able to tell him all and to show him the letter signed by his aunt upon her deathbed to the effect that i was to hold the money in trust for him
his birthday happened that year  to be on a sunday but on the following day i transferred his shares into his own name and presented him with the account books which he had been keeping for the last year and a half
in spite of all that i had done to prepare him it was a long while before i could get him actually to believe that the money was his own
he did not say muchno more did i for i am not sure that i did not feel as much moved at having brought my long trusteeship to a satisfactory conclusion as ernest did at finding himself owner of more than  pounds
when he did speak it was to jerk out a sentence or two of reflection at a time
if i were rendering this moment in music he said i should allow myself free use of the augmented sixth
a little later i remember his saying with a laugh that had something of a family likeness to his aunt's it is not the pleasure it causes me which i enjoy so it is the pain it will cause to all my friends except yourself and towneley
i said you cannot tell your father and motherit would drive them mad
no no no said he it would be too cruel it would be like isaac offering up abraham and no thicket with a ram in it near at hand
besides why should i
we have cut each other these four years
chapter lxxxii   it almost seemed as though our casual mention of theobald and christina had in some way excited them from a dormant to an active state
during the years that had elapsed since they last appeared upon the scene they had remained at battersby and had concentrated their affection upon their other children
it had been a bitter pill to theobald to lose his power of plaguing his firstborn if the truth were known i believe he had felt this more acutely than any disgrace which might have been shed upon him by ernest's imprisonment
he had made one or two attempts to reopen negotiations through me but i never said anything about them to ernest for i knew it would upset him
i wrote however to theobald that i had found his son inexorable and recommended him for the present at any rate to desist from returning to the subject
this i thought would be at once what ernest would like best and theobald least
a few days however after ernest had come into his property i received a letter from theobald enclosing one for ernest which i could not withhold
the letter ran thus     to my son ernestalthough you have more than once rejected my    overtures i appeal yet again to your better nature
your mother who    has long been ailing is i believe near her end she is unable to    keep anything on her stomach and dr martin holds out but little hopes    of her recovery
she has expressed a wish to see you and says she    knows you will not refuse to come to her which considering her    condition i am unwilling to suppose you will
i remit you a post office order for your fare and will pay your    return journey
if you want clothes to come in order what you consider suitable and    desire that the bill be sent to me i will pay it immediately to an    amount not exceeding eight or nine pounds and if you will let me know    what train you will come by i will send the carriage to meet you
believe me your affectionate father t
pontifex
of course there could be no hesitation on ernest's part
he could afford to smile now at his father's offering to pay for his clothes and his sending him a post office order for the exact price of a secondclass ticket and he was of course shocked at learning the state his mother was said to be in and touched at her desire to see him
he telegraphed that he would come down at once
i saw him a little before he started and was pleased to see how well his tailor had done by him
towneley himself could not have been appointed more becomingly
his portmanteau his railway wrapper everything he had about him was in keeping
i thought he had grown much betterlooking than he had been at two or three and twenty
his year and a half of peace had effaced all the ill effects of his previous suffering and now that he had become actually rich there was an air of insouciance and good humour upon his face as of a man with whom everything was going perfectly right which would have made a much plainer man goodlooking
i was proud of him and delighted with him
i am sure i said to myself that whatever else he may do he will never marry again
the journey was a painful one
as he drew near to the station and caught sight of each familiar feature so strong was the force of association that he felt as though his coming into his aunt's money had been a dream and he were again returning to his father's house as he had returned to it from cambridge for the vacations
do what he would the old dull weight of homesickness began to oppress him his heart beat fast as he thought of his approaching meeting with his father and mother and i shall have he said to himself to kiss charlotte
would his father meet him at the station
would he greet him as though nothing had happened or would he be cold and distant
how again would he take the news of his son's good fortune
as the train drew up to the platform ernest's eye ran hurriedly over the few people who were in the station
his father's wellknown form was not among them but on the other side of the palings which divided the station yard from the platform he saw the pony carriage looking as he thought rather shabby and recognised his father's coachman
in a few minutes more he was in the carriage driving towards battersby
he could not help smiling as he saw the coachman give a look of surprise at finding him so much changed in personal appearance
the coachman was the more surprised because when ernest had last been at home he had been dressed as a clergyman and now he was not only a layman but a layman who was got up regardless of expense
the change was so great that it was not till ernest actually spoke to him that the coachman knew him
how are my father and mother
he asked hurriedly as he got into the carriage
the master's well sir was the answer but the missis is very sadly
the horse knew that he was going home and pulled hard at the reins
the weather was cold and rawthe very ideal of a november day in one part of the road the floods were out and near here they had to pass through a number of horsemen and dogs for the hounds had met that morning at a place near battersby
ernest saw several people whom he knew but they either as is most likely did not recognise him or did not know of his good luck
when battersby church tower drew near and he saw the rectory on the top of the hill its chimneys just showing above the leafless trees with which it was surrounded he threw himself back in the carriage and covered his face with his hands
it came to an end as even the worst quarters of an hour do and in a few minutes more he was on the steps in front of his father's house
his father hearing the carriage arrive came a little way down the steps to meet him
like the coachman he saw at a glance that ernest was appointed as though money were abundant with him and that he was looking robust and full of health and vigour
this was not what he had bargained for
he wanted ernest to return but he was to return as any respectable wellregulated prodigal ought to returnabject brokenhearted asking forgiveness from the tenderest and most longsuffering father in the whole world
if he should have shoes and stockings and whole clothes at all it should be only because absolute rags and tatters had been graciously dispensed with whereas here he was swaggering in a grey ulster and a blue and white necktie and looking better than theobald had ever seen him in his life
it was unprincipled
was it for this that he had been generous enough to offer to provide ernest with decent clothes in which to come and visit his mother's deathbed
could any advantage be meaner than the one which ernest had taken
well he would not go a penny beyond the eight or nine pounds which he had promised
it was fortunate he had given a limit
why he theobald had never been able to afford such a portmanteau in his life
he was still using an old one which his father had turned over to him when he went up to cambridge
besides he had said clothes not a portmanteau
ernest saw what was passing through his father's mind and felt that he ought to have prepared him in some way for what he now saw but he had sent his telegram so immediately on receiving his father's letter and had followed it so promptly that it would not have been easy to do so even if he had thought of it
he put out his hand and said laughingly oh it's all paid fori am afraid you do not know that mr overton has handed over to me aunt alethea's money
theobald flushed scarlet
but why he said and these were the first words that actually crossed his lipsif the money was not his to keep did he not hand it over to my brother john and me
he stammered a good deal and looked sheepish but he got the words out
because my dear father said ernest still laughing my aunt left it to him in trust for me not in trust either for you or for my uncle johnand it has accumulated till it is now over  pounds
but tell me how is my mother
no ernest said theobald excitedly the matter cannot rest here i must know that this is all open and above board
this had the true theobald ring and instantly brought the whole train of ideas which in ernest's mind were connected with his father
the surroundings were the old familiar ones but the surrounded were changed almost beyond power of recognition
he turned sharply on theobald in a moment
i will not repeat the words he used for they came out before he had time to consider them and they might strike some of my readers as disrespectful there were not many of them but they were effectual
theobald said nothing but turned almost of an ashen colour he never again spoke to his son in such a way as to make it necessary for him to repeat what he had said on this occasion
ernest quickly recovered his temper and again asked after his mother
theobald was glad enough to take this opening now and replied at once in the tone he would have assumed towards one he most particularly desired to conciliate that she was getting rapidly worse in spite of all he had been able to do for her and concluded by saying she had been the comfort and mainstay of his life for more than thirty years but that he could not wish it prolonged
the pair then went upstairs to christina's room the one in which ernest had been born
his father went before him and prepared her for her son's approach
the poor woman raised herself in bed as he came towards her and weeping as she flung her arms around him cried oh i knew he would come i knew i knew he could come
ernest broke down and wept as he had not done for years
oh my boy my boy she said as soon as she could recover her voice
have you never really been near us for all these years
ah you do not know how we have loved you and mourned over you papa just as much as i have
you know he shows his feelings less but i can never tell you how very very deeply he has felt for you
sometimes at night i have thought i have heard footsteps in the garden and have got quietly out of bed lest i should wake him and gone to the window to look out but there has been only dark or the greyness of the morning and i have gone crying back to bed again
still i think you have been near us though you were too proud to let us knowand now at last i have you in my arms once more my dearest dearest boy
how cruel how infamously unfeeling ernest thought he had been
mother he said forgive methe fault was mine i ought not to have been so hard i was wrong very wrong the poor blubbering fellow meant what he said and his heart yearned to his mother as he had never thought that it could yearn again
but have you never she continued come although it was in the dark and we did not know itoh let me think that you have not been so cruel as we have thought you
tell me that you came if only to comfort me and make me happier
ernest was ready
i had no money to come with mother till just lately
this was an excuse christina could understand and make allowance for oh then you would have come and i will take the will for the deedand now that i have you safe again say that you will never never leave menot tillnot tilloh my boy have they told you i am dying
she wept bitterly and buried her head in her pillow
chapter lxxxiii   joey and charlotte were in the room
joey was now ordained and was curate to theobald
he and ernest had never been sympathetic and ernest saw at a glance that there was no chance of a rapprochement between them
he was a little startled at seeing joey dressed as a clergyman and looking so like what he had looked himself a few years earlier for there was a good deal of family likeness between the pair but joey's face was cold and was illumined with no spark of bohemianism he was a clergyman and was going to do as other clergymen did neither better nor worse
he greeted ernest rather de haut en bas that is to say he began by trying to do so but the affair tailed off unsatisfactorily
his sister presented her cheek to him to be kissed
how he hated it he had been dreading it for the last three hours
she too was distant and reproachful in her manner as such a superior person was sure to be
she had a grievance against him inasmuch as she was still unmarried
she laid the blame of this at ernest's door it was his misconduct she maintained in secret which had prevented young men from making offers to her and she ran him up a heavy bill for consequential damages
she and joey had from the first developed an instinct for hunting with the hounds and now these two had fairly identified themselves with the older generationthat is to say as against ernest
on this head there was an offensive and defensive alliance between them but between themselves there was subdued but internecine warfare
this at least was what ernest gathered partly from his recollections of the parties concerned and partly from his observation of their little ways during the first halfhour after his arrival while they were all together in his mother's bedroomfor as yet of course they did not know that he had money
he could see that they eyed him from time to time with a surprise not unmixed with indignation and knew very well what they were thinking
christina saw the change which had come over himhow much firmer and more vigorous both in mind and body he seemed than when she had last seen him
she saw too how well he was dressed and like the others in spite of the return of all her affection for her firstborn was a little alarmed about theobald's pocket which she supposed would have to be mulcted for all this magnificence
perceiving this ernest relieved her mind and told her all about his aunt's bequest and how i had husbanded it in the presence of his brother and sisterwho however pretended not to notice or at any rate to notice as a matter in which they could hardly be expected to take an interest
his mother kicked a little at first against the money's having gone to him as she said over his papa's head
why my dear she said in a deprecating tone this is more than ever your papa has had but ernest calmed her by suggesting that if miss pontifex had known how large the sum would become she would have left the greater part of it to theobald
this compromise was accepted by christina who forthwith ill as she was entered with ardour into the new position and taking it as a fresh point of departure began spending ernest's money for him
i may say in passing that christina was right in saying that theobald had never had so much money as his son was now possessed of
in the first place he had not had a fourteen years' minority with no outgoings to prevent the accumulation of the money and in the second he like myself and almost everyone else had suffered somewhat in the  timesnot enough to cripple him or even seriously to hurt him but enough to give him a scare and make him stick to debentures for the rest of his life
it was the fact of his son's being the richer man of the two and of his being rich so young which rankled with theobald even more than the fact of his having money at all
if he had had to wait till he was sixty or sixtyfive and become broken down from long failure in the meantime why then perhaps he might have been allowed to have whatever sum should suffice to keep him out of the workhouse and pay his deathbed expenses but that he should come in to  pounds at eight and twenty and have no wife and only two childrenit was intolerable
christina was too ill and in too great a hurry to spend the money to care much about such details as the foregoing and she was naturally much more goodnatured than theobald
this piece of good fortuneshe saw it at a glancequite wiped out the disgrace of his having been imprisoned
there should be no more nonsense about that
the whole thing was a mistake an unfortunate mistake true but the less said about it now the better
of course ernest would come back and live at battersby until he was married and he would pay his father handsomely for board and lodging
in fact it would be only right that theobald should make a profit nor would ernest himself wish it to be other than a handsome one this was far the best and simplest arrangement and he could take his sister out more than theobald or joey cared to do and would also doubtless entertain very handsomely at battersby
of course he would buy joey a living and make large presents yearly to his sisterwas there anything else
oh
yeshe would become a county magnate now a man with nearly  pounds a year should certainly become a county magnate
he might even go into parliament
he had very fair abilities nothing indeed approaching such genius as dr skinner's nor even as theobald's still he was not deficient and if he got into parliamentso young toothere was nothing to hinder his being prime minister before he died and if so of course he would become a peer
oh
why did he not set about it all at once so that she might live to hear people call her son 'my lord'lord battersby she thought would do very nicely and if she was well enough to sit he must certainly have her portrait painted at full length for one end of his large dininghall
it should be exhibited at the royal academy 'portrait of lord battersby's mother' she said to herself and her heart fluttered with all its wonted vivacity
if she could not sit happily she had been photographed not so very long ago and the portrait had been as successful as any photograph could be of a face which depended so entirely upon its expression as her own
perhaps the painter could take the portrait sufficiently from this
it was better after all that ernest had given up the churchhow far more wisely god arranges matters for us than ever we can do for ourselves
she saw it all nowit was joey who would become archbishop of canterbury and ernest would remain a layman and become prime minister 
  and so on till her daughter told her it was time to take her medicine
i suppose this reverie which is a mere fragment of what actually ran through christina's brain occupied about a minute and a half but it or the presence of her son seemed to revive her spirits wonderfully
ill dying indeed and suffering as she was she brightened up so as to laugh once or twice quite merrily during the course of the afternoon
next day dr martin said she was so much better that he almost began to have hopes of her recovery again
theobald whenever this was touched upon as possible would shake his head and say we can't wish it prolonged and then charlotte caught ernest unawares and said you know dear ernest that these ups and downs of talk are terribly agitating to papa he could stand whatever comes but it is quite too wearing to him to think halfa dozen different things backwards and forwards up and down in the same twentyfour hours and it would be kinder of you not to do iti mean not to say anything to him even though dr martin does hold out hopes
charlotte had meant to imply that it was ernest who was at the bottom of all the inconvenience felt by theobald herself joey and everyone else and she had actually got words out which should convey this true she had not dared to stick to them and had turned them off but she had made them hers at any rate for one brief moment and this was better than nothing
ernest noticed throughout his mother's illness that charlotte found immediate occasion to make herself disagreeable to him whenever either doctor or nurse pronounced her mother to be a little better
when she wrote to crampsford to desire the prayers of the congregation she was sure her mother would wish it and that the crampsford people would be pleased at her remembrance of them she was sending another letter on some quite different subject at the same time and put the two letters into the wrong envelopes
ernest was asked to take these letters to the village postoffice and imprudently did so when the error came to be discovered christina happened to have rallied a little
charlotte flew at ernest immediately and laid all the blame of the blunder upon his shoulders
except that joey and charlotte were more fully developed the house and its inmates organic and inorganic were little changed since ernest had last seen them
the furniture and the ornaments on the chimneypiece were just as they had been ever since he could remember anything at all
in the drawingroom on either side of the fireplace there hung the carlo dolci and the sassoferrato as in old times there was the water colour of a scene on the lago maggiore copied by charlotte from an original lent her by her drawing master and finished under his direction
this was the picture of which one of the servants had said that it must be good for mr pontifex had given ten shillings for the frame
the paper on the walls was unchanged the roses were still waiting for the bees and the whole family still prayed night and morning to be made truly honest and conscientious
one picture only was removeda photograph of himself which had hung under one of his father and between those of his brother and sister
ernest noticed this at prayer time while his father was reading about noah's ark and how they daubed it with slime which as it happened had been ernest's favourite text when he was a boy
next morning however the photograph had found its way back again a little dusty and with a bit of the gilding chipped off from one corner of the frame but there sure enough it was
i suppose they put it back when they found how rich he had become
in the diningroom the ravens were still trying to feed elijah over the fireplace what a crowd of reminiscences did not this picture bring back
looking out of the window there were the flower beds in the front garden exactly as they had been and ernest found himself looking hard against the blue door at the bottom of the garden to see if there was rain falling as he had been used to look when he was a child doing lessons with his father
after their early dinner when joey and ernest and their father were left alone theobald rose and stood in the middle of the hearthrug under the elijah picture and began to whistle in his old absent way
he had two tunes only one was in my cottage near a wood and the other was the easter hymn he had been trying to whistle them all his life but had never succeeded he whistled them as a clever bullfinch might whistle themhe had got them but he had not got them right he would be a semitone out in every third note as though reverting to some remote musical progenitor who had known none but the lydian or the phrygian mode or whatever would enable him to go most wrong while still keeping the tune near enough to be recognised
theobald stood before the middle of the fire and whistled his two tunes softly in his own old way till ernest left the room the unchangedness of the external and changedness of the internal he felt were likely to throw him completely off his balance
he strolled out of doors into the sodden spinney behind the house and solaced himself with a pipe
ere long he found himself at the door of the cottage of his father's coachman who had married an old lady's maid of his mother's to whom ernest had been always much attached as she also to him for she had known him ever since he had been five or six years old
her name was susan
he sat down in the rockingchair before her fire and susan went on ironing at the table in front of the window and a smell of hot flannel pervaded the kitchen
susan had been retained too securely by christina to be likely to side with ernest all in a moment
he knew this very well and did not call on her for the sake of support moral or otherwise
he had called because he liked her and also because he knew that he should gather much in a chat with her that he should not be able to arrive at in any other way
oh master ernest said susan why did you not come back when your poor papa and mamma wanted you
i'm sure your ma has said to me a hundred times over if she has said it once that all should be exactly as it had been before
ernest smiled to himself
it was no use explaining to susan why he smiled so he said nothing
for the first day or two i thought she never would get over it she said it was a judgement upon her and went on about things as she had said and done many years ago before your pa knew her and i don't know what she didn't say or wouldn't have said only i stopped her she seemed out of her mind like and said that none of the neighbours would ever speak to her again but the next day mrs bushby her that was miss cowey you know called and your ma always was so fond of her and it seemed to do her a power o' good for the next day she went through all her dresses and we settled how she should have them altered and then all the neighbours called for miles and miles round and your ma came in here and said she had been going through the waters of misery and the lord had turned them to a well
'oh yes susan' said she 'be sure it is so
whom the lord loveth he chasteneth susan' and here she began to cry again
'as for him' she went on 'he has made his bed and he must lie on it when he comes out of prison his pa will know what is best to be done and master ernest may be thankful that he has a pa so good and so longsuffering'
then when you would not see them that was a cruel blow to your ma
your pa did not say anything you know your pa never does say very much unless he's downright waxy for the time but your ma took on dreadful for a few days and i never saw the master look so black but bless you it all went off in a few days and i don't know that there's been much difference in either of them since then not till your ma was took ill  on the night of his arrival he had behaved well at family prayers as also on the following morning his father read about david's dying injunctions to solomon in the matter of shimei but he did not mind it
in the course of the day however his corns had been trodden on so many times that he was in a misbehaving humour on this the second night after his arrival
he knelt next charlotte and said the responses perfunctorily not so perfunctorily that she should know for certain that he was doing it maliciously but so perfunctorily as to make her uncertain whether he might be malicious or not and when he had to pray to be made truly honest and conscientious he emphasised the truly
i do not know whether charlotte noticed anything but she knelt at some distance from him during the rest of his stay
he assures me that this was the only spiteful thing he did during the whole time he was at battersby
when he went up to his bedroom in which to do them justice they had given him a fire he noticed what indeed he had noticed as soon as he was shown into it on his arrival that there was an illuminated card framed and glazed over his bed with the words be the day weary or be the day long at last it ringeth to evensong
he wondered to himself how such people could leave such a card in a room in which their visitors would have to spend the last hours of their evening but he let it alone
there's not enough difference between 'weary' and 'long' to warrant an 'or' he said but i suppose it is all right
i believe christina had bought the card at a bazaar in aid of the restoration of a neighbouring church and having been bought it had got to be usedbesides the sentiment was so touching and the illumination was really lovely
anyhow no irony could be more complete than leaving it in my hero's bedroom though assuredly no irony had been intended
on the third day after ernest's arrival christina relapsed again
for the last two days she had been in no pain and had slept a good deal her son's presence still seemed to cheer her and she often said how thankful she was to be surrounded on her deathbed by a family so happy so god fearing so united but now she began to wander and being more sensible of the approach of death seemed also more alarmed at the thoughts of the day of judgment
she ventured more than once or twice to return to the subject of her sins and implored theobald to make quite sure that they were forgiven her
she hinted that she considered his professional reputation was at stake it would never do for his own wife to fail in securing at any rate a pass
this was touching theobald on a tender spot he winced and rejoined with an impatient toss of the head but christina they are forgiven you and then he entrenched himself in a firm but dignified manner behind the lord's prayer
when he rose he left the room but called ernest out to say that he could not wish it prolonged
joey was no more use in quieting his mother's anxiety than theobald had beenindeed he was only theobald and water at last ernest who had not liked interfering took the matter in hand and sitting beside her let her pour out her grief to him without let or hindrance
she said she knew she had not given up all for christ's sake it was this that weighed upon her
she had given up much and had always tried to give up more year by year still she knew very well that she had not been so spiritually minded as she ought to have been
if she had she should probably have been favoured with some direct vision or communication whereas though god had vouchsafed such direct and visible angelic visits to one of her dear children yet she had had none such herselfnor even had theobald
she was talking rather to herself than to ernest as she said these words but they made him open his ears
he wanted to know whether the angel had appeared to joey or to charlotte
he asked his mother but she seemed surprised as though she expected him to know all about it then as if she remembered she checked herself and said ah
yesyou know nothing of all this and perhaps it is as well
ernest could not of course press the subject so he never found out which of his near relations it was who had had direct communication with an immortal
the others never said anything to him about it though whether this was because they were ashamed or because they feared he would not believe the story and thus increase his own damnation he could not determine
ernest has often thought about this since
he tried to get the facts out of susan who he was sure would know but charlotte had been beforehand with him
no master ernest said susan when he began to question her your ma has sent a message to me by miss charlotte as i am not to say nothing at all about it and i never will
of course no further questioning was possible
it had more than once occurred to ernest that charlotte did not in reality believe more than he did himself and this incident went far to strengthen his surmises but he wavered when he remembered how she had misdirected the letter asking for the prayers of the congregation
i suppose he said to himself gloomily she does believe in it after all
then christina returned to the subject of her own want of spiritualmindedness she even harped upon the old grievance of her having eaten black puddingstrue she had given them up years ago but for how many years had she not persevered in eating them after she had had misgivings about their having been forbidden
then there was something that weighed on her mind that had taken place before her marriage and she should like  ernest interrupted my dear mother he said you are ill and your mind is unstrung others can now judge better about you than you can i assure you that to me you seem to have been the most devotedly unselfish wife and mother that ever lived
even if you have not literally given up all for christ's sake you have done so practically as far as it was in your power and more than this is not required of anyone
i believe you will not only be a saint but a very distinguished one
at these words christina brightened
you give me hope you give me hope she cried and dried her eyes
she made him assure her over and over again that this was his solemn conviction she did not care about being a distinguished saint now she would be quite content to be among the meanest who actually got into heaven provided she could make sure of escaping that awful hell
the fear of this evidently was omnipresent with her and in spite of all ernest could say he did not quite dispel it
she was rather ungrateful i must confess for after more than an hour's consolation from ernest she prayed for him that he might have every blessing in this world inasmuch as she always feared that he was the only one of her children whom she should never meet in heaven but she was then wandering and was hardly aware of his presence her mind in fact was reverting to states in which it had been before her illness
on sunday ernest went to church as a matter of course and noted that the ever receding tide of evangelicalism had ebbed many a stage lower even during the few years of his absence
his father used to walk to the church through the rectory garden and across a small intervening field
he had been used to walk in a tall hat his master's gown and wearing a pair of geneva bands
ernest noticed that the bands were worn no longer and lo
greater marvel still theobald did not preach in his master's gown but in a surplice
the whole character of the service was changed you could not say it was high even now for highchurch theobald could never under any circumstances become but the old easygoing slovenliness if i may say so was gone for ever
the orchestral accompaniments to the hymns had disappeared while my hero was yet a boy but there had been no chanting for some years after the harmonium had been introduced
while ernest was at cambridge charlotte and christina had prevailed on theobald to allow the canticles to be sung and sung they were to oldfashioned double chants by lord mornington and dr dupuis and others
theobald did not like it but he did it or allowed it to be done
then christina said my dear do you know i really think christina always really thought that the people like the chanting very much and that it will be a means of bringing many to church who have stayed away hitherto
i was talking about it to mrs goodhew and to old miss wright only yesterday and they quite agreed with me but they all said that we ought to chant the 'glory be to the father' at the end of each of the psalms instead of saying it
theobald looked blackhe felt the waters of chanting rising higher and higher upon him inch by inch but he felt also he knew not why that he had better yield than fight
so he ordered the glory be to the father to be chanted in future but he did not like it
really mamma dear said charlotte when the battle was won you should not call it the 'glory be to the father' you should say 'gloria'
of course my dear said christina and she said gloria for ever after
then she thought what a wonderfully clever girl charlotte was and how she ought to marry no one lower than a bishop
byandby when theobald went away for an unusually long holiday one summer he could find no one but a rather highchurch clergyman to take his duty
this gentleman was a man of weight in the neighbourhood having considerable private means but without preferment
in the summer he would often help his brother clergymen and it was through his being willing to take the duty at battersby for a few sundays that theobald had been able to get away for so long
on his return however he found that the whole psalms were being chanted as well as the glorias
the influential clergyman christina and charlotte took the bull by the horns as soon as theobald returned and laughed it all off and the clergyman laughed and bounced and christina laughed and coaxed and charlotte uttered unexceptionable sentiments and the thing was done now and could not be undone and it was no use grieving over spilt milk so henceforth the psalms were to be chanted but theobald grisled over it in his heart and he did not like it
during this same absence what had mrs goodhew and old miss wright taken to doing but turning towards the east while repeating the belief
theobald disliked this even worse than chanting
when he said something about it in a timid way at dinner after service charlotte said really papa dear you must take to calling it the 'creed' and not the 'belief' and theobald winced impatiently and snorted meek defiance but the spirit of her aunts jane and eliza was strong in charlotte and the thing was too small to fight about and he turned it off with a laugh
as for charlotte thought christina i believe she knows everything
so mrs goodhew and old miss wright continued to turn to the east during the time the creed was said and byandby others followed their example and ere long the few who had stood out yielded and turned eastward too and then theobald made as though he had thought it all very right and proper from the first but like it he did not
by andby charlotte tried to make him say alleluia instead of hallelujah but this was going too far and theobald turned and she got frightened and ran away
and they changed the double chants for single ones and altered them psalm by psalm and in the middle of psalms just where a cursory reader would see no reason why they should do so they changed from major to minor and from minor back to major and then they got hymns ancient and modern and as i have said they robbed him of his beloved bands and they made him preach in a surplice and he must have celebration of the holy communion once a month instead of only five times in the year as heretofore and he struggled in vain against the unseen influence which he felt to be working in season and out of season against all that he had been accustomed to consider most distinctive of his party
where it was or what it was he knew not nor exactly what it would do next but he knew exceedingly well that go where he would it was undermining him that it was too persistent for him that christina and charlotte liked it a great deal better than he did and that it could end in nothing but rome
easter decorations indeed
christmas decorationsin reasonwere proper enough but easter decorations
well it might last his time
this was the course things had taken in the church of england during the last forty years
the set has been steadily in one direction
a few men who knew what they wanted made cats' paws of the christmas and the charlottes and the christmas and the charlottes made cats' paws of the mrs goodhews and the old miss wrights and mrs goodhews and old miss wrights told the mr goodhews and young miss wrights what they should do and when the mr goodhews and the young miss wrights did it the little goodhews and the rest of the spiritual flock did as they did and the theobalds went for nothing step by step day by day year by year parish by parish diocese by diocese this was how it was done
and yet the church of england looks with no friendly eyes upon the theory of evolution or descent with modification
my hero thought over these things and remembered many a ruse on the part of christina and charlotte and many a detail of the struggle which i cannot further interrupt my story to refer to and he remembered his father's favourite retort that it could only end in rome
when he was a boy he had firmly believed this but he smiled now as he thought of another alternative clear enough to himself but so horrible that it had not even occurred to theobaldi mean the toppling over of the whole system
at that time he welcomed the hope that the absurdities and unrealities of the church would end in her downfall
since then he has come to think very differently not as believing in the cow jumping over the moon more than he used to or more probably than ninetenths of the clergy themselveswho know as well as he does that their outward and visible symbols are out of datebut because he knows the baffling complexity of the problem when it comes to deciding what is actually to be done
also now that he has seen them more closely he knows better the nature of those wolves in sheep's clothing who are thirsting for the blood of their victim and exulting so clamorously over its anticipated early fall into their clutches
the spirit behind the church is true though her lettertrue onceis now true no longer
the spirit behind the high priests of science is as lying as its letter
the theobalds who do what they do because it seems to be the correct thing but who in their hearts neither like it nor believe in it are in reality the least dangerous of all classes to the peace and liberties of mankind
the man to fear is he who goes at things with the cocksureness of pushing vulgarity and selfconceit
these are not vices which can be justly laid to the charge of the english clergy
many of the farmers came up to ernest when service was over and shook hands with him
he found every one knew of his having come into a fortune
the fact was that theobald had immediately told two or three of the greatest gossips in the village and the story was not long in spreading
it simplified matters he had said to himself a good deal
ernest was civil to mrs goodhew for her husband's sake but he gave miss wright the cut direct for he knew that she was only charlotte in disguise
a week passed slowly away
two or three times the family took the sacrament together round christina's deathbed
theobald's impatience became more and more transparent daily but fortunately christina who even if she had been well would have been ready to shut her eyes to it became weaker and less coherent in mind also so that she hardly if at all perceived it
after ernest had been in the house about a week his mother fell into a comatose state which lasted a couple of days and in the end went away so peacefully that it was like the blending of sea and sky in midocean upon a soft hazy day when none can say where the earth ends and the heavens begin
indeed she died to the realities of life with less pain than she had waked from many of its illusions
she has been the comfort and mainstay of my life for more than thirty years said theobald as soon as all was over but one could not wish it prolonged and he buried his face in his handkerchief to conceal his want of emotion
ernest came back to town the day after his mother's death and returned to the funeral accompanied by myself
he wanted me to see his father in order to prevent any possible misapprehension about miss pontifex's intentions and i was such an old friend of the family that my presence at christina's funeral would surprise no one
with all her faults i had always rather liked christina
she would have chopped ernest or any one else into little pieces of mincemeat to gratify the slightest wish of her husband but she would not have chopped him up for any one else and so long as he did not cross her she was very fond of him
by nature she was of an even temper more willing to be pleased than ruffled very ready to do a goodnatured action provided it did not cost her much exertion nor involve expense to theobald
her own little purse did not matter any one might have as much of that as he or she could get after she had reserved what was absolutely necessary for her dress
i could not hear of her end as ernest described it to me without feeling very compassionate towards her indeed her own son could hardly have felt more so i at once therefore consented to go down to the funeral perhaps i was also influenced by a desire to see charlotte and joey in whom i felt interested on hearing what my godson had told me
i found theobald looking remarkably well
every one said he was bearing it so beautifully
he did indeed once or twice shake his head and say that his wife had been the comfort and mainstay of his life for over thirty years but there the matter ended
i stayed over the next day which was sunday and took my departure on the following morning after having told theobald all that his son wished me to tell him
theobald asked me to help him with christina's epitaph
i would say said he as little as possible eulogies of the departed are in most cases both unnecessary and untrue
christina's epitaph shall contain nothing which shall be either the one or the other
i should give her name the dates of her birth and death and of course say she was my wife and then i think i should wind up with a simple texther favourite one for example none indeed could be more appropriate 'blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god'
i said i thought this would be very nice and it was settled
so ernest was sent to give the order to mr prosser the stonemason in the nearest town who said it came from the beetitudes
chapter lxxxiv   on our way to town ernest broached his plans for spending the next year or two
i wanted him to try and get more into society again but he brushed this aside at once as the very last thing he had a fancy for
for society indeed of all sorts except of course that of a few intimate friends he had an unconquerable aversion
i always did hate those people he said and they always have hated and always will hate me
i am an ishmael by instinct as much as by accident of circumstances but if i keep out of society i shall be less vulnerable than ishmaels generally are
the moment a man goes into society he becomes vulnerable all round
i was very sorry to hear him talk in this way for whatever strength a man may have he should surely be able to make more of it if he act in concert than alone
i said this
i don't care he answered whether i make the most of my strength or not i don't know whether i have any strength but if i have i dare say it will find some way of exerting itself
i will live as i like living not as other people would like me to live thanks to my aunt and you i can afford the luxury of a quiet unobtrusive life of selfindulgence said he laughing and i mean to have it
you know i like writing he added after a pause of some minutes i have been a scribbler for years
if i am to come to the fore at all it must be by writing
i had already long since come to that conclusion myself
well he continued there are a lot of things that want saying which no one dares to say a lot of shams which want attacking and yet no one attacks them
it seems to me that i can say things which not another man in england except myself will venture to say and yet which are crying to be said
i said but who will listen
if you say things which nobody else would dare to say is not this much the same as saying what everyone except yourself knows to be better left unsaid just now
perhaps said he but i don't know it i am bursting with these things and it is my fate to say them
i knew there would be no stopping him so i gave in and asked what question he felt a special desire to burn his fingers with in the first instance
marriage he rejoined promptly and the power of disposing of his property after a man is dead
the question of christianity is virtually settled or if not settled there is no lack of those engaged in settling it
the question of the day now is marriage and the family system
that said i drily is a hornet's nest indeed
yes said he no less drily but hornet's nests are exactly what i happen to like
before however i begin to stir up this particular one i propose to travel for a few years with the especial object of finding out what nations now existing are the best comeliest and most lovable and also what nations have been so in times past
i want to find out how these people live and have lived and what their customs are
i have very vague notions upon the subject as yet but the general impression i have formed is that putting ourselves on one side the most vigorous and amiable of known nations are the modern italians the old greeks and romans and the south sea islanders
i believe that these nice peoples have not as a general rule been purists but i want to see those of them who can yet be seen they are the practical authorities on the questionwhat is best for man
and i should like to see them and find out what they do
let us settle the fact first and fight about the moral tendencies afterwards
in fact said i laughingly you mean to have high old times
neither higher nor lower was the answer than those people whom i can find to have been the best in all ages
but let us change the subject
he put his hand into his pocket and brought out a letter
my father he said gave me this letter this morning with the seal already broken
he passed it over to me and i found it to be the one which christina had written before the birth of her last child and which i have given in an earlier chapter
and you do not find this letter said i affect the conclusion which you have just told me you have come to concerning your present plans
he smiled and answered no
but if you do what you have sometimes talked about and turn the adventures of my unworthy self into a novel mind you print this letter
why so
said i feeling as though such a letter as this should have been held sacred from the public gaze
because my mother would have wished it published if she had known you were writing about me and had this letter in your possession she would above all things have desired that you should publish it
therefore publish it if you write at all
this is why i have done so
within a month ernest carried his intention into effect and having made all the arrangements necessary for his children's welfare left england before christmas
i heard from him now and again and learnt that he was visiting almost all parts of the world but only staying in those places where he found the inhabitants unusually goodlooking and agreeable
he said he had filled an immense quantity of notebooks and i have no doubt he had
at last in the spring of  he returned his luggage stained with the variation of each hotel advertisement 'twixt here and japan
he looked very brown and strong and so well favoured that it almost seemed as if he must have caught some good looks from the people among whom he had been living
he came back to his old rooms in the temple and settled down as easily as if he had never been away a day
one of the first things we did was to go and see the children we took the train to gravesend and walked thence for a few miles along the riverside till we came to the solitary house where the good people lived with whom ernest had placed them
it was a lovely april morning but with a fresh air blowing from off the sea the tide was high and the river was alive with shipping coming up with wind and tide
seagulls wheeled around us overhead seaweed clung everywhere to the banks which the advancing tide had not yet covered everything was of the sea seaey and the fine bracing air which blew over the water made me feel more hungry than i had done for many a day i did not see how children could live in a better physical atmosphere than this and applauded the selection which ernest had made on behalf of his youngsters
while we were still a quarter of a mile off we heard shouts and children's laughter and could see a lot of boys and girls romping together and running after one another
we could not distinguish our own two but when we got near they were soon made out for the other children were blueeyed flaxenpated little folks whereas ours were dark and straighthaired
we had written to say that we were coming but had desired that nothing should be said to the children so these paid no more attention to us than they would have done to any other stranger who happened to visit a spot so unfrequented except by seafaring folk which we plainly were not
the interest however in us was much quickened when it was discovered that we had got our pockets full of oranges and sweeties to an extent greater than it had entered into their small imaginations to conceive as possible
at first we had great difficulty in making them come near us
they were like a lot of wild young colts very inquisitive but very coy and not to be cajoled easily
the children were nine in allfive boys and two girls belonging to mr and mrs rollings and two to ernest
i never saw a finer lot of children than the young rollings the boys were hardy robust fearless little fellows with eyes as clear as hawks the elder girl was exquisitely pretty but the younger one was a mere baby
i felt as i looked at them that if i had had children of my own i could have wished no better home for them nor better companions
georgie and alice ernest's two children were evidently quite as one family with the others and called mr and mrs rollings uncle and aunt
they had been so young when they were first brought to the house that they had been looked upon in the light of new babies who had been born into the family
they knew nothing about mr and mrs rollings being paid so much a week to look after them
ernest asked them all what they wanted to be
they had only one idea one and all georgie among the rest wanted to be bargemen
young ducks could hardly have a more evident hankering after the water
and what do you want alice
said ernest
oh she said i'm going to marry jack here and be a bargeman's wife
jack was the eldest boy now nearly twelve a sturdy little fellow the image of what mr rollings must have been at his age
as we looked at him so straight and well grown and well done all round i could see it was in ernest's mind as much as in mine that she could hardly do much better
come here jack my boy said ernest here's a shilling for you
the boy blushed and could hardly be got to come in spite of our previous blandishments he had had pennies given him before but shillings never
his father caught him goodnaturedly by the ear and lugged him to us
he's a good boy jack is said ernest to mr rollings i'm sure of that
yes said mr rollings he's a werry good boy only that i can't get him to learn his reading and writing
he don't like going to school that's the only complaint i have against him
i don't know what's the matter with all my children and yours mr pontifex is just as bad but they none of 'em likes book learning though they learn anything else fast enough
why as for jack here he's almost as good a bargeman as i am
and he looked fondly and patronisingly towards his offspring
i think said ernest to mr rollings if he wants to marry alice when he gets older he had better do so and he shall have as many barges as he likes
in the meantime mr rollings say in what way money can be of use to you and whatever you can make useful is at your disposal
i need hardly say that ernest made matters easy for this good couple one stipulation however he insisted on namely there was to be no more smuggling and that the young people were to be kept out of this for a little bird had told ernest that smuggling in a quiet way was one of the resources of the rollings family
mr rollings was not sorry to assent to this and i believe it is now many years since the coastguard people have suspected any of the rollings family as offenders against the revenue law
why should i take them from where they are said ernest to me in the train as we went home to send them to schools where they will not be one half so happy and where their illegitimacy will very likely be a worry to them
georgie wants to be a bargeman let him begin as one the sooner the better he may as well begin with this as with anything else then if he shows developments i can be on the lookout to encourage them and make things easy for him while if he shows no desire to go ahead what on earth is the good of trying to shove him forward
ernest i believe went on with a homily upon education generally and upon the way in which young people should go through the embryonic stages with their money as much as with their limbs beginning life in a much lower social position than that in which their parents were and a lot more which he has since published but i was getting on in years and the walk and the bracing air had made me sleepy so ere we had got past greenhithe station on our return journey i had sunk into a refreshing sleep
chapter lxxxv   ernest being about two and thirty years old and having had his fling for the last three or four years now settled down in london and began to write steadily
up to this time he had given abundant promise but had produced nothing nor indeed did he come before the public for another three or four years yet
he lived as i have said very quietly seeing hardly anyone but myself and the three or four old friends with whom i had been intimate for years
ernest and we formed our little set and outside of this my godson was hardly known at all
his main expense was travelling which he indulged in at frequent intervals but for short times only
do what he would he could not get through more than about fifteen hundred a year the rest of his income he gave away if he happened to find a case where he thought money would be well bestowed or put by until some opportunity arose of getting rid of it with advantage
i knew he was writing but we had had so many little differences of opinion upon this head that by a tacit understanding the subject was seldom referred to between us and i did not know that he was actually publishing till one day he brought me a book and told me flat it was his own
i opened it and found it to be a series of semitheological semi social essays purporting to have been written by six or seven different people and viewing the same class of subjects from different standpoints
people had not yet forgotten the famous essays and reviews and ernest had wickedly given a few touches to at least two of the essays which suggested vaguely that they had been written by a bishop
the essays were all of them in support of the church of england and appeared both by internal suggestion and their prima facie purport to be the work of some halfdozen men of experience and high position who had determined to face the difficult questions of the day no less boldly from within the bosom of the church than the church's enemies had faced them from without her pale
there was an essay on the external evidences of the resurrection another on the marriage laws of the most eminent nations of the world in times past and present another was devoted to a consideration of the many questions which must be reopened and reconsidered on their merits if the teaching of the church of england were to cease to carry moral authority with it another dealt with the more purely social subject of middle class destitution another with the authenticity or rather the unauthenticity of the fourth gospelanother was headed irrational rationalism and there were two or three more
they were all written vigorously and fearlessly as though by people used to authority all granted that the church professed to enjoin belief in much which no one could accept who had been accustomed to weigh evidence but it was contended that so much valuable truth had got so closely mixed up with these mistakes that the mistakes had better not be meddled with
to lay great stress on these was like cavilling at the queen's right to reign on the ground that william the conqueror was illegitimate
one article maintained that though it would be inconvenient to change the words of our prayer book and articles it would not be inconvenient to change in a quiet way the meanings which we put upon those words
this it was argued was what was actually done in the case of law this had been the law's mode of growth and adaptation and had in all ages been found a righteous and convenient method of effecting change
it was suggested that the church should adopt it
in another essay it was boldly denied that the church rested upon reason
it was proved incontestably that its ultimate foundation was and ought to be faith there being indeed no other ultimate foundation than this for any of man's beliefs
if so the writer claimed that the church could not be upset by reason
it was founded like everything else on initial assumptions that is to say on faith and if it was to be upset it was to be upset by faith by the faith of those who in their lives appeared more graceful more lovable better bred in fact and better able to overcome difficulties
any sect which showed its superiority in these respects might carry all before it but none other would make much headway for long together
christianity was true in so far as it had fostered beauty and it had fostered much beauty
it was false in so far as it fostered ugliness and it had fostered much ugliness
it was therefore not a little true and not a little false on the whole one might go farther and fare worse the wisest course would be to live with it and make the best and not the worst of it
the writer urged that we become persecutors as a matter of course as soon as we begin to feel very strongly upon any subject we ought not therefore to do this we ought not to feel very stronglyeven upon that institution which was dearer to the writer than any otherthe church of england
we should be churchmen but somewhat lukewarm churchmen inasmuch as those who care very much about either religion or irreligion are seldom observed to be very well bred or agreeable people
the church herself should approach as nearly to that of laodicea as was compatible with her continuing to be a church at all and each individual member should only be hot in striving to be as lukewarm as possible
the book rang with the courage alike of conviction and of an entire absence of conviction it appeared to be the work of men who had a rule ofthumb way of steering between iconoclasm on the one hand and credulity on the other who cut gordian knots as a matter of course when it suited their convenience who shrank from no conclusion in theory nor from any want of logic in practice so long as they were illogical of malice prepense and for what they held to be sufficient reason
the conclusions were conservative quietistic comforting
the arguments by which they were reached were taken from the most advanced writers of the day
all that these people contended for was granted them but the fruits of victory were for the most part handed over to those already in possession
perhaps the passage which attracted most attention in the book was one from the essay on the various marriage systems of the world
it ran  if people require us to construct exclaimed the writer we set good breeding as the cornerstone of our edifice
we would have it ever present consciously or unconsciously in the minds of all as the central faith in which they should live and move and have their being as the touchstone of all things whereby they may be known as good or evil according as they make for good breeding or against it
that a man should have been bred well and breed others well that his figure head hands feet voice manner and clothes should carry conviction upon this point so that no one can look at him without seeing that he has come of good stock and is likely to throw good stock himself this is the desiderandum
and the same with a woman
the greatest number of these wellbred men and women and the greatest happiness of these wellbred men and women this is the highest good towards this all government all social conventions all art literature and science should directly or indirectly tend
holy men and holy women are those who keep this unconsciously in view at all times whether of work or pastime
if ernest had published this work in his own name i should think it would have fallen stillborn from the press but the form he had chosen was calculated at that time to arouse curiosity and as i have said he had wickedly dropped a few hints which the reviewers did not think anyone would have been impudent enough to do if he were not a bishop or at any rate some one in authority
a wellknown judge was spoken of as being another of the writers and the idea spread ere long that six or seven of the leading bishops and judges had laid their heads together to produce a volume which should at once outbid essays and reviews and counteract the influence of that then still famous work
reviewers are men of like passions with ourselves and with them as with everyone else omne ignotum pro magnifico
the book was really an able one and abounded with humour just satire and good sense
it struck a new note and the speculation which for some time was rife concerning its authorship made many turn to it who would never have looked at it otherwise
one of the most gushing weeklies had a fit over it and declared it to be the finest thing that had been done since the provincial letters of pascal
once a month or so that weekly always found some picture which was the finest that had been done since the old masters or some satire that was the finest that had appeared since swift or some something which was incomparably the finest that had appeared since something else
if ernest had put his name to the book and the writer had known that it was by a nobody he would doubtless have written in a very different strain
reviewers like to think that for aught they know they are patting a duke or even a prince of the blood upon the back and lay it on thick till they find they have been only praising brown jones or robinson
then they are disappointed and as a general rule will pay brown jones or robinson out
ernest was not so much up to the ropes of the literary world as i was and i am afraid his head was a little turned when he woke up one morning to find himself famous
he was christina's son and perhaps would not have been able to do what he had done if he was not capable of occasional undue elation
ere long however he found out all about it and settled quietly down to write a series of books in which he insisted on saying things which no one else would say even if they could or could even if they would
he has got himself a bad literary character
i said to him laughingly one day that he was like the man in the last century of whom it was said that nothing but such a character could keep down such parts
he laughed and said he would rather be like that than like a modern writer or two whom he could name whose parts were so poor that they could be kept up by nothing but by such a character
i remember soon after one of these books was published i happened to meet mrs jupp to whom by the way ernest made a small weekly allowance
it was at ernest's chambers and for some reason we were left alone for a few minutes
i said to her mr pontifex has written another book mrs jupp
lor' now said she has he really
dear gentleman
is it about love
and the old sinner threw up a wicked sheep's eye glance at me from under her aged eyelids
i forget what there was in my reply which provoked itprobably nothingbut she went rattling on at full speed to the effect that bell had given her a ticket for the opera so of course she said i went
i didn't understand one word of it for it was all french but i saw their legs
oh dear oh dear
i'm afraid i shan't be here much longer and when dear mr pontifex sees me in my coffin he'll say 'poor old jupp she'll never talk broad any more' but bless you i'm not so old as all that and i'm taking lessons in dancing
at this moment ernest came in and the conversation was changed
mrs jupp asked if he was still going on writing more books now that this one was done
of course i am he answered i'm always writing books here is the manuscript of my next and he showed her a heap of paper
well now she exclaimed dear dear me and is that manuscript
i've often heard talk about manuscripts but i never thought i should live to see some myself
well
well
so that is really manuscript
there were a few geraniums in the window and they did not look well
ernest asked mrs jupp if she understood flowers
i understand the language of flowers she said with one of her most bewitching leers and on this we sent her off till she should choose to honour us with another visit which she knows she is privileged from time to time to do for ernest likes her
chapter lxxxvi   and now i must bring my story to a close
the preceding chapter was written soon after the events it recordsthat is to say in the spring of 
by that time my story had been written up to this point but it has been altered here and there from time to time occasionally
it is now the autumn of  and if i am to say more i should do so quickly for i am eighty years old and though well in health cannot conceal from myself that i am no longer young
ernest himself is fortyseven though he hardly looks it
he is richer than ever for he has never married and his london and north western shares have nearly doubled themselves
through sheer inability to spend his income he has been obliged to hoard in selfdefence
he still lives in the temple in the same rooms i took for him when he gave up his shop for no one has been able to induce him to take a house
his house he says is wherever there is a good hotel
when he is in town he likes to work and to be quiet
when out of town he feels that he has left little behind him that can go wrong and he would not like to be tied to a single locality
i know no exception he says to the rule that it is cheaper to buy milk than to keep a cow
as i have mentioned mrs jupp i may as well say here the little that remains to be said about her
she is a very old woman now but no one now living as she says triumphantly can say how old for the woman in the old kent road is dead and presumably has carried her secret to the grave
old however though she is she lives in the same house and finds it hard work to make the two ends meet but i do not know that she minds this very much and it has prevented her from getting more to drink than would be good for her
it is no use trying to do anything for her beyond paying her allowance weekly and absolutely refusing to let her anticipate it
she pawns her flat iron every saturday for d and takes it out every monday morning for d
when she gets her allowance and has done this for the last ten years as regularly as the week comes round
as long as she does not let the flat iron actually go we know that she can still worry out her financial problems in her own hugger mugger way and had better be left to do so
if the flat iron were to go beyond redemption we should know that it was time to interfere
i do not know why but there is something about her which always reminds me of a woman who was as unlike her as one person can be to anotheri mean ernest's mother
the last time i had a long gossip with her was about two years ago when she came to me instead of to ernest
she said she had seen a cab drive up just as she was going to enter the staircase and had seen mr pontifex's pa put his beelzebub old head out of the window so she had come on to me for she hadn't greased her sides for no curtsey not for the likes of him
she professed to be very much down on her luck
her lodgers did use her so dreadful going away without paying and leaving not so much as a stick behind but today she was as pleased as a penny carrot
she had had such a lovely dinnera cushion of ham and green peas
she had had a good cry over it but then she was so silly she was
and there's that bell she continued though i could not detect any appearance of connection it's enough to give anyone the hump to see him now that he's taken to chapelgoing and his mother's prepared to meet jesus and all that to me and now she ain't agoing to die and drinks half a bottle of champagne a day and then grigg him as preaches you know asked bell if i really was too gay not but what when i was young i'd snap my fingers at any 'fly by night' in holborn and if i was togged out and had my teeth i'd do it now
i lost my poor dear watkins but of course that couldn't be helped and then i lost my dear rose
silly faggot to go and ride on a cart and catch the bronchitics
i never thought when i kissed my dear rose in pullen's passage and she gave me the chop that i should never see her again and her gentleman friend was fond of her too though he was a married man
i daresay she's gone to bits by now
if she could rise and see me with my bad finger she would cry and i should say 'never mind ducky i'm all right'
oh
dear it's coming on to rain
i do hate a wet saturday nightpoor women with their nice white stockings and their living to get etc etc
and yet age does not wither this godless old sinner as people would say it ought to do
whatever life she has led it has agreed with her very sufficiently
at times she gives us to understand that she is still much solicited at others she takes quite a different tone
she has not allowed even joe king so much as to put his lips to hers this ten years
she would rather have a mutton chop any day
but ah
you should have seen me when i was sweet seventeen
i was the very moral of my poor dear mother and she was a pretty woman though i say it that shouldn't
she had such a splendid mouth of teeth
it was a sin to bury her in her teeth
i only knew of one thing at which she professes to be shocked
it is that her son tom and his wife topsy are teaching the baby to swear
oh
it's too dreadful awful she exclaimed i don't know the meaning of the words but i tell him he's a drunken sot
i believe the old woman in reality rather likes it
but surely mrs jupp said i tom's wife used not to be topsy
you used to speak of her as pheeb
ah
yes she answered but pheeb behaved bad and it's topsy now
ernest's daughter alice married the boy who had been her playmate more than a year ago
ernest gave them all they said they wanted and a good deal more
they have already presented him with a grandson and i doubt not will do so with many more
georgie though only twentyone is owner of a fine steamer which his father has bought for him
he began when about thirteen going with old rollings and jack in the barge from rochester to the upper thames with bricks then his father bought him and jack barges of their own and then he bought them both ships and then steamers
i do not exactly know how people make money by having a steamer but he does whatever is usual and from all i can gather makes it pay extremely well
he is a good deal like his father in the face but without a sparkso far as i have been able to observeany literary ability he has a fair sense of humour and abundance of common sense but his instinct is clearly a practical one
i am not sure that he does not put me in mind almost more of what theobald would have been if he had been a sailor than of ernest
ernest used to go down to battersby and stay with his father for a few days twice a year until theobald's death and the pair continued on excellent terms in spite of what the neighbouring clergy call the atrocious books which mr ernest pontifex has written
perhaps the harmony or rather absence of discord which subsisted between the pair was due to the fact that theobald had never looked into the inside of one of his son's works and ernest of course never alluded to them in his father's presence
the pair as i have said got on excellently but it was doubtless as well that ernest's visits were short and not too frequent
once theobald wanted ernest to bring his children but ernest knew they would not like it so this was not done
sometimes theobald came up to town on small business matters and paid a visit to ernest's chambers he generally brought with him a couple of lettuces or a cabbage or halfadozen turnips done up in a piece of brown paper and told ernest that he knew fresh vegetables were rather hard to get in london and he had brought him some
ernest had often explained to him that the vegetables were of no use to him and that he had rather he would not bring them but theobald persisted i believe through sheer love of doing something which his son did not like but which was too small to take notice of
he lived until about twelve months ago when he was found dead in his bed on the morning after having written the following letter to his son     dear ernesti've nothing particular to write about but your letter    has been lying for some days in the limbo of unanswered letters to    wit my pocket and it's time it was answered
i keep wonderfully well and am able to walk my five or six miles with    comfort but at my age there's no knowing how long it will last and    time flies quickly
i have been busy potting plants all the morning    but this afternoon is wet
what is this horrid government going to do with ireland
i don't    exactly wish they'd blow up mr gladstone but if a mad bull would    chivy him there and he would never come back any more i should not    be sorry
lord hartington is not exactly the man i should like to set    in his place but he would be immeasurably better than gladstone
i miss your sister charlotte more than i can express
she kept my    household accounts and i could pour out to her all little worries    and now that joey is married too i don't know what i should do if one    or other of them did not come sometimes and take care of me
my only    comfort is that charlotte will make her husband happy and that he is    as nearly worthy of her as a husband can well bebelieve me your    affectionate father     theobald pontifex
i may say in passing that though theobald speaks of charlotte's marriage as though it were recent it had really taken place some six years previously she being then about thirtyeight years old and her husband about seven years younger
there was no doubt that theobald passed peacefully away during his sleep
can a man who died thus be said to have died at all
he has presented the phenomena of death to other people but in respect of himself he has not only not died but has not even thought that he was going to die
this is not more than half dying but then neither was his life more than half living
he presented so many of the phenomena of living that i suppose on the whole it would be less trouble to think of him as having been alive than as never having been born at all but this is only possible because association does not stick to the strict letter of its bond
this however was not the general verdict concerning him and the general verdict is often the truest
ernest was overwhelmed with expressions of condolence and respect for his father's memory
he never said dr martin the old doctor who brought ernest into the world spoke an ill word against anyone
he was not only liked he was beloved by all who had anything to do with him
a more perfectly just and righteously dealing man said the family solicitor i have never had anything to do withnor one more punctual in the discharge of every business obligation
we shall miss him sadly the bishop wrote to joey in the very warmest terms
the poor were in consternation
the well's never missed said one old woman till it's dry and she only said what everyone else felt
ernest knew that the general regret was unaffected as for a loss which could not be easily repaired
he felt that there were only three people in the world who joined insincerely in the tribute of applause and these were the very three who could least show their want of sympathy
i mean joey charlotte and himself
he felt bitter against himself for being of a mind with either joey or charlotte upon any subject and thankful that he must conceal his being so as far as possible not because of anything his father had done to himthese grievances were too old to be remembered nowbut because he would never allow him to feel towards him as he was always trying to feel
as long as communication was confined to the merest commonplace all went well but if these were departed from ever such a little he invariably felt that his father's instincts showed themselves in immediate opposition to his own
when he was attacked his father laid whatever stress was possible on everything which his opponents said
if he met with any check his father was clearly pleased
what the old doctor had said about theobald's speaking ill of no man was perfectly true as regards others than himself but he knew very well that no one had injured his reputation in a quiet way so far as he dared to do more than his own father
this is a very common case and a very natural one
it often happens that if the son is right the father is wrong and the father is not going to have this if he can help it
it was very hard however to say what was the true root of the mischief in the present case
it was not ernest's having been imprisoned
theobald forgot all about that much sooner than nine fathers out of ten would have done
partly no doubt it was due to incompatibility of temperament but i believe the main ground of complaint lay in the fact that he had been so independent and so rich while still very young and that thus the old gentleman had been robbed of his power to tease and scratch in the way which he felt he was entitled to do
the love of teasing in a small way when he felt safe in doing so had remained part of his nature from the days when he told his nurse that he would keep her on purpose to torment her
i suppose it is so with all of us
at any rate i am sure that most fathers especially if they are clergymen are like theobald
he did not in reality i am convinced like joey or charlotte one whit better than he liked ernest
he did not like anyone or anything or if he liked anyone at all it was his butler who looked after him when he was not well and took great care of him and believed him to be the best and ablest man in the whole world
whether this faithful and attached servant continued to think this after theobald's will was opened and it was found what kind of legacy had been left him i know not
of his children the baby who had died at a day old was the only one whom he held to have treated him quite filially
as for christina he hardly ever pretended to miss her and never mentioned her name but this was taken as a proof that he felt her loss too keenly to be able ever to speak of her
it may have been so but i do not think it
theobald's effects were sold by auction and among them the harmony of the old and new testaments which he had compiled during many years with such exquisite neatness and a huge collection of ms sermonsbeing all in fact that he had ever written
these and the harmony fetched ninepence a barrow load
i was surprised to hear that joey had not given the three or four shillings which would have bought the whole lot but ernest tells me that joey was far fiercer in his dislike of his father than ever he had been himself and wished to get rid of everything that reminded him of him
it has already appeared that both joey and charlotte are married
joey has a family but he and ernest very rarely have any intercourse
of course ernest took nothing under his father's will this had long been understood so that the other two are both well provided for
charlotte is as clever as ever and sometimes asks ernest to come and stay with her and her husband near dover i suppose because she knows that the invitation will not be agreeable to him
there is a de haut en bas tone in all her letters it is rather hard to lay one's finger upon it but ernest never gets a letter from her without feeling that he is being written to by one who has had direct communication with an angel
what an awful creature he once said to me that angel must have been if it had anything to do with making charlotte what she is
could you like she wrote to him not long ago the thoughts of a little sea change here
the top of the cliffs will soon be bright with heather the gorse must be out already and the heather i should think begun to judge by the state of the hill at ewell and heather or no heatherthe cliffs are always beautiful and if you come your room shall be cosy so that you may have a resting corner to yourself
nineteen and sixpence is the price of a returnticket which covers a month
would you decide just as you would yourself like only if you come we would hope to try and make it bright for you but you must not feel it a burden on your mind if you feel disinclined to come in this direction
when i have a bad nightmare said ernest to me laughing as he showed me this letter i dream that i have got to stay with charlotte
her letters are supposed to be unusually well written and i believe it is said among the family that charlotte has far more real literary power than ernest has
sometimes we think that she is writing at him as much as to say there nowdon't you think you are the only one of us who can write read this
and if you want a telling bit of descriptive writing for your next book you can make what use of it you like
i daresay she writes very well but she has fallen under the dominion of the words hope think feel try bright and little and can hardly write a page without introducing all these words and some of them more than once
all this has the effect of making her style monotonous
ernest is as fond of music as ever perhaps more so and of late years has added musical composition to the other irons in his fire
he finds it still a little difficult and is in constant trouble through getting into the key of c sharp after beginning in the key of c and being unable to get back again
getting into the key of c sharp he said is like an unprotected female travelling on the metropolitan railway and finding herself at shepherd's bush without quite knowing where she wants to go to
how is she ever to get safe back to clapham junction
and clapham junction won't quite do either for clapham junction is like the diminished seventhsusceptible of such enharmonic change that you can resolve it into all the possible termini of music
talking of music reminds me of a little passage that took place between ernest and miss skinner dr skinner's eldest daughter not so very long ago
dr skinner had long left roughborough and had become dean of a cathedral in one of our midland countiesa position which exactly suited him
finding himself once in the neighbourhood ernest called for old acquaintance sake and was hospitably entertained at lunch
thirty years had whitened the doctor's bushy eyebrowshis hair they could not whiten
i believe that but for that wig he would have been made a bishop
his voice and manner were unchanged and when ernest remarking upon a plan of rome which hung in the hall spoke inadvertently of the quirinal he replied with all his wonted pomp yes the quirinalor as i myself prefer to call it the quirinal
after this triumph he inhaled a long breath through the corners of his mouth and flung it back again into the face of heaven as in his finest form during his headmastership
at lunch he did indeed once say next to impossible to think of anything else but he immediately corrected himself and substituted the words next to impossible to entertain irrelevant ideas after which he seemed to feel a good deal more comfortable
ernest saw the familiar volumes of dr skinner's works upon the bookshelves in the deanery diningroom but he saw no copy of rome or the biblewhich
and are you still as fond of music as ever mr pontifex
said miss skinner to ernest during the course of lunch
of some kinds of music yes miss skinner but you know i never did like modern music
isn't that rather dreadfuldon't you think you rathershe was going to have added ought to
but she left it unsaid feeling doubtless that she had sufficiently conveyed her meaning
i would like modern music if i could i have been trying all my life to like it but i succeed less and less the older i grow
and pray where do you consider modern music to begin
with sebastian bach
and don't you like beethoven
no i used to think i did when i was younger but i know now that i never really liked him
ah
how can you say so
you cannot understand him you never could say this if you understood him
for me a simple chord of beethoven is enough
this is happiness
ernest was amused at her strong family likeness to her fathera likeness which had grown upon her as she had become older and which extended even to voice and manner of speaking
he remembered how he had heard me describe the game of chess i had played with the doctor in days gone by and with his mind's ear seemed to hear miss skinner saying as though it were an epitaph     stay    i may presently take    a simple chord of beethoven    or a small semiquaver    from one of mendelssohn's songs without words
after luncheon when ernest was left alone for half an hour or so with the dean he plied him so well with compliments that the old gentleman was pleased and flattered beyond his wont
he rose and bowed
these expressions he said voce sua are very valuable to me
they are but a small part sir rejoined ernest of what anyone of your old pupils must feel towards you and the pair danced as it were a minuet at the end of the diningroom table in front of the old bay window that looked upon the smooth shaven lawn
on this ernest departed but a few days afterwards the doctor wrote him a letter and told him that his critics were a greek text and at the same time greek text
ernest remembered greek text and knew that the other words were something of like nature so it was all right
a month or two afterwards dr skinner was gathered to his fathers
he was an old fool ernest said i and you should not relent towards him
i could not help it he replied he was so old that it was almost like playing with a child
sometimes like all whose minds are active ernest overworks himself and then occasionally he has fierce and reproachful encounters with dr skinner or theobald in his sleepbut beyond this neither of these two worthies can now molest him further
to myself he has been a son and more than a son at times i am half afraidas for example when i talk to him about his booksthat i may have been to him more like a father than i ought if i have i trust he has forgiven me
his books are the only bone of contention between us
i want him to write like other people and not to offend so many of his readers he says he can no more change his manner of writing than the colour of his hair and that he must write as he does or not at all
with the public generally he is not a favourite
he is admitted to have talent but it is considered generally to be of a queer unpractical kind and no matter how serious he is he is always accused of being in jest
his first book was a success for reasons which i have already explained but none of his others have been more than creditable failures
he is one of those unfortunate men each one of whose books is sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out but becomes excellent reading as soon as it has been followed by a later work which may in its turn be condemned
he never asked a reviewer to dinner in his life
i have told him over and over again that this is madness and find that this is the only thing i can say to him which makes him angry with me
what can it matter to me he says whether people read my books or not
it may matter to thembut i have too much money to want more and if the books have any stuff in them it will work byandby
i do not know nor greatly care whether they are good or not
what opinion can any sane man form about his own work
some people must write stupid books just as there must be junior ops and third class poll men
why should i complain of being among the mediocrities
if a man is not absolutely below mediocrity let him be thankfulbesides the books will have to stand by themselves some day so the sooner they begin the better
i spoke to his publisher about him not long since
mr pontifex he said is a homo unius libri but it doesn't do to tell him so
i could see the publisher who ought to know had lost all faith in ernest's literary position and looked upon him as a man whose failure was all the more hopeless for the fact of his having once made a coup
he is in a very solitary position mr overton continued the publisher
he has formed no alliances and has made enemies not only of the religious world but of the literary and scientific brotherhood as well
this will not do nowadays
if a man wishes to get on he must belong to a set and mr pontifex belongs to no setnot even to a club
i replied mr pontifex is the exact likeness of othello but with a differencehe hates not wisely but too well
he would dislike the literary and scientific swells if he were to come to know them and they him there is no natural solidarity between him and them and if he were brought into contact with them his last state would be worse than his first
his instinct tells him this so he keeps clear of them and attacks them whenever he thinks they deserve itin the hope perhaps that a younger generation will listen to him more willingly than the present
can anything' said the publisher be conceived more impracticable and imprudent
to all this ernest replies with one word onlywait
such is my friend's latest development
he would not it is true run much chance at present of trying to found a college of spiritual pathology but i must leave the reader to determine whether there is not a strong family likeness between the ernest of the college of spiritual pathology and the ernest who will insist on addressing the next generation rather than his own
he says he trusts that there is not and takes the sacrament duly once a year as a sop to nemesis lest he should again feel strongly upon any subject
it rather fatigues him but no man's opinions he sometimes says can be worth holding unless he knows how to deny them easily and gracefully upon occasion in the cause of charity
in politics he is a conservative so far as his vote and interest are concerned
in all other respects he is an advanced radical
his father and grandfather could probably no more understand his state of mind than they could understand chinese but those who know him intimately do not know that they wish him greatly different from what he actually is
