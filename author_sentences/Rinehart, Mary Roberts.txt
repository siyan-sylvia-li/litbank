the odds and ends     i take a country house   this is the story of how a middleaged spinster lost her mind deserted her domestic gods in the city took a furnished house for the summer out of town and found herself involved in one of those mysterious crimes that keep our newspapers and detective agencies happy and prosperous
for twenty years i had been perfectly comfortable for twenty years i had had the windowboxes filled in the spring the carpets lifted the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown linen for as many summers i had said goodby to my friends and after watching their perspiring hegira had settled down to a delicious quiet in town where the mail comes three times a day and the water supply does not depend on a tank on the roof
and thenthe madness seized me
when i look back over the months i spent at sunnyside i wonder that i survived at all
as it is i show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences
i have turned very grayliddy reminded me of it only yesterday by saying that a little bluing in the rinsewater would make my hair silvery instead of a yellowish white
i hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and i snapped her off
no i said sharply im not going to use bluing at my time of life or starch either  liddys nerves are gone she says since that awful summer but she has enough left goodness knows
and when she begins to go around with a lump in her throat all i have to do is to threaten to return to sunnyside and she is frightened into a semblance of cheerfulnessfrom which you may judge that the summer there was anything but a success
the newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incompleteone of them mentioned me but once and then only as the tenant at the time the thing happenedthat i feel it my due to tell what i know
mr jamieson the detective said himself he could never have done without me although he gave me little enough credit in print
i shall have to go back several yearsthirteen to be exactto start my story
at that time my brother died leaving me his two children
halsey was eleven then and gertrude was seven
all the responsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly to perfect the profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the child has lived like the man who started to carry the calf and ended by walking along with the bull on his shoulders
however i did the best i could
when gertrude got past the hairribbon age and halsey asked for a scarfpin and put on long trousersand a wonderful help that was to the darningi sent them away to good schools
after that my responsibility was chiefly postal with three months every summer in which to replenish their wardrobes look over their lists of acquaintances and generally to take my fostermotherhood out of its nine months retirement in camphor
i missed the summers with them when somewhat later at boardingschool and college the children spent much of their vacations with friends
gradually i found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter though i wrote them at stated intervals
but when halsey had finished his electrical course and gertrude her boardingschool and both came home to stay things were suddenly changed
the winter gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of sitting up late at night to bring her home from things taking her to the dressmakers between naps the next day and discouraging ineligible youths with either more money than brains or more brains than money
also i acquired a great many things to say lingerie for undergarments frocks and gowns instead of dresses and that beardless sophomores are not college boys but college men
halsey required less personal supervision and as they both got their mothers fortune that winter my responsibility became purely moral
halsey bought a car of course and i learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray baize veil and after a time never to stop to look at the dogs one has run down
people are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs
the additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt and by spring i was quite tractable
so when halsey suggested camping in the adirondacks and gertrude wanted bar harbor we compromised on a good country house with links near within motor distance of town and telephone distance of the doctor
that was how we went to sunnyside
we went out to inspect the property and it seemed to deserve its name
its cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of the ordinary
only one thing seemed unusual to me the housekeeper who had been left in charge had moved from the house to the gardeners lodge a few days before
as the lodge was far enough away from the house it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction undisturbed
the property was an extensive one the house on the top of a hill which sloped away in great stretches of green lawn and clipped hedges to the road and across the valley perhaps a couple of miles away was the greenwood club house
gertrude and halsey were infatuated
why its everything you want halsey said view air good water and good roads
as for the house its big enough for a hospital if it has a queen anne front and a mary anne back which was ridiculous it was pure elizabethan
of course we took the place it was not my idea of comfort being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question serious
but i give myself credit for this whatever has happened since i never blamed halsey and gertrude for taking me there
and another thing if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else it taught me one thingthat somehow somewhere from perhaps a halfcivilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his food or his prey i have in me the instinct of the chase
were i a man i should be a trapper of criminals trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar
but being an unmarried woman with the handicap of my sex my first acquaintance with crime will probably be my last
indeed it came near enough to being my last acquaintance with anything
the property was owned by paul armstrong the president of the traders bank who at the time we took the house was in the west with his wife and daughter and a doctor walker the armstrong family physician
halsey knew louise armstronghad been rather attentive to her the winter before but as halsey was always attentive to somebody i had not thought of it seriously although she was a charming girl
i knew of mr armstrong only through his connection with the bank where the childrens money was largely invested and through an ugly story about the son arnold armstrong who was reported to have forged his fathers name for a considerable amount to some bank paper
however the story had had no interest for me
i cleared halsey and gertrude away to a house party and moved out to sunnyside the first of may
the roads were bad but the trees were in leaf and there were still tulips in the borders around the house
the arbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves and on the way from the station a short mile while the car stuck in the mud i found a bank showered with tiny forgetmenots
the birdsdont ask me what kind they all look alike to me unless they have a hall mark of some bright colorthe birds were chirping in the hedges and everything breathed of peace
liddy who was born and bred on a brick pavement got a little bit downspirited when the crickets began to chirp or scrape their legs together or whatever it is they do at twilight
the first night passed quietly enough
i have always been grateful for that one nights peace it shows what the country might be under favorable circumstances
never after that night did i put my head on my pillow with any assurance how long it would be there or on my shoulders for that matter
on the following morning liddy and mrs ralston my own housekeeper had a difference of opinion and mrs ralston left on the eleven train
just after luncheon burke the butler was taken unexpectedly with a pain in his right side much worse when i was within hearing distance and by afternoon he was started cityward
that night the cooks sister had a babythe cook seeing indecision in my face made it twins on second thoughtand to be short by noon the next day the household staff was down to liddy and myself
and this in a house with twentytwo rooms and five baths
liddy wanted to go back to the city at once but the milkboy said that thomas johnson the armstrongs colored butler was working as a waiter at the greenwood club and might come back
i have the usual scruples about coercing peoples servants away but few of us have any conscience regarding institutions or corporationswitness the way we beat railroads and streetcar companies when we canso i called up the club and about eight oclock thomas johnson came to see me
poor thomas
well it ended by my engaging thomas on the spot at outrageous wages and with permission to sleep in the gardeners lodge empty since the house was rented
the old manhe was whitehaired and a little stooped but with an immense idea of his personal dignitygave me his reasons hesitatingly
i aint sayin nothin mis innes he said with his hand on the doorknob but theres been goinson here this las few months as aint natchal
taint one thing an taint anotherits jest a door squealin here an a winder closin there but when doors an winders gets to cuttin up capers and theres nobody nigh em its time thomas johnson sleeps somewhars else  liddy who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me that night and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a place screamed a little and turned a yellowgreen
but i am not easily alarmed
it was entirely in vain i represented to thomas that we were alone and that he would have to stay in the house that night
he was politely firm but he would come over early the next morning and if i gave him a key he would come in time to get some sort of breakfast
i stood on the huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive with mingled feelingsirritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at getting him at all
i am not ashamed to say that i doublelocked the hall door when i went in
you can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed liddy i said severely
you give me the creeps standing there
a woman of your age ought to have better sense it usually braces liddy to mention her age she owns to fortywhich is absurd
her mother cooked for my grandfather and liddy must be at least as old as i
but that night she refused to brace
youre not going to ask me to lock up miss rachel she quavered
why theres a dozen french windows in the drawingroom and the billiardroom wing and every one opens on a porch
and mary anne said that last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked the kitchen door  mary anne was a fool i said sternly
if there had been a man there she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding him what was left from dinner inside of an hour from force of habit
now dont be ridiculous
lock up the house and go to bed
i am going to read   illustration  but liddy set her lips tight and stood still
im not going to bed she said
i am going to pack up and tomorrow i am going to leave  youll do nothing of the sort i snapped
liddy and i often desire to part company but never at the same time
if you are afraid i will go with you but for goodness sake dont try to hide behind me  the house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale
wherever possible on the first floor the architect had done away with partitions using arches and columns instead
the effect was cool and spacious but scarcely cozy
as liddy and i went from one window to another our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably
there was plenty of lightthe electric plant down in the village supplied usbut there were long vistas of polished floor and mirrors which reflected us from unexpected corners until i felt some of liddys foolishness communicate itself to me
the house was very long a rectangle in general form with the main entrance in the center of the long side
the brickpaved entry opened into a short hall to the right of which separated only by a row of pillars was a huge livingroom
beyond that was the drawingroom and in the end the billiardroom
off the billiardroom in the extreme right wing was a den or cardroom with a small hall opening on the east veranda and from there went up a narrow circular staircase
halsey had pointed it out with delight
just look aunt rachel he said with a flourish
the architect that put up this joint was wise to a few things
arnold armstrong and his friends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed in the early morning without having the family send in a police call  liddy and i got as far as the cardroom and turned on all the lights
i tried the small entry door there which opened on the veranda and examined the windows
everything was secure and liddy a little less nervous now had just pointed out to me the disgracefully dusty condition of the hardwood floor when suddenly the lights went out
we waited a moment i think liddy was stunned with fright or she would have screamed
and then i clutched her by the arm and pointed to one of the windows opening on the porch
the sudden change threw the window into relief an oblong of grayish light and showed us a figure standing close peering in
as i looked it darted across the veranda and out of sight in the darkness
a link cuffbutton   liddys knees seemed to give away under her
without a sound she sank down leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement
liddy began to moan under her breath and in my excitement i reached down and shook her
stop it i whispered
its only a womanmaybe a maid of the armstrongs
get up and help me find the door she groaned again
very well i said then ill have to leave you here
im going  she moved at that and holding to my sleeve we felt our way with numerous collisions to the billiardroom and from there to the drawingroom
the lights came on then and with the long french windows unshuttered i had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a peering face
in fact in the light of what happened afterward i am pretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly evening
we hurried over the rest of the lockingup and got upstairs as quickly as we could
i left the lights all on and our footsteps echoed cavernously
liddy had a stiff neck the next morning from looking back over her shoulder and she refused to go to bed
let me stay in your dressingroom miss rachel she begged
if you dont ill sit in the hall outside the door
im not going to be murdered with my eyes shut  if youre going to be murdered i retorted it wont make any difference whether they are shut or open
but you may stay in the dressingroom if you will lie on the couch when you sleep in a chair you snore  she was too far gone to be indignant but after a while she came to the door and looked in to where i was composing myself for sleep with drummonds spiritual life
that wasnt a woman miss rachel she said with her shoes in her hand
it was a man in a long coat  what woman was a man i discouraged her without looking up and she went back to the couch
it was eleven oclock when i finally prepared for bed
in spite of my assumption of indifference i locked the door into the hall and finding the transom did not catch i put a chair cautiously before the doorit was not necessary to rouse liddyand climbing up put on the ledge of the transom a small dressingmirror so that any movement of the frame would send it crashing down
then secure in my precautions i went to bed
i did not go to sleep at once
liddy disturbed me just as i was growing drowsy by coming in and peering under the bed
she was afraid to speak however because of her previous snubbing and went back stopping in the doorway to sigh dismally
somewhere downstairs a clock with a chime sang away the hourseleventhirty fortyfive twelve
and then the lights went out to stay
the casanova electric company shuts up shop and goes home to bed at midnight when one has a party i believe it is customary to fee the company which will drink hot coffee and keep awake a couple of hours longer
but the lights were gone for good that night
liddy had gone to sleep as i knew she would
she was a very unreliable person always awake and ready to talk when she wasnt wanted and dozing off to sleep when she was
i called her once or twice the only result being an explosive snore that threatened her very windpipethen i got up and lighted a bedroom candle
my bedroom and dressing room were above the big livingroom on the first floor
on the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the house with rooms opening from both sides
in the wings were small corridors crossing the main onethe plan was simplicity itself
and just as i got back into bed i heard a sound from the east wing apparently that made me stop frozen with one bedroom slipper half off and listen
it was a rattling metallic sound and it reverberated along the empty halls like the crash of doom
it was for all the world as if something heavy perhaps a piece of steel had rolled clattering and jangling down the hardwood stairs leading to the cardroom
in the silence that followed liddy stirred and snored again
i was exasperated first she kept me awake by silly alarms then when she was needed she slept like joe jefferson or ripthey are always the same to me
i went in and aroused her and i give her credit for being wide awake the minute i spoke
get up i said if you dont want to be murdered in your bed  where
how she yelled vociferously and jumped up
theres somebody in the house i said
get up
well have to get to the telephone  not out in the hall she gasped oh miss rachel not out in the hall trying to hold me back
but i am a large woman and liddy is small
we got to the door somehow and liddy held a brass andiron which it was all she could do to lift let alone brain anybody with
i listened and hearing nothing opened the door a little and peered into the hall
it was a black void full of terrible suggestion and my candle only emphasized the gloom
liddy squealed and drew me back again and as the door slammed the mirror i had put on the transom came down and hit her on the head
that completed our demoralization
it was some time before i could persuade her she had not been attacked from behind by a burglar and when she found the mirror smashed on the floor she wasnt much better
theres going to be a death she wailed
oh miss rachel theres going to be a death  there will be i said grimly if you dont keep quiet liddy allen  and so we sat there until morning wondering if the candle would last until dawn and arranging what trains we could take back to town
if we had only stuck to that decision and gone back before it was too late
the sun came finally and from my window i watched the trees along the drive take shadowy form gradually lose their ghostlike appearance become gray and then green
the greenwood club showed itself a dab of white against the hill across the valley and an early robin or two hopped around in the dew
not until the milkboy and the sun came about the same time did i dare to open the door into the hall and look around
everything was as we had left it
trunks were heaped here and there ready for the trunkroom and through an end window of stained glass came a streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently cheerful
the milkboy was pounding somewhere below and the day had begun
thomas johnson came ambling up the drive about halfpast six and we could hear him clattering around on the lower floor opening shutters
i had to take liddy to her room upstairs howevershe was quite sure she would find something uncanny
in fact when she did not having now the courage of daylight she was actually disappointed
well we did not go back to town that day
the discovery of a small picture fallen from the wall of the drawingroom was quite sufficient to satisfy liddy that the alarm had been a false one but i was anything but convinced
allowing for my nerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves at night there was still no possibility that the picture had made the series of sounds i heard
to prove it however i dropped it again
it fell with a single muffled crash of its wooden frame and incidentally ruined itself beyond repair
i justified myself by reflecting that if the armstrongs chose to leave pictures in unsafe positions and to rent a house with a family ghost the destruction of property was their responsibility not mine
i warned liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody and telephoned to town for servants
then after a breakfast which did more credit to thomas heart than his head i went on a short tour of investigation
the sounds had come from the east wing and not without some qualms i began there
at first i found nothing
since then i have developed my powers of observation but at that time i was a novice
the small cardroom seemed undisturbed
i looked for footprints which is i believe the conventional thing to do although my experience has been that as clues both footprints and thumbmarks are more useful in fiction than in fact
but the stairs in that wing offered something
at the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker hamper packed with linen that had come from town
it stood at the edge of the top step almost barring passage and on the step below it was a long fresh scratch
for three steps the scratch was repeated gradually diminishing as if some object had fallen striking each one
then for four steps nothing
on the fifth step below was a round dent in the hard wood
that was all and it seemed little enough except that i was positive the marks had not been there the day before
it bore out my theory of the sound which had been for all the world like the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of steps
the four steps had been skipped
i reasoned that an iron bar for instance would do something of the sortstrike two or three steps end down then turn over jumping a few stairs and landing with a thud
iron bars however do not fall downstairs in the middle of the night alone
coupled with the figure on the veranda the agency by which it climbed might be assumed
butand here was the thing that puzzled me mostthe doors were all fastened that morning the windows unmolested and the particular door from the cardroom to the veranda had a combination lock of which i held the key and which had not been tampered with
i fixed on an attempt at burglary as the most natural explanationan attempt frustrated by the falling of the object whatever it was that had roused me
two things i could not understand how the intruder had escaped with everything locked and why he had left the small silver which in the absence of a butler had remained downstairs over night
under pretext of learning more about the place thomas johnson led me through the house and the cellars without result
everything was in good order and repair money had been spent lavishly on construction and plumbing
the house was full of conveniences and i had no reason to repent my bargain save the fact that in the nature of things night must come again
and other nights must followand we were a long way from a policestation
in the afternoon a hack came up from casanova with a fresh relay of servants
the driver took them with a flourish to the servants entrance and drove around to the front of the house where i was awaiting him
two dollars he said in reply to my question
i dont charge full rates because bringin em up all summer as i do it pays to make a special price
when they got off the train i sez sez i theres another bunch for sunnyside cook parlor maid and all yesmsix summers and a new lot never less than once a month
they wont stand for the country and the lonesomeness i reckon  but with the presence of the bunch of servants my courage revived and late in the afternoon came a message from gertrude that she and halsey would arrive that night at about eleven oclock coming in the car from richfield
things were looking up and when beulah my cat a most intelligent animal found some early catnip on a bank near the house and rolled in it in a feline ecstasy i decided that getting back to nature was the thing to do
while i was dressing for dinner liddy rapped at the door
she was hardly herself yet but privately i think she was worrying about the broken mirror and its augury more than anything else
when she came in she was holding something in her hand and she laid it on the dressingtable carefully
i found it in the linen hamper she said
it must be mr halseys but it seems queer how it got there  it was the half of a link cuffbutton of unique design and i looked at it carefully
where was it
in the bottom of the hamper i asked
on the very top she replied
its a mercy it didnt fall out on the way  when liddy had gone i examined the fragment attentively
i had never seen it before and i was certain it was not halseys
it was of italian workmanship and consisted of a motherofpearl foundation encrusted with tiny seedpearls strung on horsehair to hold them
in the center was a small ruby
the trinket was odd enough but not intrinsically of great value
its interest for me lay in this liddy had found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the eastwing stairs
that afternoon the armstrongs housekeeper a youngish goodlooking woman applied for mrs ralstons place and i was glad enough to take her
she looked as though she might be equal to a dozen of liddy with her snapping black eyes and heavy jaw
her name was anne watson and i dined that evening for the first time in three days
mr john bailey appears   i had dinner served in the breakfastroom
somehow the huge diningroom depressed me and thomas cheerful enough all day allowed his spirits to go down with the sun
he had a habit of watching the corners of the room left shadowy by the candles on the table and altogether it was not a festive meal
dinner over i went into the livingroom
i had three hours before the children could possibly arrive and i got out my knitting
i had brought along two dozen pairs of slipper soles in assorted sizesi always send knitted slippers to the old ladies home at christmasand now i sorted over the wools with a grim determination not to think about the night before
but my mind was not on my work at the end of a halfhour i found i had put a row of blue scallops on eliza klinefelters lavender slippers and i put them away
i got out the cufflink and went with it to the pantry
thomas was wiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke
i sniffed and looked around but there was no pipe to be seen
thomas i said you have been smoking  no mam he was injured innocence itself
its on my coat mam
over at the club the gentlemen  but thomas did not finish
the pantry was suddenly filled with the odor of singeing cloth
thomas gave a clutch at his coat whirled to the sink filled a tumbler with water and poured it into his right pocket with the celerity of practice
thomas i said when he was sheepishly mopping the floor smoking is a filthy and injurious habit
if you must smoke you must but dont stick a lighted pipe in your pocket again
your skins your own you can blister it if you like
but this house is not mine and i dont want a conflagration
did you ever see this cufflink before  no he never had he said but he looked at it oddly
i picked it up in the hall i added indifferently
the old mans eyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows
theres strange goinson here mis innes he said shaking his head
somethins goin to happen sure
you aint took notice that the big clock in the hall is stopped i reckon  nonsense i said
clocks have to stop dont they if theyre not wound  its wound up all right and it stopped at three oclock last night he answered solemnly
moren that that there clock aint stopped for fifteen years not since mr armstrongs first wife died
and that aint allno mam
last three nights i slep in this place after the electrics went out i had a token
my oil lamp was full of oil but it kep goin out do what i would
minute i shet my eyes out that lampd go
there aint no surer token of death
the bible sez let yer light shine when a hand you cant see puts yer light out it means death sure  the old mans voice was full of conviction
in spite of myself i had a chilly sensation in the small of my back and i left him mumbling over his dishes
later on i heard a crash from the pantry and liddy reported that beulah who is coal black had darted in front of thomas just as he picked up a tray of dishes that the bad omen had been too much for him and he had dropped the tray
the chug of the automobile as it climbed the hill was the most welcome sound i had heard for a long time and with gertrude and halsey actually before me my troubles seemed over for good
gertrude stood smiling in the hall with her hat quite over one ear and her hair in every direction under her pink veil
gertrude is a very pretty girl no matter how her hat is and i was not surprised when halsey presented a goodlooking young man who bowed at me and looked at trudethat is the ridiculous nickname gertrude brought from school
i have brought a guest aunt ray halsey said
i want you to adopt him into your affections and your saturdaytomonday list
let me present john bailey only you must call him jack
in twelve hours hell be calling you aunt i know him  we shook hands and i got a chance to look at mr bailey he was a tall fellow perhaps thirty and he wore a small mustache
i remember wondering why he seemed to have a good mouth and when he smiled his teeth were above the average
one never knows why certain men cling to a messy upper lip that must get into things any more than one understands some women building up their hair on wire atrocities
otherwise he was very good to look at stalwart and tanned with the direct gaze that i like
i am particular about mr bailey because he was a prominent figure in what happened later
gertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very soon
i made up my mind to tell them nothing until the next day and then to make as light of our excitement as possible
after all what had i to tell
an inquisitive face peering in at a window a crash in the night a scratch or two on the stairs and half a cuffbutton
as for thomas and his forebodings it was always my belief that a negro is one part thief one part pigment and the rest superstition
it was saturday night
the two men went to the billiardroom and i could hear them talking as i went upstairs
it seemed that halsey had stopped at the greenwood club for gasolene and found jack bailey there with the sunday golf crowd
mr bailey had not been hard to persuadeprobably gertrude knew whyand they had carried him off triumphantly
i roused liddy to get them something to eatthomas was beyond reach in the lodgeand paid no attention to her evident terror of the kitchen regions
then i went to bed
the men were still in the billiardroom when i finally dozed off and the last thing i remember was the howl of a dog in front of the house
it wailed a crescendo of woe that trailed off hopefully only to break out afresh from a new point of the compass
at three oclock in the morning i was roused by a revolver shot
the sound seemed to come from just outside my door
for a moment i could not move
theni heard gertrude stirring in her room and the next moment she had thrown open the connecting door
o aunt ray
aunt ray she cried hysterically
some one has been killed killed  thieves i said shortly
thank goodness there are some men in the house tonight i was getting into my slippers and a bathrobe and gertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp
then we opened the door into the hall where crowded on the upper landing of the stairs the maids whitefaced and trembling were peering down headed by liddy
i was greeted by a series of low screams and questions and i tried to quiet them
gertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering
i went at once across the hall to halseys room and knocked then i pushed the door open
it was empty the bed had not been occupied
he must be in mr baileys room i said excitedly and followed by liddy we went there
like halseys it had not been occupied
gertrude was on her feet now but she leaned against the door for support
they have been killed she gasped
then she caught me by the arm and dragged me toward the stairs
they may only be hurt and we must find them she said her eyes dilated with excitement
i dont remember how we got down the stairs i do remember expecting every moment to be killed
the cook was at the telephone upstairs calling the greenwood club and liddy was behind me afraid to come and not daring to stay behind
we found the livingroom and the drawingroom undisturbed
somehow i felt that whatever we found would be in the cardroom or on the staircase and nothing but the fear that halsey was in danger drove me on with every step my knees seemed to give way under me
gertrude was ahead and in the cardroom she stopped holding her candle high
then she pointed silently to the doorway into the hall beyond
huddled there on the floor face down with his arms extended was a man
gertrude ran forward with a gasping sob
jack she cried oh jack  liddy had run screaming and the two of us were there alone
it was gertrude who turned him over finally until we could see his white face and then she drew a deep breath and dropped limply to her knees
it was the body of a man a gentleman in a dinner coat and white waistcoat stained now with bloodthe body of a man i had never seen before
where is halsey
gertrude gazed at the face in a kind of fascination
then she put out her hands blindly and i thought she was going to faint
he has killed him she muttered almost inarticulately and at that because my nerves were going i gave her a good shake
what do you mean i said frantically
there was a depth of grief and conviction in her tone that was worse than anything she could have said
the shake braced her anyhow and she seemed to pull herself together
but not another word would she say she stood gazing down at that gruesome figure on the floor while liddy ashamed of her flight and afraid to come back alone drove before her three terrified womenservants into the drawingroom which was as near as any of them would venture
once in the drawingroom gertrude collapsed and went from one fainting spell into another
i had all i could do to keep liddy from drowning her with cold water and the maids huddled in a corner as much use as so many sheep
in a short time although it seemed hours a car came rushing up and anne watson who had waited to dress opened the door
three men from the greenwood club in all kinds of costumes hurried in
i recognized a mr jarvis but the others were strangers
whats wrong the jarvis man askedand we made a strange picture no doubt
nobody hurt is there he was looking at gertrude
worse than that mr jarvis i said
i think it is murder  at the word there was a commotion
the cook began to cry and mrs watson knocked over a chair
the men were visibly impressed
not any member of the family mr jarvis asked when he had got his breath
no i said and motioning liddy to look after gertrude i led the way with a lamp to the cardroom door
one of the men gave an exclamation and they all hurried across the room
mr jarvis took the lamp from mei remember thatand then feeling myself getting dizzy and lightheaded i closed my eyes
when i opened them their brief examination was over and mr jarvis was trying to put me in a chair
you must get upstairs he said firmly you and miss gertrude too
this has been a terrible shock
in his own home too  i stared at him without comprehension
who is it i asked with difficulty
there was a band drawn tight around my throat
it is arnold armstrong he said looking at me oddly and he has been murdered in his fathers house  after a minute i gathered myself together and mr jarvis helped me into the livingroom
liddy had got gertrude upstairs and the two strange men from the club stayed with the body
the reaction from the shock and strain was tremendous i was collapsedand then mr jarvis asked me a question that brought back my wandering faculties
where is halsey he asked
halsey suddenly gertrudes stricken face rose before me the empty rooms upstairs
where was halsey
he was here wasnt he mr jarvis persisted
he stopped at the club on his way over  idont know where he is i said feebly
one of the men from the club came in asked for the telephone and i could hear him excitedly talking saying something about coroners and detectives
mr jarvis leaned over to me
why dont you trust me miss innes he said
if i can do anything i will
but tell me the whole thing  i did finally from the beginning and when i told of jack baileys being in the house that night he gave a long whistle
i wish they were both here he said when i finished
whatever mad prank took them away it would look better if they were here
especially  especially what  especially since jack bailey and arnold armstrong were notoriously bad friends
it was bailey who got arnold into trouble last springsomething about the bank
and then too  go on i said
if there is anything more i ought to know  theres nothing more he said evasively
theres just one thing we may bank on miss innes
any court in the country will acquit a man who kills an intruder in his house at night
if halsey  why you dont think halsey did it i exclaimed
there was a queer feeling of physical nausea coming over me
no no not at all he said with forced cheerfulness
come miss innes youre a ghost of yourself and i am going to help you upstairs and call your maid
this has been too much for you  liddy helped me back to bed and under the impression that i was in danger of freezing to death put a hotwater bottle over my heart and another at my feet
then she left me
it was early dawn now and from voices under my window i surmised that mr jarvis and his companions were searching the grounds
as for me i lay in bed with every faculty awake
where had halsey gone
how had he gone and when
before the murder no doubt but who would believe that
if either he or jack bailey had heard an intruder in the house and shot himas they might have been justified in doingwhy had they run away
the whole thing was unheard of outrageous andimpossible to ignore
about six oclock gertrude came in
she was fully dressed and i sat up nervously
poor aunty she said
what a shocking night you have had she came over and sat down on the bed and i saw she looked very tired and worn
is there anything new i asked anxiously
nothing
the car is gone but warnerhe is the chauffeurwarner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it  well i said if i ever get my hands on halsey innes i shall not let go until i have told him a few things
when we get this cleared up i am going back to the city to be quiet
one more night like the last two will end me
the peace of the countryfiddle sticks  whereupon i told gertrude of the noises the night before and the figure on the veranda in the east wing
as an afterthought i brought out the pearl cufflink
i have no doubt now i said that it was arnold armstrong the night before last too
he had a key no doubt but why he should steal into his fathers house i can not imagine
he could have come with my permission easily enough
anyhow whoever it was that night left this little souvenir  gertrude took one look at the cufflink and went as white as the pearls in it she clutched at the foot of the bed and stood staring
as for me i was quite as astonished as she was
where didyoufind it she asked finally with a desperate effort at calm
and while i told her she stood looking out of the window with a look i could not fathom on her face
it was a relief when mrs watson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast
the cook was in bed completely demoralized she reported and liddy brave with the daylight was looking for footprints around the house
mrs watson herself was a wreck she was bluewhite around the lips and she had one hand tied up
she said she had fallen downstairs in her excitement
it was natural of course that the thing would shock her having been the armstrongs housekeeper for several years and knowing mr arnold well
gertrude had slipped out during my talk with mrs watson and i dressed and went downstairs
the billiard and cardrooms were locked until the coroner and the detectives got there and the men from the club had gone back for more conventional clothing
i could hear thomas in the pantry alternately wailing for mr arnold as he called him and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder
the house seemed to choke me and slipping a shawl around me i went out on the drive
at the corner by the east wing i met liddy
her skirts were draggled with dew to her knees and her hair was still in crimps
go right in and change your clothes i said sharply
youre a sight and at your age  she had a golfstick in her hand and she said she had found it on the lawn
there was nothing unusual about it but it occurred to me that a golfstick with a metal end might have been the object that had scratched the stairs near the cardroom
i took it from her and sent her up for dry garments
her daylight courage and selfimportance and her shuddering delight in the mystery irritated me beyond words
after i left her i made a circuit of the building
nothing seemed to be disturbed the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun as it had the day i had been coerced into taking it
there was nothing to show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death
in one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was pecking viciously at something that glittered in the light
i picked my way gingerly over through the dew and stooped down almost buried in the soft ground was a revolver
i scraped the earth off it with the tip of my shoe and picking it up slipped it into my pocket
not until i had got into my bedroom and doublelocked the door did i venture to take it out and examine it
one look was all i needed
it was halseys revolver
i had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shavingstand and there could be no mistake
his name was on a small silver plate on the handle
i seemed to see a network closing around my boy innocent as i knew he was
the revolveri am afraid of them but anxiety gave me courage to look through the barrelthe revolver had still two bullets in it
i could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that i had found the revolver before any sharpeyed detective had come around
i decided to keep what clues i had the cufflink the golfstick and the revolver in a secure place until i could see some reason for displaying them
the cufflink had been dropped into a little filigree box on my toilet table
i opened the box and felt around for it
the box was emptythe cufflink had disappeared
gertrudes engagement   at ten oclock the casanova hack brought up three men
they introduced themselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from the city
the coroner led the way at once to the locked wing and with the aid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body
the other detective after a short scrutiny of the dead man busied himself with the outside of the house
it was only after they had got a fair idea of things as they were that they sent for me
i received them in the livingroom and i had made up my mind exactly what to tell
i had taken the house for the summer i said while the armstrongs were in california
in spite of a rumor among the servants about strange noisesi cited thomasnothing had occurred the first two nights
on the third night i believed that some one had been in the house i had heard a crashing sound but being alone with one maid had not investigated
the house had been locked in the morning and apparently undisturbed
then as clearly as i could i related how the night before a shot had roused us that my niece and i had investigated and found a body that i did not know who the murdered man was until mr jarvis from the club informed me and that i knew of no reason why mr arnold armstrong should steal into his fathers house at night
i should have been glad to allow him entree there at any time
have you reason to believe miss innes the coroner asked that any member of your household imagining mr armstrong was a burglar shot him in selfdefense  i have no reason for thinking so i said quietly
your theory is that mr armstrong was followed here by some enemy and shot as he entered the house  i dont think i have a theory i said
the thing that has puzzled me is why mr armstrong should enter his fathers house two nights in succession stealing in like a thief when he needed only to ask entrance to be admitted  the coroner was a very silent man he took some notes after this but he seemed anxious to make the next train back to town
he set the inquest for the following saturday gave mr jamieson the younger of the two detectives and the more intelligent looking a few instructions and after gravely shaking hands with me and regretting the unfortunate affair took his departure accompanied by the other detective
i was just beginning to breathe freely when mr jamieson who had been standing by the window came over to me
the family consists of yourself alone miss innes  my niece is here i said
there is no one but yourself and your niece  my nephew i had to moisten my lips
oh a nephew
i should like to see him if he is here  he is not here just now i said as quietly as i could
i expect himat any time  he was here yesterday evening i believe  noyes  didnt he have a guest with him
another man  he brought a friend with him to stay over sunday mr bailey  mr
john bailey the cashier of the traders bank i believe and i knew that some one at the greenwood club had told
when did they leave  very earlyi dont know at just what time  mr jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me
please try to be more explicit he said
you say your nephew and mr bailey were in the house last night and yet you and your niece with some womenservants found the body
where was your nephew  i was entirely desperate by that time
i do not know i cried but be sure of this halsey knows nothing of this thing and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an innocent man guilty  sit down he said pushing forward a chair
there are some things i have to tell you and in return please tell me all you know
believe me things always come out
in the first place mr armstrong was shot from above
the bullet was fired at close range entered below the shoulder and came out after passing through the heart well down the back
in other words i believe the murderer stood on the stairs and fired down
in the second place i found on the edge of the billiardtable a charred cigar which had burned itself partly out and a cigarette which had consumed itself to the cork tip
neither one had been more than lighted then put down and forgotten
have you any idea what it was that made your nephew and mr bailey leave their cigars and their game take out the automobile without calling the chauffeur and all this atlet me seecertainly before three oclock in the morning  i dont know i said but depend on it mr jamieson halsey will be back himself to explain everything  i sincerely hope so he said
miss innes has it occurred to you that mr bailey might know something of this  gertrude had come downstairs and just as he spoke she came in
i saw her stop suddenly as if she had been struck
he does not she said in a tone that was not her own
mr
bailey and my brother know nothing of this
the murder was committed at three
they left the house at a quarter before three  how do you know that mr jamieson asked oddly
do you know at what time they left  i do gertrude answered firmly
at a quarter before three my brother and mr bailey left the house by the main entrance
iwasthere  gertrude i said excitedly you are dreaming
why at a quarter to three  listen she said
at halfpast two the downstairs telephone rang
i had not gone to sleep and i heard it
then i heard halsey answer it and in a few minutes he came upstairs and knocked at my door
wewe talked for a minute then i put on my dressinggown and slippers and went downstairs with him
mr bailey was in the billiardroom
wewe all talked together for perhaps ten minutes
then it was decided thatthat they should both go away  cant you be more explicit mr jamieson asked
why did they go away  i am only telling you what happened not why it happened she said evenly
halsey went for the car and instead of bringing it to the house and rousing people he went by the lower road from the stable
mr bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn
mr bailey left  which way mr jamieson asked sharply
by the main entrance
he leftit was a quarter to three
i know exactly  the clock in the hall is stopped miss innes said jamieson
nothing seemed to escape him
he looked at his watch she replied and i could see mr jamiesons snap as if he had made a discovery
as for myself during the whole recital i had been plunged into the deepest amazement
will you pardon me for a personal question the detective was a youngish man and i thought he was somewhat embarrassed
what are youryour relations with mr bailey  gertrude hesitated
then she came over and put her hand lovingly in mine
i am engaged to marry him she said simply
i had grown so accustomed to surprises that i could only gasp again and as for gertrude the hand that lay in mine was burning with fever
andafter that mr jamieson went on you went directly to bed  gertrude hesitated
no she said finally
ii am not nervous and after i had extinguished the light i remembered something i had left in the billiardroom and i felt my way back there through the darkness  will you tell me what it was you had forgotten  i can not tell you she said slowly
ii did not leave the billiardroom at once  why the detectives tone was imperative
this is very important miss innes  i was crying gertrude said in a low tone
when the french clock in the drawingroom struck three i got up and theni heard a step on the east porch just outside the cardroom
some one with a key was working with the latch and i thought of course of halsey
when we took the house he called that his entrance and he had carried a key for it ever since
the door opened and i was about to ask what he had forgotten when there was a flash and a report
some heavy body dropped and half crazed with terror and shock i ran through the drawingroom and got upstairsi scarcely remember how  she dropped into a chair and i thought mr jamieson must have finished
but he was not through
you certainly clear your brother and mr bailey admirably he said
the testimony is invaluable especially in view of the fact that your brother and mr armstrong had i believe quarreled rather seriously some time ago  nonsense i broke in
things are bad enough mr jamieson without inventing bad feeling where it doesnt exist
gertrude i dont think halsey knew thethe murdered man did he  but mr jamieson was sure of his ground
the quarrel i believe he persisted was about mr armstrongs conduct to you miss gertrude
he had been paying you unwelcome attentions  and i had never seen the man
when she nodded a yes i saw the tremendous possibilities involved
if this detective could prove that gertrude feared and disliked the murdered man and that mr armstrong had been annoying and possibly pursuing her with hateful attentions all that added to gertrudes confession of her presence in the billiardroom at the time of the crime looked strange to say the least
the prominence of the family assured a strenuous effort to find the murderer and if we had nothing worse to look forward to we were sure of a distasteful publicity
mr jamieson shut his notebook with a snap and thanked us
i have an idea he said apropos of nothing at all that at any rate the ghost is laid here
whatever the rappings have beenand the colored man says they began when the family went west three months agothey are likely to stop now  which shows how much he knew about it
the ghost was not laid with the murder of arnold armstrong he or it only seemed to take on fresh vigor
mr jamieson left then and when gertrude had gone upstairs as she did at once i sat and thought over what i had just heard
her engagement once so engrossing a matter paled now beside the significance of her story
if halsey and jack bailey had left before the crime how came halseys revolver in the tulip bed
what was the mysterious cause of their sudden flight
what had gertrude left in the billiardroom
what was the significance of the cufflink and where was it
in the east corridor   when the detective left he enjoined absolute secrecy on everybody in the household
the greenwood club promised the same thing and as there are no sunday afternoon papers the murder was not publicly known until monday
the coroner himself notified the armstrong family lawyer and early in the afternoon he came out
i had not seen mr jamieson since morning but i knew he had been interrogating the servants
gertrude was locked in her room with a headache and i had luncheon alone
mr harton the lawyer was a little thin man and he looked as if he did not relish his business that day
this is very unfortunate miss innes he said after we had shaken hands
most unfortunateand mysterious
with the father and mother in the west i find everything devolves on me and as you can understand it is an unpleasant duty  no doubt i said absently
mr
harton i am going to ask you some questions and i hope you will answer them
i feel that i am entitled to some knowledge because i and my family are just now in a most ambiguous position  i dont know whether he understood me or not he took of his glasses and wiped them
i shall be very happy he said with oldfashioned courtesy
thank you
mr harton did mr arnold armstrong know that sunnyside had been rented  i thinkyes he did
in fact i myself told him about it  and he knew who the tenants were  yes  he had not been living with the family for some years i believe  no
unfortunately there had been trouble between arnold and his father
for two years he had lived in town  then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get possession of anything belonging to him  i should think it hardly possible he admitted
to be perfectly frank miss innes i can not think of any reason whatever for his coming here as he did
he had been staying at the clubhouse across the valley for the last week jarvis tells me but that only explains how he came here not why
it is a most unfortunate family  he shook his head despondently and i felt that this driedup little man was the repository of much that he had not told me
i gave up trying to elicit any information from him and we went together to view the body before it was taken to the city
it had been lifted on to the billiardtable and a sheet thrown over it otherwise nothing had been touched
a soft hat lay beside it and the collar of the dinnercoat was still turned up
the handsome dissipated face of arnold armstrong purged of its ugly lines was now only pathetic
as we went in mrs watson appeared at the cardroom door
come in mrs watson the lawyer said
but she shook her head and withdrew she was the only one in the house who seemed to regret the dead man and even she seemed rather shocked than sorry
i went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and opened it
if i could only have seen halsey coming at his usual harebrained clip up the drive if i could have heard the throb of the motor i would have felt that my troubles were over
but there was nothing to be seen
the countryside lay sunny and quiet in its peaceful sunday afternoon calm and far down the drive mr jamieson was walking slowly stooping now and then as if to examine the road
when i went back mr harton was furtively wiping his eyes
the prodigal has come home miss innes he said
how often the sins of the fathers are visited on the children which left me pondering
before mr harton left he told me something of the armstrong family
paul armstrong the father had been married twice
arnold was a son by the first marriage
the second mrs armstrong had been a widow with a child a little girl
this child now perhaps twenty was louise armstrong having taken her stepfathers name and was at present in california with the family
they will probably return at once he concluded sad part of my errand here today is to see if you will relinquish your lease here in their favor  we would better wait and see if they wish to come i said
it seems unlikely and my town house is being remodeled at that he let the matter drop but it came up unpleasantly enough later
at six oclock the body was taken away and at seventhirty after an early dinner mr harton went
gertrude had not come down and there was no news of halsey
mr jamieson had taken a lodging in the village and i had not seen him since midafternoon
it was about nine oclock i think when the bell rang and he was ushered into the livingroom
sit down i said grimly
have you found a clue that will incriminate me mr jamieson  he had the grace to look uncomfortable
no he said
if you had killed mr armstrong you would have left no clues
you would have had too much intelligence  after that we got along better
he was fishing in his pocket and after a minute he brought out two scraps of paper
i have been to the clubhouse he said and among mr armstrongs effects i found these
one is curious the other is puzzling  the first was a sheet of club notepaper on which was written over and over the name halsey b innes it was halseys flowing signature to a dot but it lacked halseys ease
the ones toward the bottom of the sheet were much better than the top ones
mr jamieson smiled at my face
his old tricks he said
that one is merely curious this one as i said before is puzzling  the second scrap folded and refolded into a compass so tiny that the writing had been partly obliterated was part of a letterthe lower half of a sheet not typed but written in a cramped hand
by altering the plans forrooms may be possible
the best way in my opinion would be tothe plan forin one of theroomschimney   that was all
well i said looking up
there is nothing in that is there
a man ought to be able to change the plan of his house without becoming an object of suspicion  there is little in the paper itself he admitted but why should arnold armstrong carry that around unless it meant something
he never built a house you may be sure of that
if it is this house it may mean anything from a secret room  to an extra bathroom i said scornfully
havent you a thumbprint too  i have he said with a smile and the print of a foot in a tulip bed and a number of other things
the oddest part is miss innes that the thumbmark is probably yours and the footprint certainly  his audacity was the only thing that saved me his amused smile put me on my mettle and i ripped out a perfectly good scallop before i answered
why did i step into the tulip bed i asked with interest
you picked up something he said goodhumoredly which you are going to tell me about later  am i indeed i was politely curious
with this remarkable insight of yours i wish you would tell me where i shall find my fourthousanddollar motor car  i was just coming to that he said
you will find it about thirty miles away at andrews station in a blacksmith shop where it is being repaired  i laid down my knitting then and looked at him
and halsey i managed to say
we are going to exchange information he said i am going to tell you that when you tell me what you picked up in the tulip bed  we looked steadily at each other it was not an unfriendly stare we were only measuring weapons
then he smiled a little and got up
with your permission he said i am going to examine the cardroom and the staircase again
you might think over my offer in the meantime  he went on through the drawingroom and i listened to his footsteps growing gradually fainter
i dropped my pretense at knitting and leaning back i thought over the last fortyeight hours
here was i rachel innes spinster a granddaughter of old john innes of revolutionary days a d a r a colonial dame mixed up with a vulgar and revolting crime and even attempting to hoodwink the law
certainly i had left the straight and narrow way
i was roused by hearing mr jamieson coming rapidly back through the drawingroom
he stopped at the door
miss innes he said quickly will you come with me and light the east corridor
i have fastened somebody in the small room at the head of the cardroom stairs  i jumped
up at once
you meanthe murderer i gasped
possibly he said quietly as we hurried together up the stairs
some one was lurking on the staircase when i went back
i spoke instead of an answer whoever it was turned and ran up
i followedit was darkbut as i turned the corner at the top a figure darted through this door and closed it
the bolt was on my side and i pushed it forward
it is a closet i think we were in the upper hall now
if you will show me the electric switch miss innes you would better wait in your own room  trembling as i was i was determined to see that door opened
i hardly knew what i feared but so many terrible and inexplicable things had happened that suspense was worse than certainty
i am perfectly cool i said and i am going to remain here  the lights flashed up along that end of the corridor throwing the doors into relief
at the intersection of the small hallway with the larger the circular staircase wound its way up as if it had been an afterthought of the architect
and just around the corner in the small corridor was the door mr jamieson had indicated
i was still unfamiliar with the house and i did not remember the door
my heart was thumping wildly in my ears but i nodded to him to go ahead
i was perhaps eight or ten feet awayand then he threw the bolt back
come out he said quietly
there was no response
comeout he repeated
theni think he had a revolver but i am not surehe stepped aside and threw the door open
from where i stood i could not see beyond the door but i saw mr jamiesons face change and heard him mutter something then he bolted down the stairs three at a time
when my knees had stopped shaking i moved forward slowly nervously until i had a partial view of what was beyond the door
it seemed at first to be a closet empty
then i went close and examined it to stop with a shudder
where the floor should have been was black void and darkness from which came the indescribable damp smell of the cellars
mr jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute
as i leaned over i fancied i heard a groanor was it the wind
a sprained ankle   i was panicstricken
as i ran along the corridor i was confident that the mysterious intruder and probable murderer had been found and that he lay dead or dying at the foot of the chute
i got down the staircase somehow and through the kitchen to the basement stairs
mr jamieson had been before me and the door stood open
liddy was standing in the middle of the kitchen holding a fryingpan by the handle as a weapon
dont go down there she yelled when she saw me moving toward the basement stairs
dont you do it miss rachel
that jamiesons down there now
theres only trouble comes of hunting ghosts they lead you into bottomless pits and things like that
oh miss rachel dont as i tried to get past her
she was interrupted by mr jamiesons reappearance
he ran up the stairs two at a time and his face was flushed and furious
the whole place is locked he said angrily
wheres the laundry key kept  its kept in the door liddy snapped
that whole end of the cellar is kept locked so nobody can get at the clothes and then the keys left in the door
so that unless a thief was as blind asas some detectives he could walk right in  liddy i said sharply come down with us and turn on all the lights  she offered her resignation as usual on the spot but i took her by the arm and she came along finally
she switched on all the lights and pointed to a door just ahead
thats the door she said sulkily
the keys in it  but the key was not in it
mr jamieson shook it but it was a heavy door well locked
and then he stooped and began punching around the keyhole with the end of a leadpencil
when he stood up his face was exultant
its locked on the inside he said in a low tone
there is somebody in there  lord have mercy gasped liddy and turned to run
liddy i called go through the house at once and see who is missing or if any one is
well have to clear this thing at once
mr jamieson if you will watch here i will go to the lodge and find warner
thomas would be of no use
together you may be able to force the door  a good idea he assented
butthere are windows of course and there is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from getting out that way  then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs i suggested and patrol the house from the outside  we agreed to this and i had a feeling that the mystery of sunnyside was about to be solved
i ran down the steps and along the drive
just at the corner i ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as much alarmed as i was
it was not until i had recoiled a step or two that i recognized gertrude and she me
good gracious aunt ray she exclaimed what is the matter  theres somebody locked in the laundry i panted
that isunlessyou didnt see any one crossing the lawn or skulking around the house did you  i think we have mystery on the brain gertrude said wearily
no i havent seen any one except old thomas who looked for all the world as if he had been ransacking the pantry
what have you locked in the laundry  i cant wait to explain i replied
i must get warner from the lodge
if you came out for air youd better put on your overshoes and then i noticed that gertrude was limpingnot much but sufficiently to make her progress very slow and seemingly painful
you have hurt yourself i said sharply
i fell over the carriage block she explained
i thought perhaps i might see halsey coming home
hehe ought to be here  i hurried on down the drive
the lodge was some distance from the house in a grove of trees where the drive met the county road
there were two white stone pillars to mark the entrance but the iron gates once closed and tended by the lodgekeeper now stood permanently open
the day of the motorcar had come no one had time for closed gates and lodgekeepers
the lodge at sunnyside was merely a sort of supplementary servants quarters it was as convenient in its appointments as the big house and infinitely more cozy
as i went down the drive my thoughts were busy
who would it be that mr jamieson had trapped in the cellar
would we find a body or some one badly injured
scarcely either
whoever had fallen had been able to lock the laundry door on the inside
if the fugitive had come from outside the house how did he get in
if it was some member of the household who could it have been
and thena feeling of horror almost overwhelmed me
gertrude
gertrude and her injured ankle
gertrude found limping slowly up the drive when i had thought she was in bed
i tried to put the thought away but it would not go
if gertrude had been on the circular staircase that night why had she fled from mr jamieson
the idea puzzling as it was seemed borne out by this circumstance
whoever had taken refuge at the head of the stairs could scarcely have been familiar with the house or with the location of the chute
the mystery seemed to deepen constantly
what possible connection could there be between halsey and gertrude and the murder of arnold armstrong
and yet every way i turned i seemed to find something that pointed to such a connection
at the foot of the drive the road described a long sloping horseshoeshaped curve around the lodge
there were lights there streaming cheerfully out on to the trees and from an upper room came wavering shadows as if some one with a lamp was moving around
i had come almost silently in my evening slippers and i had my second collision of the evening on the road just above the house
i ran full into a man in a long coat who was standing in the shadow beside the drive with his back to me watching the lighted windows
what the hell he ejaculated furiously and turned around
when he saw me however he did not wait for any retort on my part
he faded awaythis is not slang he didhe absolutely disappeared in the dusk without my getting more than a glimpse of his face
i had a vague impression of unfamiliar features and of a sort of cap with a visor
then he was gone
i went to the lodge and rapped
it required two or three poundings to bring thomas to the door and he opened it only an inch or so
where is warner i asked
ii think hes in bed mam  get him up i said and for goodness sake open the door thomas
ill wait for warner  its kind o close in here mam he said obeying gingerly and disclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior
perhaps youd keer to set on the porch an rest yoself  it was so evident that thomas did not want me inside that i went in
tell warner he is needed in a hurry i repeated and turned into the little sittingroom
i could hear thomas going up the stairs could hear him rouse warner and the steps of the chauffeur as he hurriedly dressed
but my attention was busy with the room below
on the centertable open was a sealskin traveling bag
it was filled with goldtopped bottles and brushes and it breathed opulence luxury femininity from every inch of surface
how did it get there
i was still asking myself the question when warner came running down the stairs and into the room
he was completely but somewhat incongruously dressed and his open boyish face looked abashed
he was a country boy absolutely frank and reliable of fair education and intelligenceone of the small army of american youths who turn a natural aptitude for mechanics into the special field of the automobile and earn good salaries in a congenial occupation
what is it miss innes he asked anxiously
there is some one locked in the laundry i replied
mr
jamieson wants you to help him break the lock
warner whose bag is this  he was in the doorway by this time and he pretended not to hear
warner i called come back here
whose bag is this  he stopped then but he did not turn around
itsit belongs to thomas he said and fled up the drive
to thomas
a london bag with mirrors and cosmetic jars of which thomas could not even have guessed the use
however i put the bag in the back of my mind which was fast becoming stored with anomalous and apparently irreconcilable facts and followed warner to the house
liddy had come back to the kitchen the door to the basement stairs was doublebarred and had a table pushed against it and beside her on the table was most of the kitchen paraphernalia
did you see if there was any one missing in the house i asked ignoring the array of saucepans rollingpins and the poker of the range
rosie is missing liddy said with unction
she had objected to rosie the parlor maid from the start
mrs
watson went into her room and found she had gone without her hat
people that trust themselves a dozen miles from the city in strange houses with servants they dont know neednt be surprised if they wake up some morning and find their throats cut  after which carefully veiled sarcasm liddy relapsed into gloom
warner came in then with a handful of small tools and mr jamieson went with him to the basement
oddly enough i was not alarmed
with all my heart i wished for halsey but i was not frightened
at the door he was to force warner put down his tools and looked at it
then he turned the handle
without the slightest difficulty the door opened revealing the blackness of the dryingroom beyond
mr jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust
gone he said
confound such careless work
i might have known  it was true enough
we got the lights on finally and looked all through the three rooms that constituted this wing of the basement
everything was quiet and empty
an explanation of how the fugitive had escaped injury was found in a heapedup basket of clothes under the chute
the basket had been overturned but that was all
mr jamieson examined the windows one was unlocked and offered an easy escape
the window or the door
which way had the fugitive escaped
the door seemed most probable and i hoped it had been so
i could not have borne just then to think that it was my poor gertrude we had been hounding through the darkness and yeti had met gertrude not far from that very window
i went upstairs at last tired and depressed
mrs watson and liddy were making tea in the kitchen
in certain walks of life the teapot is the refuge in times of stress trouble or sickness they give tea to the dying and they put it in the babys nursing bottle
mrs watson was fixing a tray to be sent in to me and when i asked her about rosie she confirmed her absence
shes not here she said but i would not think much of that miss innes
rosie is a pretty young girl and perhaps she has a sweetheart
it will be a good thing if she has
the maids stay much better when they have something like that to hold them here  gertrude had gone back to her room and while i was drinking my cup of hot tea mr jamieson came in
we might take up the conversation where we left off an hour and a half ago he said
but before we go on i want to say this the person who escaped from the laundry was a woman with a foot of moderate size and well arched
she wore nothing but a stocking on her right foot and in spite of the unlocked door she escaped by the window  and again i thought of gertrudes sprained ankle
was it the right or the left
the other half of the line   miss innes the detective began what is your opinion of the figure you saw on the east veranda the night you and your maid were in the house alone  it was a woman i said positively
and yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it was a man  nonsense i broke in
liddy had her eyes shutshe always shuts them when shes frightened  and you never thought then that the intruder who came later that night might be a womanthe woman in fact whom you saw on the veranda  i had reasons for thinking it was a man i said remembering the pearl cufflink
now we are getting down to business
what were your reasons for thinking that  i hesitated
if you have any reason for believing that your midnight guest was mr armstrong other than his visit here the next night you ought to tell me miss innes
we can take nothing for granted
if for instance the intruder who dropped the bar and scratched the staircaseyou see i know about thatif this visitor was a woman why should not the same woman have come back the following night met mr armstrong on the circular staircase and in alarm shot him  it was a man i reiterated
and then because i could think of no other reason for my statement i told him about the pearl cufflink
he was intensely interested
will you give me the link he said when i finished or at least let me see it
i consider it a most important clue  wont the description do  not as well as the original  well im very sorry i said as calmly as i could ithe thing is lost
itit must have fallen out of a box on my dressingtable  whatever he thought of my explanation and i knew he doubted it he made no sign
he asked me to describe the link accurately and i did so while he glanced at a list he took from his pocket
one set monogram cufflinks he read one set plain pearl links one set cufflinks womans head set with diamonds and emeralds
there is no mention of such a link as you describe and yet if your theory is right mr armstrong must have taken back in his cuffs one complete cufflink and a half perhaps of the other  the idea was new to me
if it had not been the murdered man who had entered the house that night who had it been
there are a number of strange things connected with this case the detective went on
miss gertrude innes testified that she heard some one fumbling with the lock that the door opened and that almost immediately the shot was fired
now miss innes here is the strange part of that
mr armstrong had no key with him
there was no key in the lock or on the floor
in other words the evidence points absolutely to this mr armstrong was admitted to the house from within  it is impossible i broke in
mr
jamieson do you know what your words imply
do you know that you are practically accusing gertrude innes of admitting that man  not quite that he said with his friendly smile
in fact miss innes i am quite certain she did not
but as long as i learn only parts of the truth from both you and her what can i do
i know you picked up something in the flower bed you refuse to tell me what it was
i know miss gertrude went back to the billiardroom to get something she refuses to say what
you suspect what happened to the cufflink but you wont tell me
so far all i am sure of is this i do not believe arnold armstrong was the midnight visitor who so alarmed you by droppingshall we say a golfstick
and i believe that when he did come he was admitted by some one in the house
who knowsit may have beenliddy  i stirred my tea angrily
i have always heard i said dryly that undertakers assistants are jovial young men
a mans sense of humor seems to be in inverse proportion to the gravity of his profession  a mans sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing miss innes he admitted
it is to the feminine as the hug of a bear is to the scratch ofwellanything with claws
is that you thomas
come in  thomas johnson stood in the doorway
he looked alarmed and apprehensive and suddenly i remembered the sealskin dressingbag in the lodge
thomas came just inside the door and stood with his head drooping his eyes under their shaggy gray brows fixed on mr jamieson
thomas said the detective not unkindly i sent for you to tell us what you told sam bohannon at the club the day before mr arnold was found here dead
let me see
you came here friday night to see miss innes didnt you
and came to work here saturday morning  for some unexplained reason thomas looked relieved
yas sah he said
you see it were like this when mistah armstrong and the famly went away mis watson an me we was lef in charge till the place was rented
mis watson sheve bin here a good while an she warn skeery
so she slep in the house
id bin havin tokensi tol mis innes some of eman i slep in the lodge
then one day mis watson she came to me an she sez sez she thomas youll hev to sleep up in the big house
im too nervous to do it any more but i jes reckon to myself that ef its too skeery fer her its too skeery fer me
we had it then sho nuff and it ended up with mis watson stayin in the lodge nights an me lookin fer work at de club  did mrs watson say that anything had happened to alarm her  no sah
she was jes natchally skeered
well that was all fars i know until the night i come over to see mis innes
i come across the valley along the path from the clubhouse and i goes home that way
down in the creek bottom i almost run into a man
he wuz standin with his back to me an he was workin with one of these yere electric light things that fit in yer pocket
he was havin troubleone minute itd flash out an the nex itd be gone
i hed a view of is white dress shirt an tie as i passed
i didnt see his face
but i know it warnt mr arnold
it was a taller man than mr arnold
beside that mr arnold was playin cards when i got to the clubhouse sames hed been doin all day  and the next morning you came back along the path pursued mr jamieson relentlessly
the nex mornin i come back along the path an down where i dun see the man night befoh i picked up this here the old man held out a tiny object and mr jamieson took it
then he held it on his extended palm for me to see
it was the other half of the pearl cufflink
but mr jamieson was not quite through questioning him
and so you showed it to sam at the club and asked him if he knew any one who owned such a link and sam saidwhat  wal sam he lowed hed seen such a pair of cuffbuttons in a shirt belongin to mr baileymr
jack bailey sah  ill keep this link thomas for a while the detective said
thats all i wanted to know
good night  as thomas shuffled out mr jamieson watched me sharply
you see miss innes he said mr
bailey insists on mixing himself with this thing
if mr bailey came here that friday night expecting to meet arnold armstrong and missed himif as i say he had done this might he not seeing him enter the following night have struck him down as he had intended before  but the motive i gasped
there could be motive proved i think
arnold armstrong and john bailey have been enemies since the latter as cashier of the traders bank brought arnold almost into the clutches of the law
also you forget that both men have been paying attention to miss gertrude
baileys flight looks bad too  and you think halsey helped him to escape  undoubtedly
why what could it be but flight
miss innes let me reconstruct that evening as i see it
bailey and armstrong had quarreled at the club
i learned this today
your nephew brought bailey over
prompted by jealous insane fury armstrong followed coming across by the path
he entered the billiardroom wingperhaps rapping and being admitted by your nephew
just inside he was shot by some one on the circular staircase
the shot fired your nephew and bailey left the house at once going toward the automobile house
they left by the lower road which prevented them being heard and when you and miss gertrude got downstairs everything was quiet  butgertrudes story i stammered
miss gertrude only brought forward her explanation the following morning
i do not believe it miss innes
it is the story of a loving and ingenious woman  andthis thing tonight  may upset my whole view of the case
we must give the benefit of every doubt after all
we may for instance come back to the figure on the porch if it was a woman you saw that night through the window we might start with other premises
or mr innes explanation may turn us in a new direction
it is possible that he shot arnold armstrong as a burglar and then fled frightened at what he had done
in any case however i feel confident that the body was here when he left
mr armstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter about half after eleven oclock
it was three when the shot was fired  i leaned back bewildered
it seemed to me that the evening had been full of significant happenings had i only held the key
had gertrude been the fugitive in the clothes chute
who was the man on the drive near the lodge and whose goldmounted dressingbag had i seen in the lodge sittingroom
it was late when mr jamieson finally got up to go
i went with him to the door and together we stood looking out over the valley
below lay the village of casanova with its old world houses its blossoming trees and its peace
above on the hill across the valley were the lights of the greenwood club
it was even possible to see the curving row of parallel lights that marked the carriage road
rumors that i had heard about the club came backof drinking of high play and once a year ago of a suicide under those very lights
mr jamieson left taking a short cut to the village and i still stood there
it must have been after eleven and the monotonous tick of the big clock on the stairs behind me was the only sound
then i was conscious that some one was running up the drive
in a minute a woman darted into the area of light made by the open door and caught me by the arm
it was rosierosie in a state of collapse from terror and not the least important clutching one of my coalport plates and a silver spoon
she stood staring into the darkness behind still holding the plate
i got her into the house and secured the plate then i stood and looked down at her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway
well i asked didnt your young man enjoy his meal  she couldnt speak
she looked at the spoon she still heldi wasnt so anxious about it thank heaven it wouldnt chipand then she stared at me
i appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him i went on but the next time you might take the limoges china its more easily duplicated and less expensive  i havent a young mannot here she had got her breath now as i had guessed she would
ii have been chased by a thief miss innes  did he chase you out of the house and back again i asked
then rosie began to crynot silently but noisily hysterically
i stopped her by giving her a good shake
what in the world is the matter with you i snapped
has the day of good common sense gone by
sit up and tell me the whole thing rosie sat up then and sniffled
i was coming up the drive she began
you must start with when you went down the drive with my dishes and my silver i interrupted but seeing more signs of hysteria i gave in
very well
you were coming up the drive  i had a basket ofof silver and dishes on my arm and i was carrying the plate becausebecause i was afraid id break it
partway up the road a man stepped out of the bushes and held his arm like this spread out so i couldnt get past
he saidhe saidnot so fast young lady i want you to let me see whats in that basket  she got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm
it was like this miss innes she said and say you was the man
when he said that i screamed and ducked under his arm like this
he caught at the basket and i dropped it
i ran as fast as i could and he came after as far as the trees
then he stopped
oh miss innes it must have been the man that killed that mr armstrong  dont be foolish i said
whoever killed mr armstrong would put as much space between himself and this house as he could
go up to bed now and mind if i hear of this story being repeated to the other maids i shall deduct from your wages for every broken dish i find in the drive  i listened to rosie as she went upstairs running past the shadowy places and slamming her door
then i sat down and looked at the coalport plate and the silver spoon
i had brought my own china and silver and from all appearances i would have little enough to take back
but though i might jeer at rosie as much as i wished the fact remained that some one had been on the drive that night who had no business there
although neither had rosie for that matter
i could fancy liddys face when she missed the extra pieces of chinashe had opposed rosie from the start
if liddy once finds a prophecy fulfilled especially an unpleasant one she never allows me to forget it
it seemed to me that it was absurd to leave that china dotted along the road for her to spy the next morning so with a sudden resolution i opened the door again and stepped out into the darkness
as the door closed behind me i half regretted my impulse then i shut my teeth and went on
i have never been a nervous woman as i said before
moreover a minute or two in the darkness enabled me to see things fairly well
beulah gave me rather a start by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet then we two side by side went down the drive
there were no fragments of china but where the grove began i picked up a silver spoon
so far rosies story was borne out i began to wonder if it were not indiscreet to say the least this midnight prowling in a neighborhood with such a deservedly bad reputation
then i saw something gleaming which proved to be the handle of a cup and a step or two farther on i found a vshaped bit of a plate
but the most surprising thing of all was to find the basket sitting comfortably beside the road with the rest of the broken crockery piled neatly within and a handful of small silver spoon forks and the like on top
i could only stand and stare
then rosies story was true
but where had rosie carried her basket
and why had the thief if he were a thief picked up the broken china out of the road and left it with his booty
it was with my nearest approach to a nervous collapse that i heard the familiar throbbing of an automobile engine
as it came closer i recognized the outline of the dragon fly and knew that halsey had come back
strange enough it must have seemed to halsey too to come across me in the middle of the night with the skirt of my gray silk gown over my shoulders to keep off the dew holding a red and green basket under one arm and a black cat under the other
what with relief and joy i began to cry right there and very nearly wiped my eyes on beulah in the excitement
just like a girl   aunt ray halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps
what in the world are you doing here  taking a walk i said trying to be composed
i dont think the answer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time
oh halsey where have you been  let me take you up to the house he was in the road and had beulah and the basket out of my arms in a moment
i could see the car plainly now and warner was at the wheelwarner in an ulster and a pair of slippers over heaven knows what
jack bailey was not there
i got in and we went slowly and painfully up to the house
we did not talk
what we had to say was too important to commence there and besides it took all kinds of coaxing from both men to get the dragon fly up the last grade
only when we had closed the front door and stood facing each other in the hall did halsey say anything
he slipped his strong young arm around my shoulders and turned me so i faced the light
poor aunt ray he said gently
and i nearly wept again
ii must see gertrude too we will have a threecornered talk  and then gertrude herself came down the stairs
she had not been to bed evidently she still wore the white neglige she had worn earlier in the evening and she limped somewhat
during her slow progress down the stairs i had time to notice one thing mr jamieson had said the woman who escaped from the cellar had worn no shoe on her right foot
gertrudes right ankle was the one she had sprained
the meeting between brother and sister was tense but without tears
halsey kissed her tenderly and i noticed evidences of strain and anxiety in both young faces
is everythingright she asked
right as can be with forced cheerfulness
i lighted the livingroom and we went in there
only a halfhour before i had sat with mr jamieson in that very room listening while he overtly accused both gertrude and halsey of at least a knowledge of the death of arnold armstrong
now halsey was here to speak for himself i should learn everything that had puzzled me
i saw it in the paper tonight for the first time he was saying
it knocked me dumb
when i think of this houseful of women and a thing like that occurring  gertrudes face was still set and white
that isnt all halsey she said
you andand jack left almost at the time it happened
the detective here thinks that youthat weknow something about it  the devil he does halseys eyes were fairly starting from his head
i beg your pardon aunt ray butthe fellows a lunatic  tell me everything wont you halsey i begged
tell me where you went that night or rather morning and why you went as you did
this has been a terrible fortyeight hours for all of us  he stood staring at me and i could see the horror of the situation dawning in his face
i cant tell you where i went aunt ray he said after a moment
as to why you will learn that soon enough
but gertrude knows that jack and i left the house before this thingthis horrible murderoccurred  mr
jamieson does not believe me gertrude said drearily
halsey if the worst comes if they should arrest you you musttell  i shall tell nothing he said with a new sternness in his voice
aunt ray it was necessary for jack and me to leave that night
i can not tell you whyjust yet
as to where we went if i have to depend on that as an alibi i shall not tell
the whole thing is an absurdity a trumpedup charge that can not possibly be serious  has mr bailey gone back to the city i demanded or to the club  neither defiantly at the present moment i do not know where he is  halsey i asked gravely leaning forward have you the slightest suspicion who killed arnold armstrong
the police think he was admitted from within and that he was shot down from above by someone on the circular staircase  i know nothing of it he maintained but i fancied i caught a sudden glance at gertrude a flash of something that died as it came
as quietly as calmly as i could i went over the whole story from the night liddy and i had been alone up to the strange experience of rosie and her pursuer
the basket still stood on the table a mute witness to this last mystifying occurrence
there is something else i said hesitatingly at the last
halsey i have never told this even to gertrude but the morning after the crime i found in a tulip bed a revolver
itit was yours halsey  for an appreciable moment halsey stared at me
then he turned to gertrude
my revolver trude he exclaimed
why jack took my revolver with him didnt he  oh for heavens sake dont say that i implored
the detective thinks possibly jack bailey came back andand the thing happened then  he didnt come back halsey said sternly
gertrude when you brought down a revolver that night for jack to take with him what one did you bring
mine  gertrude was defiant now
no
yours was loaded and i was afraid of what jack might do
i gave him one i have had for a year or two
it was empty  halsey threw up both hands despairingly
if that isnt like a girl he said
why didnt you do what i asked you to gertrude
you send bailey off with an empty gun and throw mine in a tulip bed of all places on earth
mine was a thirtyeight caliber
the inquest will show of course that the bullet that killed armstrong was a thirtyeight
then where shall i be  you forget i broke in that i have the revolver and that no one knows about it  but gertrude had risen angrily
i can not stand it it is always with me she cried
halsey i did not throw your revolver into the tulip bed
ithinkyoudid ityourself  they stared at each other across the big library table with young eyes all at once hard suspicious
and then gertrude held out both hands to him appealingly
we must not she said brokenly
just now with so much at stake itis shameful
i know you are as ignorant as i am
make me believe it halsey  halsey soothed her as best he could and the breach seemed healed
but long after i went to bed he sat downstairs in the livingroom alone and i knew he was going over the case as he had learned it
some things were clear to him that were dark to me
he knew and gertrude too why jack bailey and he had gone away that night as they did
he knew where they had been for the last fortyeight hours and why jack bailey had not returned with him
it seemed to me that without fuller confidence from both the childrenthey are always children to mei should never be able to learn anything
as i was finally getting ready for bed halsey came upstairs and knocked at my door
when i had got into a negligei used to say wrapper before gertrude came back from schooli let him in
he stood in the doorway a moment and then he went into agonies of silent mirth
i sat down on the side of the bed and waited in severe silence for him to stop but he only seemed to grow worse
when he had recovered he took me by the elbow and pulled me in front of the mirror
how to be beautiful he quoted
advice to maids and matrons by beatrice fairfax and then i saw myself
i had neglected to remove my wrinkle eradicators and i presume my appearance was odd
i believe that it is a womans duty to care for her looks but it is much like telling a necessary falsehoodone must not be found out
by the time i got them off halsey was serious again and i listened to his story
aunt ray he began extinguishing his cigarette on the back of my ivory hairbrush i would give a lot to tell you the whole thing
buti cant for a day or so anyhow
but one thing i might have told you a long time ago
if you had known it you would not have suspected me for a moment ofof having anything to do with the attack on arnold armstrong
goodness knows what i might do to a fellow like that if there was enough provocation and i had a gun in my handunder ordinary circumstances
buti care a great deal about louise armstrong aunt ray
i hope to marry her some day
is it likely i would kill her brother  her stepbrother i corrected
no of course it isnt likely or possible
why didnt you tell me halsey  well there were two reasons he said slowly
one was that you had a girl already picked out for me  nonsense i broke in and felt myself growing red
i had indeed one of thebut no matter
and the second reason he pursued was that the armstrongs would have none of me  i sat bolt upright at that and gasped
the armstrongs i repeated
with old peter armstrong driving a stage across the mountains while your grandfather was war governor  well of course the war governors dead and out of the matrimonial market halsey interrupted
and the present innes admits himself he isnt good enough forfor louise  exactly i said despairingly and of course you are taken at your own valuation
the inneses are not always so selfdepreciatory  not always no he said looking at me with his boyish smile
fortunately louise doesnt agree with her family
shes willing to take me war governor or no provided her mother consents
she isnt overlyfond of her stepfather but she adores her mother
and now cant you see where this thing puts me
down and out with all of them  but the whole thing is absurd i argued
and besides gertrudes sworn statement that you left before arnold armstrong came would clear you at once  halsey got up and began to pace the room and the air of cheerfulness dropped like a mask
she cant swear it he said finally
gertrudes story was true as far as it went but she didnt tell everything
arnold armstrong came here at twothirtycame into the billiardroom and left in five minutes
he came to bringsomething  halsey i cried you must tell me the whole truth
every time i see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of mystery
what did he bring  a telegramfor bailey he said
it came by special messenger from town and wasmost important
bailey had started for here and the messenger had gone back to the city
the steward gave it to arnold who had been drinking all day and couldnt sleep and was going for a stroll in the direction of sunnyside  and he brought it  yes  what was in the telegram  i can tell youas soon as certain things are made public
it is only a matter of days now gloomily
and gertrudes story of a telephone message  poor trude he half whispered
poor loyal little girl
aunt ray there was no such message
no doubt your detective already knows that and discredits all gertrude told him  and when she went back it was to getthe telegram  probably halsey said slowly
when you get to thinking about it aunt ray it looks bad for all three of us doesnt it
and yeti will take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed that poor devil  i looked at the closed door into gertrudes dressingroom and lowered my voice
the same horrible thought keeps recurring to me i whispered
halsey gertrude probably had your revolver she must have examined it anyhow that night
after youand jack had gone what if that ruffian came back and sheand she  i couldnt finish
halsey stood looking at me with shut lips
she might have heard him fumbling at the door he had no key the police sayand thinking it was you or jack she admitted him
when she saw her mistake she ran up the stairs a step or two and turning like an animal at bay she fired  halsey had his hand over my lips before i finished and in that position we stared each at the other our stricken glances crossing
the revolvermy revolverthrown into the tulip bed he muttered to himself
thrown perhaps from an upper window you say it was buried deep
her prostration ever since heraunt ray you dont think it was gertrude who fell down the clothes chute  i could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative
the traders bank   the morning after halseys return was tuesday
arnold armstrong had been found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at three oclock on sunday morning
the funeral services were to be held on tuesday and the interment of the body was to be deferred until the armstrongs arrived from california
no one i think was very sorry that arnold armstrong was dead but the manner of his death aroused some sympathy and an enormous amount of curiosity
mrs ogden fitzhugh a cousin took charge of the arrangements and everything i believe was as quiet as possible
i gave thomas johnson and mrs watson permission to go into town to pay their last respects to the dead man but for some reason they did not care to go
halsey spent part of the day with mr jamieson but he said nothing of what happened
he looked grave and anxious and he had a long conversation with gertrude late in the afternoon
tuesday evening found us quiet with the quiet that precedes an explosion
gertrude and halsey were both gloomy and distraught and as liddy had already discovered that some of the china was brokenit is impossible to have any secrets from an old servanti was not in a pleasant humor myself
warner brought up the afternoon mail and the evening papers at seveni was curious to know what the papers said of the murder
we had turned away at least a dozen reporters
but i read over the headline that ran halfway across the top of the gazette twice before i comprehended it
halsey had opened the chronicle and was staring at it fixedly
the traders bank closes its doors was what i read and then i put down the paper and looked across the table
did you know of this i asked halsey
i expected it
but not so soon he replied
and you to gertrude
jacktold ussomething gertrude said faintly
oh halsey what can he do now  jack i said scornfully
your jacks flight is easy enough to explain now
and you helped him both of you to get away
you get that from your mother it isnt an innes trait
do you know that every dollar you have both of you is in that bank  gertrude tried to speak but halsey stopped her
that isnt all gertrude he said quietly jack isunder arrest  under arrest gertrude screamed and tore the paper out of his hand
she glanced at the heading then she crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it to the floor
while halsey looking stricken and white was trying to smooth it out and read it gertrude had dropped her head on the table and was sobbing stormily
i have the clipping somewhere but just now i can remember only the essentials
on the afternoon before monday while the traders bank was in the rush of closing hour between two and three mr jacob trautman president of the pearl brewing company came into the bank to lift a loan
as security for the loan he had deposited some three hundred international steamship company s in total value three hundred thousand dollars
mr trautman went to the loan clerk and after certain formalities had been gone through the loan clerk went to the vault
mr trautman who was a large and genial german waited for a time whistling under his breath
the loan clerk did not come back
after an interval mr trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the vault and go to the assistant cashier the two went hurriedly to the vault
a lapse of another ten minutes and the assistant cashier came out and approached mr trautman
he was noticeably white and trembling
mr trautman was told that through an oversight the bonds had been misplaced and was asked to return the following morning when everything would be made all right
mr trautman however was a shrewd business man and he did not like the appearance of things
he left the bank apparently satisfied and within thirty minutes he had called up three different members of the traders board of directors
at threethirty there was a hastily convened board meeting with some stormy scenes and late in the afternoon a national bank examiner was in possession of the books
the bank had not opened for business on tuesday
at twelvethirty oclock the saturday before as soon as the business of the day was closed mr john bailey the cashier of the defunct bank had taken his hat and departed
during the afternoon he had called up mr aronson a member of the board and said he was ill and might not be at the bank for a day or two
as bailey was highly thought of mr aronson merely expressed a regret
from that time until monday night when mr bailey had surrendered to the police little was known of his movements
some time after one on saturday he had entered the western union office at cherry and white streets and had sent two telegrams
he was at the greenwood country club on saturday night and appeared unlike himself
it was reported that he would be released under enormous bond some time that day tuesday
the article closed by saying that while the officers of the bank refused to talk until the examiner had finished his work it was known that securities aggregating a million and a quarter were missing
then there was a diatribe on the possibility of such an occurrence on the folly of a oneman bank and of a board of directors that met only to lunch together and to listen to a brief report from the cashier and on the poor policy of a government that arranges a three or fourday examination twice a year
the mystery it insinuated had not been cleared by the arrest of the cashier
before now minor officials had been used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up
inseparable as the words speculation and peculation have grown to be john bailey was not known to be in the stock market
his only words after his surrender had been send for mr armstrong at once the telegraph message which had finally reached the president of the traders bank in an interior town in california had been responded to by a telegram from doctor walker the young physician who was traveling with the armstrong family saying that paul armstrong was very ill and unable to travel
that was how things stood that tuesday evening
the traders bank had suspended payment and john bailey was under arrest charged with wrecking it paul armstrong lay very ill in california and his only son had been murdered two days before
i sat dazed and bewildered
the childrens money was gone that was bad enough though i had plenty if they would let me share
but gertrudes grief was beyond any power of mine to comfort the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal embezzlementand even worse
for in the instant that i sat there i seemed to see the coils closing around john bailey as the murderer of arnold armstrong
gertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table at halsey
why did he do it she wailed
couldnt you stop him halsey
it was suicidal to go back  halsey was looking steadily through the windows of the breakfastroom but it was evident he saw nothing
it was the only thing he could do trude he said at last
aunt ray when i found jack at the greenwood club last saturday night he was frantic
i can not talk until jack tells me i may buthe is absolutely innocent of all this believe me
i thought trude and i thought we were helping him but it was the wrong way
he came back
isnt that the act of an innocent man  then why did he leave at all i asked unconvinced
what innocent man would run away from here at three oclock in the morning
doesnt it look rather as though he thought it impossible to escape  gertrude rose angrily
you are not even just she flamed
you dont know anything about it and you condemn him  i know that we have all lost a great deal of money i said
i shall believe mr bailey innocent the moment he is shown to be
you profess to know the truth but you can not tell me
what am i to think  halsey leaned over and patted my hand
you must take us on faith he said
jack bailey hasnt a penny that doesnt belong to him the guilty man will be known in a day or so  i shall believe that when it is proved i said grimly
in the meantime i take no one on faith
the inneses never do  gertrude who had been standing aloof at a window turned suddenly
but when the bonds are offered for sale halsey wont the thief be detected at once  halsey turned with a superior smile
it wouldnt be done that way he said
they would be taken out of the vault by some one who had access to it and used as collateral for a loan in another bank
it would be possible to realize eighty per cent
of their face value  in cash  in cash  but the man who did ithe would be known  yes
i tell you both as sure as i stand here i believe that paul armstrong looted his own bank
i believe he has a million at least as the result and that he will never come back
im worse than a pauper now
i cant ask louise to share nothing a year with me and when i think of this disgrace for her im crazy  the most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with possibilities that day and when halsey was called to the telephone i ceased all pretense at eating
when he came back from the telephone his face showed that something had occurred
he waited however until thomas left the diningroom then he told us
paul armstrong is dead he announced gravely
he died this morning in california
whatever he did he is beyond the law now  gertrude turned pale
and the only man who could have cleared jack can never do it she said despairingly
also i replied coldly mr
armstrong is for ever beyond the power of defending himself
when your jack comes to me with some two hundred thousand dollars in his hands which is about what you have lost i shall believe him innocent  halsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me
there you go he exclaimed
if he was the thief he could return the money of course
if he is innocent he probably hasnt a tenth of that amount in the world
in his hands
thats like a woman  gertrude who had been pale and despairing during the early part of the conversation had flushed an indignant red
she got up and drew herself to her slender height looking down at me with the scorn of the young and positive
you are the only mother i ever had she said tensely
i have given you all i would have given my mother had she livedmy love my trust
and now when i need you most you fail me
i tell you john bailey is a good man an honest man
if you say he is not youyou  gertrude halsey broke in sharply
she dropped beside the table and burying her face in her arms broke into a storm of tears
i love himlove him she sobbed in a surrender that was totally unlike her
oh i never thought it would be like this
i cant bear it
i cant  halsey and i stood helpless before the storm
i would have tried to comfort her but she had put me away and there was something aloof in her grief something new and strange
at last when her sorrow had subsided to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child without raising her head she put out one groping hand
aunt ray she whispered
in a moment i was on my knees beside her her arm around my neck her cheek against my hair
where am i in this halsey said suddenly and tried to put his arms around us both
it was a welcome distraction and gertrude was soon herself again
the little storm had cleared the air
nevertheless my opinion remained unchanged
there was much to be cleared up before i would consent to any renewal of my acquaintance with john bailey
and halsey and gertrude knew it knowing me
halsey makes a capture   it was about halfpast eight when we left the diningroom and still engrossed with one subject the failure of the bank and its attendant evils halsey and i went out into the grounds for a stroll
gertrude followed us shortly
the light was thickening to appropriate shakespeares description of twilight and once again the treetoads and the crickets were making night throb with their tiny life
it was almost oppressively lonely in spite of its beauty and i felt a sickening pang of homesickness for my city at nightfor the clatter of horses feet on cemented paving for the lights the voices the sound of children playing
the country after dark oppresses me
the stars quite eclipsed in the city by the electric lights here become insistent assertive
whether i want to or not i find myself looking for the few i know by name and feeling ridiculously new and small by contrastalways an unpleasant sensation
after gertrude joined us we avoided any further mention of the murder
to halsey as to me there was ever present i am sure the thought of our conversation of the night before
as we strolled back and forth along the drive mr jamieson emerged from the shadow of the trees
good evening he said managing to include gertrude in his bow
gertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him and she nodded coldly
halsey however was more cordial although we were all constrained enough
he and gertrude went on together leaving the detective to walk with me
as soon as they were out of earshot he turned to me
do you know miss innes he said the deeper i go into this thing the more strange it seems to me
i am very sorry for miss gertrude
it looks as if bailey whom she has tried so hard to save is worse than a rascal and after her plucky fight for him it seems hard  i looked through the dusk to where gertrudes light dinner dress gleamed among the trees
she had made a plucky fight poor child
whatever she might have been driven to do i could find nothing but a deep sympathy for her
if she had only come to me with the whole truth then
miss innes mr jamieson was saying in the last three days have you seen aany suspicious figures around the grounds
anywoman  no i replied
i have a houseful of maids that will bear watching one and all
but there has been no strange woman near the house or liddy would have seen her you may be sure
she has a telescopic eye  mr jamieson looked thoughtful
it may not amount to anything he said slowly
it is difficult to get any perspective on things around here because every one down in the village is sure he saw the murderer either before or since the crime
and half of them will stretch a point or two as to facts to be obliging
but the man who drives the hack down there tells a story that may possibly prove to be important  i have heard it i think
was it the one the parlor maid brought up yesterday about a ghost wringing its hands on the roof
or perhaps its the one the milkboy heard a tramp washing a dirty shirt presumably bloody in the creek below the bridge  i could see the gleam of mr jamiesons teeth as he smiled
neither he said
but matthew geist which is our friends name claims that on saturday night at ninethirty a veiled lady  i knew it would be a veiled lady i broke in
a veiled lady he persisted who was apparently young and beautiful engaged his hack and asked to be driven to sunnyside
near the gate however she made him stop in spite of his remonstrances saying she preferred to walk to the house
she paid him and he left her there
now miss innes you had no such visitor i believe  none i said decidedly
geist thought it might be a maid as you had got a supply that day
but he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him
anyhow we have now one veiled lady who with the ghostly intruder of friday night makes two assets that i hardly know what to do with  it is mystifying i admitted although i can think of one possible explanation
the path from the greenwood club to the village enters the road near the lodge gate
a woman who wished to reach the country club unperceived might choose such a method
there are plenty of women there  i think this gave him something to ponder for in a short time he said good night and left
but i myself was far from satisfied
i was determined however on one thing
if my suspicionsfor i had suspicionswere true i would make my own investigations and mr jamieson should learn only what was good for him to know
we went back to the house and gertrude who was more like herself since her talk with halsey sat down at the mahogany desk in the livingroom to write a letter
halsey prowled up and down the entire east wing now in the cardroom now in the billiardroom and now and then blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among the pink and gold hangings of the drawingroom
after a little i joined him in the billiardroom and together we went over the details of the discovery of the body
the cardroom was quite dark
where we sat in the billiardroom only one of the side brackets was lighted and we spoke in subdued tones as the hour and the subject seemed to demand
when i spoke of the figure liddy and i had seen on the porch through the cardroom window friday night halsey sauntered into the darkened room and together we stood there much as liddy and i had done that other night
the window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before
a few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body of arnold armstrong had been found
i was a bit nervous and i put my hand on halseys sleeve
suddenly from the top of the staircase above us came the sound of a cautious footstep
at first i was not sure but halseys attitude told me he had heard and was listening
the step slow measured infinitely cautious was nearer now
halsey tried to loosen my fingers but i was in a paralysis of fright
the swish of a body against the curving rail as if for guidance was plain enough and now whoever it was had reached the foot of the staircase and had caught a glimpse of our rigid silhouettes against the billiardroom doorway
halsey threw me off then and strode forward
who is it he called imperiously and took a half dozen rapid strides toward the foot of the staircase
then i heard him mutter something there was the crash of a falling body the slam of the outer door and for an instant quiet
i screamed i think
then i remember turning on the lights and finding halsey white with fury trying to untangle himself from something warm and fleecy
he had cut his forehead a little on the lowest step of the stairs and he was rather a ghastly sight
he flung the white object at me and jerking open the outer door raced into the darkness
gertrude had come on hearing the noise and now we stood staring at each other overof all things on eartha white silk and wool blanket exquisitely fine
it was the most unghostly thing in the world with its lavender border and its faint scent
gertrude was the first to speak
somebodyhad it she asked
yes
halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell
gertrude that blanket is not mine
i have never seen before  she held it up and looked at it then she went to the door on to the veranda and threw it open
perhaps a hundred feet from the house were two figures that moved slowly toward us as we looked
when they came within range of the light i recognized halsey and with him mrs watson the housekeeper
one mystery for another   the most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the attendant circumstances are unusual
there was no reason on earth why mrs watson should not have carried a blanket down the east wing staircase if she so desired
but to take a blanket down at eleven oclock at night with every precaution as to noise and when discovered to fling it at halsey and bolthalseys word and a good oneinto the groundsthis made the incident more than significant
they moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps
halsey was talking quietly and mrs watson was looking down and listening
she was a woman of a certain amount of dignity most efficient so far as i could see although liddy would have found fault if she dared
but just now mrs watsons face was an enigma
she was defiant i think under her mask of submission and she still showed the effect of nervous shock
mrs
watson i said severely will you be so good as to explain this rather unusual occurrence  i dont think it so unusual miss innes her voice was deep and very clear just now it was somewhat tremulous
i was taking a blanket down to thomas who isnot well tonight and i used this staircase as being nearer the path to the lodge
whenmr
innes called and then rushed at me ii was alarmed and flung the blanket at him  halsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small mirror on the wall
it was not much of an injury but it had bled freely and his appearance was rather terrifying
thomas ill he said over his shoulder
why i thought i saw thomas out there as you made that cyclonic break out of the door and over the porch  i could see that under pretense of examining his injury he was watching her through the mirror
is this one of the servants blankets mrs watson i asked holding up its luxurious folds to the light
everything else is locked away she replied
which was true enough no doubt
i had rented the house without bed furnishings
if thomas is ill halsey said some member of the family ought to go down to see him
you neednt bother mrs watson
i will take the blanket  she drew herself up quickly as if in protest but she found nothing to say
she stood smoothing the folds of her dead black dress her face as white as chalk above it
then she seemed to make up her mind
very well mr innes she said
perhaps you would better go
i have done all i could  and then she turned and went up the circular staircase moving slowly and with a certain dignity
below the three of us stared at one another across the intervening white blanket
upon my word halsey broke out this place is a walking nightmare
i have the feeling that we three outsiders who have paid our money for the privilege of staying in this spookfactory are living on the very top of things
were on the lid so to speak
now and then we get a sight of the things inside but we are not a part of them  do you suppose gertrude asked doubtfully that she really meant that blanket for thomas  thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree halsey replied when i ran after mrs watson
its down to this aunt ray
rosies basket and mrs watsons blanket can only mean one thing there is somebody hiding or being hidden in the lodge
it wouldnt surprise me if we hold the key to the whole situation now
anyhow im going to the lodge to investigate  gertrude wanted to go too but she looked so shaken that i insisted she should not
i sent for liddy to help her to bed and then halsey and i started for the lodge
the grass was heavy with dew and manlike halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn
halfway however he stopped
wed better go by the drive he said
this isnt a lawn its a field
wheres the gardener these days  there isnt any i said meekly
we have been thankful enough so far to have our meals prepared and served and the beds aired
the gardener who belongs here is working at the club  remind me tomorrow to send out a man from town he said
i know the very fellow  i record this scrap of conversation just as i have tried to put down anything and everything that had a bearing on what followed because the gardener halsey sent the next day played an important part in the events of the next few weeksevents that culminated as you know by stirring the country profoundly
at that time however i was busy trying to keep my skirts dry and paid little or no attention to what seemed then a most trivial remark
along the drive i showed halsey where i had found rosies basket with the bits of broken china piled inside
he was rather skeptical
warner probably he said when i had finished
began it as a joke on rosie and ended by picking up the broken china out of the road knowing it would play hob with the tires of the car which shows how near one can come to the truth and yet miss it altogether
at the lodge everything was quiet
there was a light in the sittingroom downstairs and a faint gleam as if from a shaded lamp in one of the upper rooms
halsey stopped and examined the lodge with calculating eyes
i dont know aunt ray he said dubiously this is hardly a womans affair
if theres a scrap of any kind you hike for the timber which was halseys solicitous care for me put into vernacular
i shall stay right here i said and crossing the small veranda now shaded and fragrant with honeysuckle i hammered the knocker on the door
thomas opened the door himselfthomas fully dressed and in his customary health
i had the blanket over my arm
i brought the blanket thomas i said i am sorry you are so ill  the old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket
his confusion under other circumstances would have been ludicrous
what
not ill halsey said from the step
thomas im afraid youve been malingering  thomas seemed to have been debating something with himself
now he stepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind him
i reckon you bettah come in mis innes he said speaking cautiously
its got so i dunno what to do and its boun to come out some time er ruther  he threw the door open then and i stepped inside halsey close behind
in the sittingroom the old negro turned with quiet dignity to halsey
you bettah sit down sah he said
its a place for a woman sah  things were not turning out the way halsey expected
he sat down on the centertable with his hands thrust in his pockets and watched me as i followed thomas up the narrow stairs
at the top a woman was standing and a second glance showed me it was rosie
she shrank back a little but i said nothing
and then thomas motioned to a partly open door and i went in
the lodge boasted three bedrooms upstairs all comfortably furnished
in this one the largest and airiest a night lamp was burning and by its light i could make out a plain white metal bed
a girl was asleep thereor in a half stupor for she muttered something now and then
rosie had taken her courage in her hands and coming in had turned up the light
it was only then that i knew
feverflushed ill as she was i recognized louise armstrong
i stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement
louise here hiding at the lodge ill and alone
rosie came up to the bed and smoothed the white counterpane
i am afraid she is worse tonight she ventured at last
i put my hand on the sick girls forehead
it was burning with fever and i turned to where thomas lingered in the hallway
will you tell me what you mean thomas johnson by not telling me this before i demanded indignantly
thomas quailed
mis louise wouldn let me he said earnestly
i wanted to
she ought to a had a doctor the night she came but she wouldn hear to it
is sheis she very bad mis innes  bad enough i said coldly
send mr innes up  halsey came up the stairs slowly looking rather interested and inclined to be amused
for a moment he could not see anything distinctly in the darkened room he stopped glanced at rosie and at me and then his eyes fell on the restless head on the pillow
i think he felt who it was before he really saw her he crossed the room in a couple of strides and bent over the bed
louise he said softly but she did not reply and her eyes showed no recognition
halsey was young and illness was new to him
he straightened himself slowly still watching her and caught my arm
shes dying aunt ray he said huskily
dying
why she doesnt know me  fudge i snapped being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are aroused
shes doing nothing of the sortand dont pinch my arm
if you want something to do go and choke thomas  but at that moment louise roused from her stupor to cough and at the end of the paroxysm as rosie laid her back exhausted she knew us
that was all halsey wanted to him consciousness was recovery
he dropped on his knees beside the bed and tried to tell her she was all right and we would bring her around in a hurry and how beautiful she lookedonly to break down utterly and have to stop
and at that i came to my senses and put him out
this instant i ordered as he hesitated
and send rosie here  he did not go far
he sat on the top step of the stairs only leaving to telephone for a doctor and getting in everybodys way in his eagerness to fetch and carry
i got him away finally by sending him to fix up the car as a sort of ambulance in case the doctor would allow the sick girl to be moved
he sent gertrude down to the lodge loaded with all manner of impossible things including an armful of turkish towels and a box of mustard plasters and as the two girls had known each other somewhat before louise brightened perceptibly when she saw her
when the doctor from englewoodthe casanova doctor doctor walker being awayhad started for sunnyside and i had got thomas to stop trying to explain what he did not understand himself i had a long talk with the old man and this is what i learned
on saturday evening before about ten oclock he had been reading in the sittingroom downstairs when some one rapped at the door
the old man was alone warner not having arrived and at first he was uncertain about opening the door
he did so finally and was amazed at being confronted by louise armstrong
thomas was an old family servant having been with the present mrs armstrong since she was a child and he was overwhelmed at seeing louise
he saw that she was excited and tired and he drew her into the sittingroom and made her sit down
after a while he went to the house and brought mrs watson and they talked until late
the old man said louise was in trouble and seemed frightened
mrs watson made some tea and took it to the lodge but louise made them both promise to keep her presence a secret
she had not known that sunnyside was rented and whatever her trouble was this complicated things
she seemed puzzled
her stepfather and her mother were still in californiathat was all she would say about them
why she had run away no one could imagine
mr arnold armstrong was at the greenwood club and at last thomas not knowing what else to do went over there along the path
it was almost midnight
partway over he met armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge
mrs watson had gone to the house for some bedlinen it having been arranged that under the circumstances louise would be better at the lodge until morning
arnold armstrong and louise had a long conference during which he was heard to storm and become very violent
when he left it was after two
he had gone up to the housethomas did not know whyand at three oclock he was shot at the foot of the circular staircase
the following morning louise had been ill she had asked for arnold and was told he had left town
thomas had not the moral courage to tell her of the crime
she refused a doctor and shrank morbidly from having her presence known
mrs watson and thomas had had their hands full and at last rosie had been enlisted to help them
she carried necessary provisionslittle enoughto the lodge and helped to keep the secret
thomas told me quite frankly that he had been anxious to keep louises presence hidden for this reason they had all seen arnold armstrong that night and he himself for one was known to have had no very friendly feeling for the dead man
as to the reason for louises flight from california or why she had not gone to the fitzhughs or to some of her people in town he had no more information than i had
with the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate return of the family things had become more and more impossible
i gathered that thomas was as relieved as i at the turn events had taken
no she did not know of either of the deaths in the family
taken all around i had only substituted one mystery for another
if i knew now why rosie had taken the basket of dishes i did not know who had spoken to her and followed her along the drive
if i knew that louise was in the lodge i did not know why she was there
if i knew that arnold armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before he was murdered i was no nearer the solution of the crime
who was the midnight intruder who had so alarmed liddy and myself
who had fallen down the clothes chute
was gertrudes lover a villain or a victim
time was to answer all these things
louise   the doctor from englewood came very soon and i went up to see the sick girl with him
halsey had gone to supervise the fitting of the car with blankets and pillows and gertrude was opening and airing louises own rooms at the house
her private sittingroom bedroom and dressingroom were as they had been when we came
they occupied the end of the east wing beyond the circular staircase and we had not even opened them
the girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done
when with the help of the doctor who was a fatherly man with a family of girls at home we got her to the house and up the stairs into bed she dropped into a feverish sleep which lasted until morning
doctor stewartthat was the englewood doctorstayed almost all night giving the medicine himself and watching her closely
afterward he told me that she had had a narrow escape from pneumonia and that the cerebral symptoms had been rather alarming
i said i was glad it wasnt an itis of some kind anyhow and he smiled solemnly
he left after breakfast saying that he thought the worst of the danger was over and that she must be kept very quiet
the shock of two deaths i suppose has done this he remarked picking up his case
it has been very deplorable  i hastened to set him right
she does not know of either doctor i said
please do not mention them to her  he looked as surprised as a medical man ever does
i do not know the family he said preparing to get into his top buggy
young walker down in casanova has been attending them
i understand he is going to marry this young lady  you have been misinformed i said stiffly
miss armstrong is going to marry my nephew  the doctor smiled as he picked up the reins
young ladies are changeable these days he said
we thought the wedding was to occur soon
well i will stop in this afternoon to see how my patient is getting along  he drove away then and i stood looking after him
he was a doctor of the old school of the class of family practitioner that is fast dying out a loyal and honorable gentleman who was at once physician and confidential adviser to his patients
when i was a girl we called in the doctor alike when we had measles or when mothers sister died in the far west
he cut out redundant tonsils and brought the babies with the same air of inspiring selfconfidence
nowadays it requires a different specialist for each of these occurrences
when the babies cried old doctor wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm sweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it was earache
when at the end of a year father met him driving in his high sidebar buggy with the white mare ambling along and asked for a bill the doctor used to go home estimate what his services were worth for that period divide it in halfi dont think he kept any booksand send father a statement in a cramped hand on a sheet of ruled white paper
he was an honored guest at all the weddings christenings and funeralsyes funeralsfor every one knew he had done his best and there was no gainsaying the ways of providence
ah well doctor wainwright is gone and i am an elderly woman with an increasing tendency to live in the past
the contrast between my old doctor at home and the casanova doctor frank walker always rouses me to wrath and digression
some time about noon of that day wednesday mrs ogden fitzhugh telephoned me
i have the barest acquaintance with hershe managed to be put on the governing board of the old ladies home and ruins their digestions by sending them icecream and cake on every holiday
beyond that and her reputation at bridge which is insufferably badshe is the worst player at the bridge clubi know little of her
it was she who had taken charge of arnold armstrongs funeral however and i went at once to the telephone
yes i said this is miss innes  miss innes she said volubly i have just received a very strange telegram from my cousin mrs armstrong
her husband died yesterday in california andwait i will read you the message  i knew what was coming and i made up my mind at once
if louise armstrong had a good and sufficient reason for leaving her people and coming home a reason moreover that kept her from going at once to mrs ogden fitzhugh and that brought her to the lodge at sunnyside instead it was not my intention to betray her
louise herself must notify her people
i do not justify myself now but remember i was in a peculiar position toward the armstrong family
i was connected most unpleasantly with a coldblooded crime and my niece and nephew were practically beggared either directly or indirectly through the head of the family
mrs fitzhugh had found the message
paul died yesterday
heart disease she read
wire at once if louise is with you you see miss innes louise must have started east and fanny is alarmed about her  yes i said
louise is not here mrs fitzhugh went on and none of her friendsthe few who are still in townhas seen her
i called you because sunnyside was not rented when she went away and louise might have gone there  i am sorry mrs fitzhugh but i can not help you i said and was immediately filled with compunction
suppose louise grew worse
who was i to play providence in this case
the anxious mother certainly had a right to know that her daughter was in good hands
so i broke in on mrs fitzhughs voluble excuses for disturbing me
mrs
fitzhugh i said
i was going to let you think i knew nothing about louise armstrong but i have changed my mind
louise is here with me there was a clatter of ejaculations at the other end of the wire
she is ill and not able to be moved
moreover she is unable to see any one
i wish you would wire her mother that she is with me and tell her not to worry
no i do not know why she came east  but my dear miss innes mrs fitzhugh began
i cut in ruthlessly
i will send for you as soon as she can see you i said
no she is not in a critical state now but the doctor says she must have absolute quiet  when i had hung up the receiver i sat down to think
so louise had fled from her people in california and had come east alone
it was not a new idea but why had she done it
it occurred to me that doctor walker might be concerned in it might possibly have bothered her with unwelcome attentions but it seemed to me that louise was hardly a girl to take refuge in flight under such circumstances
she had always been highspirited with the wellpoised head and buoyant step of the outdoors girl
it must have been much more in keeping with louises character as i knew it to resent vigorously any unwelcome attentions from doctor walker
it was the suitor whom i should have expected to see in headlong flight not the lady in the case
the puzzle was no clearer at the end of the halfhour
i picked up the morning papers which were still full of the looting of the traders bank the interest at fever height again on account of paul armstrongs death
the bank examiners were working on the books and said nothing for publication john bailey had been released on bond
the body of paul armstrong would arrive sunday and would be buried from the armstrong town house
there were rumors that the dead mans estate had been a comparatively small one
the last paragraph was the important one
walter p broadhurst of the marine bank had produced two hundred american traction bonds which had been placed as security with the marine bank for a loan of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars made to paul armstrong just before his california trip
the bonds were a part of the missing traction bonds from the traders bank
while this involved the late president of the wrecked bank to my mind it by no means cleared its cashier
the gardener mentioned by halsey came out about two oclock in the afternoon and walked up from the station
i was favorably impressed by him
his references were goodhe had been employed by the brays until they went to europe and he looked young and vigorous
he asked for one assistant and i was glad enough to get off so easily
he was a pleasantfaced young fellow with black hair and blue eyes and his name was alexander graham
i have been particular about alex because as i said before he played an important part later
that afternoon i had a new insight into the character of the dead banker
i had my first conversation with louise
she sent for me and against my better judgment i went
there were so many things she could not be told in her weakened condition that i dreaded the interview
it was much easier than i expected however because she asked no questions
gertrude had gone to bed having been up almost all night and halsey was absent on one of those mysterious absences of his that grew more and more frequent as time went on until it culminated in the event of the night of june the tenth
liddy was in attendance in the sickroom
there being little or nothing to do she seemed to spend her time smoothing the wrinkles from the counterpane
louise lay under a field of virgin white folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness and necessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned
liddy heard my approach and came out to meet me
she seemed to be in a perpetual state of gooseflesh and she had got in the habit of looking past me when she talked as if she saw things
it had the effect of making me look over my shoulder to see what she was staring at and was intensely irritating
shes awake liddy said looking uneasily down the circular staircase which was beside me
she was talkin in her sleep something awfulabout dead men and coffins  liddy i said sternly did you breathe a word about everything not being right here  liddys gaze had wandered to the door of the chute now bolted securely
not a word she said beyond asking her a question or two which there was no harm in
she says there never was a ghost known here  i glared at her speechless and closing the door into louises boudoir to liddys great disappointment i went on to the bedroom beyond
whatever paul armstrong had been he had been lavish with his stepdaughter
gertrudes rooms at home were always beautiful apartments but the three rooms in the east wing at sunnyside set apart for the daughter of the house were much more splendid
from the walls to the rugs on the floor from the furniture to the appointments of the bath with its pool sunk in the floor instead of the customary unlovely tub everything was luxurious
in the bedroom louise was watching for me
it was easy to see that she was much improved the flush was going and the peculiar gasping breathing of the night before was now a comfortable and easy respiration
she held out her hand and i took it between both of mine
what can i say to you miss innes she said slowly
to have come like this  i thought she was going to break down but she did not
you are not to think of anything but of getting well i said patting her hand
when you are better i am going to scold you for not coming here at once
this is your home my dear and of all people in the world halseys old aunt ought to make you welcome  she smiled a little sadly i thought
i ought not to see halsey she said
miss innes there are a great many things you will never understand i am afraid
i am an impostor on your sympathy because ii stay here and let you lavish care on me and all the time i know you are going to despise me  nonsense i said briskly
why what would halsey do to me if i even ventured such a thing
he is so big and masterful that if i dared to be anything but rapturous over you he would throw me out of a window
indeed he would be quite capable of it  she seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone
she had eloquent brown eyesthe inneses are fair and are prone to a grayishgreen optic that is better for use than appearanceand they seemed now to be clouded with trouble
poor halsey she said softly
miss innes i can not marry him and i am afraid to tell him
i am a cowarda coward  i sat beside the bed and stared at her
she was too ill to argue with and besides sick people take queer fancies
we will talk about that when you are stronger i said gently
but there are some things i must tell you she insisted
you must wonder how i came here and why i stayed hidden at the lodge
dear old thomas has been almost crazy miss innes
i did not know that sunnyside was rented
i knew my mother wished to rent it without telling mystepfather but the news must have reached her after i left
when i started east i had only one ideato be alone with my thoughts for a time to bury myself here
then imust have taken a cold on the train  you came east in clothing suitable for california i said and like all young girls nowadays i dont suppose you wear flannels but she was not listening
miss innes she said has my stepbrother arnold gone away  what do you mean i asked startled
but louise was literal
he didnt come back that night she said and it was so important that i should see him  i believe he has gone away i replied uncertainly
isnt it something that we could attend to instead  but she shook her head
i must do it myself she said dully
my mother must have rented sunnyside without telling my stepfather andmiss innes did you ever hear of any one being wretchedly poor in the midst of luxury
did you ever long and long for moneymoney to use without question money that no one would take you to task about
my mother and i have been surrounded for years with every indulgence everything that would make a display
but we have never had any money miss innes that must have been why mother rented this house
my stepfather pays our bills
its the most maddening humiliating existence in the world
i would love honest poverty better  never mind i said when you and halsey are married you can be as honest as you like and you will certainly be poor  halsey came to the door at that moment and i could hear him coaxing liddy for admission to the sick room
shall i bring him in i asked louise uncertain what to do
the girl seemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice
i was vaguely irritated with her there are few young fellows like halseystraightforward honest and willing to sacrifice everything for the one woman
i knew one once more than thirty years ago who was like that he died a long time ago
and sometimes i take out his picture with its cane and its queer silk hat and look at it
but of late years it has grown too painful he is always a boyand i am an old woman
i would not bring him back if i could
perhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply
come in halsey and then i took my sewing and went into the boudoir beyond to play propriety
i did not try to hear what they said but every word came through the open door with curious distinctness
halsey had evidently gone over to the bed and i suppose he kissed her
there was silence for a moment as if words were superfluous things
i have been almost wild sweethearthalseys voice
why didnt you trust me and send for me before  it was because i couldnt trust myself she said in a low tone
i am too weak to struggle today oh halsey how i have wanted to see you  there was something i did not hear then halsey again
we could go away he was saying
what does it matter about any one in the world but just the two of us
to be always together like this hand in hand louisedont tell me it isnt going to be
i wont believe you  you dont know you dont know louise repeated dully
halsey i careyou know thatbutnot enough to marry you  that is not true louise he said sternly
you can not look at me with your honest eyes and say that  i can not marry you she repeated miserably
its bad enough isnt it
dont make it worse
some day before long you will be glad  then it is because you have never loved me there were depths of hurt pride in his voice
you saw how much i loved you and you let me think you caredfor a while
nothat isnt like you louise
there is something you havent told me
is itbecause there is some one else  yes almost inaudibly
louise
oh i dont believe it  it is true she said sadly
halsey you must not try to see me again
as soon as i can i am going away from herewhere you are all so much kinder than i deserve
and whatever you hear about me try to think as well of me as you can
i am going to marryanother man
how you must hate mehate me  i could hear halsey cross the room to the window
then after a pause he went back to her again
i could hardly sit still i wanted to go in and give her a good shaking
then its all over he was saying with a long breath
the plans we made together the hopes theall of itover
well ill not be a baby and ill give you up the minute you say i dont love you and i do lovesome one else  i can not say that she breathed but very soon i shall marrythe other man  i could hear halseys low triumphant laugh
i defy him he said
sweetheart as long as you care for me i am not afraid  the wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then and i could hear nothing more although i moved my chair quite close
after a discreet interval i went into the other room and found louise alone
she was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over the bed and because she looked tired i did not disturb her
an eggnog and a telegram   we had discovered louise at the lodge tuesday night
it was wednesday i had my interview with her
thursday and friday were uneventful save as they marked improvement in our patient
gertrude spent almost all the time with her and the two had grown to be great friends
but certain things hung over me constantly the coroners inquest on the death of arnold armstrong to be held saturday and the arrival of mrs armstrong and young doctor walker bringing the body of the dead president of the traders bank
we had not told louise of either death
then too i was anxious about the children
with their mothers inheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank and with their love affairs in a disastrous condition things could scarcely be worse
added to that the cook and liddy had a flareup over the proper way to make beeftea for louise and of course the cook left
mrs watson had been glad enough i think to turn louise over to our care and thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young mistress from the doorway
poor thomas
he had the facultyfound still in some old negroes who cling to the traditions of slavery daysof making his employers interest his
it was always we with thomas i miss him sorely pipesmoking obsequious not over reliable kindly old man
on thursday mr harton the armstrongs legal adviser called up from town
he had been advised he said that mrs armstrong was coming east with her husbands body and would arrive monday
he came with some hesitation he went on to the fact that he had been further instructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on sunnyside as it was mrs armstrongs desire to come directly there
i was aghast
here i said
surely you are mistaken mr harton
i should think afterwhat happened here only a few days ago she would never wish to come back  nevertheless he replied she is most anxious to come
this is what she says
use every possible means to have sunnyside vacated
must go there at once  mr
harton i said testily i am not going to do anything of the kind
i and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family
i rented the house at an exorbitant figure and i have moved out here for the summer
my city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators
i have been here one week during which i have had not a single night of uninterrupted sleep and i intend to stay until i have recuperated
moreover if mr armstrong died insolvent as i believe was the case his widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of property  the lawyer cleared his throat
i am very sorry you have made this decision he said
miss innes mrs fitzhugh tells me louise armstrong is with you  she is  has she been informed of thisdouble bereavement  not yet i said
she has been very ill perhaps tonight she can be told  it is very sad very sad he said
i have a telegram for her mrs innes
shall i send it out  better open it and read it to me i suggested
if it is important that will save time  there was a pause while mr harton opened the telegram
then he read it slowly judicially
watch for nina carrington
home monday
signed f l w  hum i said
watch for nina carrington
home monday very well mr harton i will tell her but she is not in condition to watch for any one  well miss innes if you decide toerrelinquish the lease let me know the lawyer said
i shall not relinquish it i replied and i imagined his irritation from the way he hung up the receiver
i wrote the telegram down word for word afraid to trust my memory and decided to ask doctor stewart how soon louise might be told the truth
the closing of the traders bank i considered unnecessary for her to know but the death of her stepfather and stepbrother must be broken to her soon or she might hear it in some unexpected and shocking manner
doctor stewart came about four oclock bringing his leather satchel into the house with a great deal of care and opening it at the foot of the stairs to show me a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bottles
real eggs he said proudly
none of your anemic store eggs but the real thingsome of them still warm
feel them
eggnog for miss louise  he was beaming with satisfaction and before he left he insisted on going back to the pantry and making an eggnog with his own hands
somehow all the time he was doing it i had a vision of doctor willoughby my nerve specialist in the city trying to make an eggnog
i wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeianand so delicious
and while doctor stewart whisked the eggs he talked
i said to mrs stewart he confided a little red in the face from the exertion after i went home the other day that you would think me an old gossip for saying what i did about walker and miss louise  nothing of the sort i protested
the fact is he went on evidently justifying him self i got that piece of information just as we get a lot of things through the kitchen end of the house
young walkers chauffeurwalkers more fashionable than i am and he goes around the country in a stanhope carwell his chauffeur comes to see our servant girl and he told her the whole thing
i thought it was probable because walker spent a lot of time up here last summer when the family was here and besides riggs thats walkers man had a very pat little story about the doctors building a house on this property just at the foot of the hill
the sugar please  the eggnog was finished
drop by drop the liquor had cooked the egg and now with a final whisk a last toss in the shaker it was ready a symphony in gold and white
the doctor sniffed it
real eggs real milk and a touch of real kentucky whisky he said
he insisted on carrying it up himself but at the foot of the stairs he paused
riggs said the plans were drawn for the house he said harking back to the old subject
drawn by huston in town
so i naturally believed him  when the doctor came down i was ready with a question
doctor i asked is there any one in the neighborhood named carrington
nina carrington  carrington he wrinkled his forehead
carrington
no i dont remember any such family
there used to be covingtons down the creek  the name was carrington i said and the subject lapsed
gertrude and halsey went for a long walk that afternoon and louise slept
time hung heavy on my hands and i did as i had fallen into a habit of doing latelyi sat down and thought things over
one result of my meditations was that i got up suddenly and went to the telephone
i had taken the most intense dislike to this doctor walker whom i had never seen and who was being talked of in the countryside as the fiance of louise armstrong
i knew sam huston well
there had been a time when sam was a good deal younger than he is now before he had married anne endicott when i knew him even better
so now i felt no hesitation in calling him over the telephone
but when his office boy had given way to his confidential clerk and that functionary had condescended to connect his employers desk telephone i was somewhat at a loss as to how to begin
why how are you rachel sam said sonorously
going to build that house at rock view it was a twentyyearold joke of his
sometime perhaps i said
just now i want to ask you a question about something which is none of my business  i see you havent changed an iota in a quarter of a century rachel this was intended to be another jest
ask ahead everything but my domestic affairs is at your service  try to be serious i said
and tell me this has your firm made any plans for a house recently for a doctor walker at casanova  yes we have  where was it to be built
i have a reason for asking  it was to be i believe on the armstrong place
mr armstrong himself consulted me and the inference wasin fact i am quite certainthe house was to be occupied by mr armstrongs daughter who was engaged to marry doctor walker  when the architect had inquired for the different members of my family and had finally rung off i was certain of one thing
louise armstrong was in love with halsey and the man she was going to marry was doctor walker
moreover this decision was not new marriage had been contemplated for some time
there must certainly be some explanationbut what was it
that day i repeated to louise the telegram mr warton had opened
she seemed to understand but an unhappier face i have never seen
she looked like a criminal whose reprieve is over and the day of execution approaching
liddy gives the alarm   the next day friday gertrude broke the news of her stepfathers death to louise
she did it as gently as she could telling her first that he was very ill and finally that he was dead
louise received the news in the most unexpected manner and when gertrude came out to tell me how she had stood it i think she was almost shocked
she just lay and stared at me aunt ray she said
do you know i believe she is glad glad
and she is too honest to pretend anything else
what sort of man was mr paul armstrong anyhow  he was a bully as well as a rascal gertrude i said
but i am convinced of one thing louise will send for halsey now and they will make it all up  for louise had steadily refused to see halsey all that day and the boy was frantic
we had a quiet hour halsey and i that evening and i told him several things about the request that we give up the lease to sunnyside about the telegram to louise about the rumors of an approaching marriage between the girl and doctor walker and last of all my own interview with her the day before
he sat back in a big chair with his face in the shadow and my heart fairly ached for him
he was so big and so boyish
when i had finished he drew a long breath
whatever louise does he said nothing will convince me aunt ray that she doesnt care for me
and up to two months ago when she and her mother went west i was the happiest fellow on earth
then something made a difference she wrote me that her people were opposed to the marriage that her feeling for me was what it had always been but that something had happened which had changed her ideas as to the future
i was not to write until she wrote me and whatever occurred i was to think the best i could of her
it sounded like a puzzle
when i saw her yesterday it was the same thing only perhaps worse  halsey i asked have you any idea of the nature of the interview between louise armstrong and arnold the night he was murdered  it was stormy
thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the room he was so alarmed for louise  another thing halsey i said have you ever heard louise mention a woman named carrington nina carrington  never he said positively
for try as we would our thoughts always came back to that fatal saturday night and the murder
every conversational path led to it and we all felt that jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence around john bailey
the detectives absence was hardly reassuring he must have had something to work on in town or he would have returned
the papers reported that the cashier of the traders bank was ill in his apartments at the knickerbockera condition not surprising considering everything
the guilt of the defunct president was no longer in doubt the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them discovered
in every instance they had been used as collateral for large loans and the belief was current that not less than a million and a half dollars had been realized
every one connected with the bank had been placed under arrest and released on heavy bond
was he alone in his guilt or was the cashier his accomplice
where was the money
the estate of the dead man was comparatively smalla city house on a fashionable street sunnyside a large estate largely mortgaged an insurance of fifty thousand dollars and some personal propertythis was all
the rest lost in speculation probably the papers said
there was one thing which looked uncomfortable for jack bailey he and paul armstrong together had promoted a railroad company in new mexico and it was rumored that together they had sunk large sums of money there
the business alliance between the two men added to the belief that bailey knew something of the looting
his unexplained absence from the bank on monday lent color to the suspicion against him
the strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure
to me it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal
i was not actively antagonistic to gertrudes lover but i meant to be convinced one way or the other
i took no one on faith
that night the sunnyside ghost began to walk again
liddy had been sleeping in louises dressingroom on a couch and the approach of dusk was a signal for her to barricade the entire suite
situated as it was beyond the circular staircase nothing but an extremity of excitement would have made her pass it after dark
i confess myself that the place seemed to me to have a sinister appearance but we kept that wing well lighted and until the lights went out at midnight it was really cheerful if one did not know its history
on friday night then i had gone to bed resolved to go at once to sleep
thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves i pushed resolutely to the back of my mind and i systematically relaxed every muscle
i fell asleep soon and was dreaming that doctor walker was building his new house immediately in front of my windows i could hear the thumpthump of the hammers and then i waked to a knowledge that somebody was pounding on my door
i was up at once and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the low knocking ceased to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering through the keyhole
miss rachel
miss rachel somebody was saying over and over
is that you liddy i asked my hand on the knob
for the love of mercy let me in she said in a low tone
she was leaning against the door for when i opened it she fell in
she was greenishwhite and she had a red and black barred flannel petticoat over her shoulders
listen she said standing in the middle of the floor and holding on to me
oh miss rachel its the ghost of that dead man hammering to get in  sure enough there was a dull thudthudthud from some place near
it was muffled one rather felt than heard it and it was impossible to locate
one moment it seemed to come three taps and a pause from the floor under us the next thudthudthudit came apparently from the wall
its not a ghost i said decidedly
if it was a ghost it wouldnt rap it would come through the keyhole liddy looked at the keyhole
but it sounds very much as though some one is trying to break into the house  liddy was shivering violently
i told her to get me my slippers and she brought me a pair of kid gloves so i found my things myself and prepared to call halsey
as before the night alarm had found the electric lights gone the hall save for its night lamp was in darkness as i went across to halseys room
i hardly know what i feared but it was a relief to find him there very sound asleep and with his door unlocked
wake up halsey i said shaking him
he stirred a little
liddy was half in and half out of the door afraid as usual to be left alone and not quite daring to enter
her scruples seemed to fade however all at once
she gave a suppressed yell bolted into the room and stood tightly clutching the footboard of the bed
halsey was gradually waking
ive seen it liddy wailed
a woman in white down the hall  i paid no attention
halsey i persevered some one is breaking into the house
get up wont you  it isnt our house he said sleepily
and then he roused to the exigency of the occasion
all right aunt ray he said still yawning
if youll let me get into something  it was all i could do to get liddy out of the room
the demands of the occasion had no influence on her she had seen the ghost she persisted and she wasnt going into the hall
but i got her over to my room at last more dead than alive and made her lie down on the bed
the tappings which seemed to have ceased for a while had commenced again but they were fainter
halsey came over in a few minutes and stood listening and trying to locate the sound
give me my revolver aunt ray he said and i got itthe one i had found in the tulip bedand gave it to him
he saw liddy there and divined at once that louise was alone
you let me attend to this fellow whoever it is aunt ray and go to louise will you
she may be awake and alarmed  so in spite of her protests i left liddy alone and went back to the east wing
perhaps i went a little faster past the yawning blackness of the circular staircase and i could hear halsey creaking cautiously down the main staircase
the rapping or pounding had ceased and the silence was almost painful
and then suddenly from apparently under my very feet there rose a womans scream a cry of terror that broke off as suddenly as it came
i stood frozen and still
every drop of blood in my body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart
in the dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst
more dead than alive i stumbled into louises bedroom
she was not there
in the early morning   i stood looking at the empty bed
the coverings had been thrown back and louises pink silk dressinggown was gone from the foot where it had lain
the night lamp burned dimly revealing the emptiness of the place
i picked it up but my hand shook so that i put it down again and got somehow to the door
there were voices in the hall and gertrude came running toward me
what is it she cried
what was that sound
where is louise  she is not in her room i said stupidly
i thinkit was shewho screamed  liddy had joined us now carrying a light
we stood huddled together at the head of the circular staircase looking down into its shadows
there was nothing to be seen and it was absolutely quiet down there
then we heard halsey running up the main staircase
he came quickly down the hall to where we were standing
theres no one trying to get in
i thought i heard some one shriek
who was it  our stricken faces told him the truth
some one screamed down there i said
andand louise is not in her room  with a jerk halsey took the light from liddy and ran down the circular staircase
i followed him more slowly
my nerves seemed to be in a state of paralysis i could scarcely step
at the foot of the stairs halsey gave an exclamation and put down the light
aunt ray he called sharply
at the foot of the staircase huddled in a heap her head on the lower stair was louise armstrong
she lay limp and white her dressinggown dragging loose from one sleeve of her nightdress and the heavy braid of her dark hair stretching its length a couple of steps above her head as if she had slipped down
she was not dead halsey put her down on the floor and began to rub her cold hands while gertrude and liddy ran for stimulants
as for me i sat there at the foot of that ghostly staircasesat because my knees wouldnt hold meand wondered where it would all end
louise was still unconscious but she was breathing better and i suggested that we get her back to bed before she came to
there was something grisly and horrible to me seeing her there in almost the same attitude and in the same place where we had found her brothers body
and to add to the similarity just then the hall clock far off struck faintly three oclock
it was four before louise was able to talk and the first rays of dawn were coming through her windows which faced the east before she could tell us coherently what had occurred
i give it as she told it
she lay propped in bed and halsey sat beside her unrebuffed and held her hand while she talked
i was not sleeping well she began partly i think because i had slept during the afternoon
liddy brought me some hot milk at ten oclock and i slept until twelve
then i wakened andi got to thinking about things and worrying so i could not go to sleep
i was wondering why i had not heard from arnold since thesince i saw him that night at the lodge
i was afraid he was ill becausehe was to have done something for me and he had not come back
it must have been three when i heard some one rapping
i sat up and listened to be quite sure and the rapping kept up
it was cautious and i was about to call liddy
then suddenly i thought i knew what it was
the east entrance and the circular staircase were always used by arnold when he was out late and sometimes when he forgot his key he would rap and i would go down and let him in
i thought he had come back to see mei didnt think about the time for his hours were always erratic
but i was afraid i was too weak to get down the stairs
the knocking kept up and just as i was about to call liddy she ran through the room and out into the hall
i got up then feeling weak and dizzy and put on my dressinggown
if it was arnold i knew i must see him
it was very dark everywhere but of course i knew my way
i felt along for the stairrail and went down as quickly as i could
the knocking had stopped and i was afraid i was too late
i got to the foot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda
i had never thought of anything but that it was arnold until i reached the door
it was unlocked and opened about an inch
everything was black it was perfectly dark outside
i felt very queer and shaky
then i thought perhaps arnold had used his key he didstrange things sometimes and i turned around
just as i reached the foot of the staircase i thought i heard some one coming
my nerves were going anyhow there in the dark and i could scarcely stand
i got up as far as the third or fourth step then i felt that some one was coming toward me on the staircase
the next instant a hand met mine on the stairrail
some one brushed past me and i screamed
then i must have fainted  that was louises story
there could be no doubt of its truth and the thing that made it inexpressibly awful to me was that the poor girl had crept down to answer the summons of a brother who would never need her kindly offices again
twice now without apparent cause some one had entered the house by means of the east entrance had apparently gone his way unhindered through the house and gone out again as he had entered
had this unknown visitor been there a third time the night arnold armstrong was murdered
or a fourth the time mr jamieson had locked some one in the clothes chute
sleep was impossible i think for any of us
we dispersed finally to bathe and dress leaving louise little the worse for her experience
but i determined that before the day was over she must know the true state of affairs
another decision i made and i put it into execution immediately after breakfast
i had one of the unused bedrooms in the east wing back along the small corridor prepared for occupancy and from that time on alex the gardener slept there
one man in that barn of a house was an absurdity with things happening all the time and i must say that alex was as unobjectionable as any one could possibly have been
the next morning also halsey and i made an exhaustive examination of the circular staircase the small entry at its foot and the cardroom opening from it
there was no evidence of anything unusual the night before and had we not ourselves heard the rapping noises i should have felt that louises imagination had run away with her
the outer door was closed and locked and the staircase curved above us for all the world like any other staircase
halsey who had never taken seriously my account of the night liddy and i were there alone was grave enough now
he examined the paneling of the wainscoting above and below the stairs evidently looking for a secret door and suddenly there flashed into my mind the recollection of a scrap of paper that mr jamieson had found among arnold armstrongs effects
as nearly as possible i repeated its contents to him while halsey took them down in a notebook
i wish you had told me that before he said as he put the memorandum carefully away
we found nothing at all in the house and i expected little from any examination of the porch and grounds
but as we opened the outer door something fell into the entry with a clatter
it was a cue from the billiardroom
halsey picked it up with an exclamation
thats careless enough he said
some of the servants have been amusing themselves  i was far from convinced
not one of the servants would go into that wing at night unless driven by dire necessity
and a billiard cue
as a weapon of either offense or defense it was an absurdity unless one accepted liddys hypothesis of a ghost and even then as halsey pointed out a billiardplaying ghost would be a very modern evolution of an ancient institution
that afternoon we gertrude halsey and i attended the coroners inquest in town
doctor stewart had been summoned also it transpiring that in that early sunday morning when gertrude and i had gone to our rooms he had been called to view the body
we went the four of us in the machine preferring the execrable roads to the matinee train with half of casanova staring at us
and on the way we decided to say nothing of louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he died
the girl was in trouble enough as it was
a hint of scandal   in giving the gist of what happened at the inquest i have only one excuseto recall to the reader the events of the night of arnold armstrongs murder
many things had occurred which were not brought out at the inquest and some things were told there that were new to me
altogether it was a gloomy affair and the six men in the corner who constituted the coroners jury were evidently the merest puppets in the hands of that allpowerful gentleman the coroner
gertrude and i sat well back with our veils down
there were a number of people i knew barbara fitzhugh in extravagant mourningshe always went into black on the slightest provocation because it was becomingand mr jarvis the man who had come over from the greenwood club the night of the murder
mr harton was there too looking impatient as the inquest dragged but alive to every particle of evidence
from a corner mr jamieson was watching the proceedings intently
doctor stewart was called first
his evidence was told briefly and amounted to this on the sunday morning previous at a quarter before five he had been called to the telephone
the message was from a mr jarvis who asked him to come at once to sunnyside as there had been an accident there and mr arnold armstrong had been shot
he had dressed hastily gathered up some instruments and driven to sunnyside
he was met by mr jarvis who took him at once to the east wing
there just as he had fallen was the body of arnold armstrong
there was no need of the instruments the man was dead
in answer to the coroners questionno the body had not been moved save to turn it over
it lay at the foot of the circular staircase
yes he believed death had been instantaneous
the body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis had not set in
it occurred late in cases of sudden death
no he believed the probability of suicide might be eliminated the wounds could have been selfinflicted but with difficulty and there had been no weapon found
the doctors examination was over but he hesitated and cleared his throat
mr
coroner he said at the risk of taking up valuable time i would like to speak of an incident that may or may not throw some light on this matter  the audience was alert at once
kindly proceed doctor the coroner said
my home is in englewood two miles from casanova the doctor began
in the absence of doctor walker a number of casanova people have been consulting me
a month agofive weeks to be exacta woman whom i had never seen came to my office
she was in deep mourning and kept her veil down and she brought for examination a child a boy of six
the little fellow was ill it looked like typhoid and the mother was frantic
she wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the childrens hospital in town here where i am a member of the staff and i gave her one
the incident would have escaped me but for a curious thing
two days before mr armstrong was shot i was sent for to go to the country club some one had been struck with a golfball that had gone wild
it was late when i lefti was on foot and about a mile from the club on the claysburg road i met two people
they were disputing violently and i had no difficulty in recognizing mr armstrong
the woman beyond doubt was the one who had consulted me about the child  at this hint of scandal mrs ogden fitzhugh sat up very straight
jamieson was looking slightly skeptical and the coroner made a note
the childrens hospital you say doctor he asked
yes
but the child who was entered as lucien wallace was taken away by his mother two weeks ago
i have tried to trace them and failed  all at once i remembered the telegram sent to louise by some one signed f l wpresumably doctor walker
could this veiled woman be the nina carrington of the message
but it was only idle speculation
i had no way of finding out and the inquest was proceeding
the report of the coroners physician came next
the postmortem examination showed that the bullet had entered the chest in the fourth left intercostal space and had taken an oblique course downward and backward piercing both the heart and lungs
the left lung was collapsed and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the spinal column
it was improbable that such a wound had been selfinflicted and its oblique downward course pointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above
in other words as the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a staircase it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one higher up on the stairs
there were no marks of powder
the bullet a thirtyeight caliber had been found in the dead mans clothing and was shown to the jury
mr jarvis was called next but his testimony amounted to little
he had been summoned by telephone to sunnyside had come over at once with the steward and mr winthrop at present out of town
they had been admitted by the housekeeper and had found the body lying at the foot of the staircase
he had made a search for a weapon but there was none around
the outer entry door in the east wing had been unfastened and was open about an inch
i had been growing more and more nervous
when the coroner called mr john bailey the room was filled with suppressed excitement
mr jamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner who nodded
then halsey was called
mr
innes the coroner said will you tell under what circumstances you saw mr arnold armstrong the night he died  i saw him first at the country club halsey said quietly
he was rather pale but very composed
i stopped there with my automobile for gasolene
mr armstrong had been playing cards
when i saw him there he was coming out of the cardroom talking to mr john bailey  the nature of the discussionwas it amicable  halsey hesitated
they were having a dispute he said
i asked mr bailey to leave the club with me and come to sunnyside over sunday  isnt it a fact mr innes that you took mr bailey away from the clubhouse because you were afraid there would be blows  the situation was unpleasant halsey said evasively
at that time had you any suspicion that the traders bank had been wrecked  no  what occurred next  mr
bailey and i talked in the billiardroom until twothirty  and mr arnold armstrong came there while you were talking  yes
he came about halfpast two
he rapped at the east door and i admitted him  the silence in the room was intense
mr jamiesons eyes never left halseys face
will you tell us the nature of his errand  he brought a telegram that had come to the club for mr bailey  he was sober  perfectly at that time
not earlier  was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude  yes
i did not understand it  how long did he stay  about five minutes
then he left by the east entrance  what occurred then  we talked for a few minutes discussing a plan mr bailey had in mind
then i went to the stables where i kept my car and got it out  leaving mr bailey alone in the billiardroom  halsey hesitated
my sister was there  mrs ogden fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye gertrude through her lorgnon
and then  i took the car along the lower road not to disturb the household
mr bailey came down across the lawn through the hedge and got into the car on the road  then you know nothing of mr armstrongs movements after he left the house  nothing
i read of his death monday evening for the first time  mr
bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn  i think not
if he had seen him he would have spoken of it  thank you
that is all
miss gertrude innes  gertrudes replies were fully as concise as halseys
mrs fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection commencing with her hat and ending with her shoes
i flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either her gown or her manner but poor gertrudes testimony was the reverse of comforting
she had been summoned she said by her brother after mr armstrong had gone
she had waited in the billiardroom with mr bailey until the automobile had been ready
then she had locked the door at the foot of the staircase and taking a lamp had accompanied mr bailey to the main entrance of the house and had watched him cross the lawn
instead of going at once to her room she had gone back to the billiardroom for something which had been left there
the cardroom and billiardroom were in darkness
she had groped around found the article she was looking for and was on the point of returning to her room when she had heard some one fumbling at the lock at the east outer door
she had thought it was probably her brother and had been about to go to the door when she heard it open
almost immediately there was a shot and she had run panicstricken through the drawingroom and had roused the house
you heard no other sound the coroner asked
there was no one with mr armstrong when he entered  it was perfectly dark
there were no voices and i heard nothing
there was just the opening of the door the shot and the sound of somebody falling  then while you went through the drawingroom and upstairs to alarm the household the criminal whoever it was could have escaped by the east door  yes  thank you
that will do  i flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me
i saw mr jamieson smiling to himself and the coroner gave me up after a time
i admitted i had found the body said i had not known who it was until mr jarvis told me and ended by looking up at barbara fitzhugh and saying that in renting the house i had not expected to be involved in any family scandal
at which she turned purple
the verdict was that arnold armstrong had met his death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and we all prepared to leave
barbara fitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me but mr harton came up as i knew he would
you have decided to give up the house i hope miss innes he said
mrs
armstrong has wired me again  i am not going to give it up i maintained until i understand some things that are puzzling me
the day that the murderer is discovered i will leave  then judging by what i have heard you will be back in the city very soon he said
and i knew that he suspected the discredited cashier of the traders bank
mr jamieson came up to me as i was about to leave the coroners office
how is your patient he asked with his odd little smile
i have no patient i replied startled
i will put it in a different way then
how is miss armstrong  sheshe is doing very well i stammered
good cheerfully
and our ghost
is it laid  mr
jamieson i said suddenly i wish you would do one thing i wish you would come to sunnyside and spend a few days there
the ghost is not laid
i want you to spend one night at least watching the circular staircase
the murder of arnold armstrong was a beginning not an end  he looked serious
perhaps i can do it he said
i have been doing something else butwell i will come out tonight  we were very silent during the trip back to sunnyside
i watched gertrude closely and somewhat sadly
to me there was one glaring flaw in her story and it seemed to stand out for every one to see
arnold armstrong had had no key and yet she said she had locked the east door
he must have been admitted from within the house over and over i repeated it to myself
that night as gently as i could i told louise the story of her stepbrothers death
she sat in her big pillowfilled chair and heard me through without interruption
it was clear that she was shocked beyond words if i had hoped to learn anything from her expression i had failed
she was as much in the dark as we were
a hole in the wall   my taking the detective out to sunnyside raised an unexpected storm of protest from gertrude and halsey
i was not prepared for it and i scarcely knew how to account for it
to me mr jamieson was far less formidable under my eyes where i knew what he was doing than he was off in the city twisting circumstances and motives to suit himself and learning what he wished to know about events at sunnyside in some occult way
i was glad enough to have him there when excitements began to come thick and fast
a new element was about to enter into affairs monday or tuesday at the latest would find doctor walker back in his green and white house in the village and louises attitude to him in the immediate future would signify halseys happiness or wretchedness as it might turn out
then too the return of her mother would mean of course that she would have to leave us and i had become greatly attached to her
from the day mr jamieson came to sunnyside there was a subtle change in gertrudes manner to me
it was elusive difficult to analyze but it was there
she was no longer frank with me although i think her affection never wavered
at the time i laid the change to the fact that i had forbidden all communication with john bailey and had refused to acknowledge any engagement between the two
gertrude spent much of her time wandering through the grounds or taking long crosscountry walks
halsey played golf at the country club day after day and after louise left as she did the following week mr jamieson and i were much together
he played a fair game of cribbage but he cheated at solitaire
the night the detective arrived saturday i had a talk with him
i told him of the experience louise armstrong had had the night before on the circular staircase and about the man who had so frightened rosie on the drive
i saw that he thought the information was important and to my suggestion that we put an additional lock on the east wing door he opposed a strong negative
i think it probable he said that our visitor will be back again and the thing to do is to leave things exactly as they are to avoid rousing suspicion
then i can watch for at least a part of each night and probably mr innes will help us out
i would say as little to thomas as possible
the old man knows more than he is willing to admit  i suggested that alex the gardener would probably be willing to help and mr jamieson undertook to make the arrangement
for one night however mr jamieson preferred to watch alone
apparently nothing occurred
the detective sat in absolute darkness on the lower step of the stairs dozing he said afterwards now and then
nothing could pass him in either direction and the door in the morning remained as securely fastened as it had been the night before
and yet one of the most inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that very night
liddy came to my room on sunday morning with a face as long as the moral law
she laid out my things as usual but i missed her customary garrulousness
i was not regaled with the new cooks extravagance as to eggs and she even forbore to mention that jamieson on whose arrival she had looked with silent disfavor
whats the matter liddy i asked at last
didnt you sleep last night  no mam she said stiffly
did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner i inquired
no mam indignantly
i sat up and almost upset my hot wateri always take a cup of hot water with a pinch of salt before i get up
it tones the stomach
liddy allen i said stop combing that switch and tell me what is wrong with you  liddy heaved a sigh
girl and woman she said ive been with you twentyfive years miss rachel through good temper and bad the idea
and what i have taken from her in the way of sulksbut i guess i cant stand it any longer
my trunks packed  who packed it i asked expecting from her tone to be told she had wakened to find it done by some ghostly hand
i did miss rachel you wont believe me when i tell you this house is haunted
who was it fell down the clothes chute
who was it scared miss louise almost into her grave  im doing my best to find out i said
what in the world are you driving at she drew a long breath
there is a hole in the trunkroom wall dug out since last night
its big enough to put your head in and the plasters all over the place  nonsense i said
plaster is always falling  but liddy clenched that
just ask alex she said
when he put the new cooks trunk there last night the wall was as smooth as this
this morning its dug out and theres plaster on the cooks trunk
miss rachel you can get a dozen detectives and put one on every stair in the house and youll never catch anything
theres some things you cant handcuff  liddy was right
as soon as i could i went up to the trunkroom which was directly over my bedroom
the plan of the upper story of the house was like that of the second floor in the main
one end however over the east wing had been left only roughly finished the intention having been to convert it into a ballroom at some future time
the maids rooms trunkroom and various storerooms including a large airy linenroom opened from a long corridor like that on the second floor
and in the trunkroom as liddy had said was a fresh break in the plaster
not only in the plaster but through the lathing the aperture extended
i reached into the opening and three feet away perhaps i could touch the bricks of the partition wall
for some reason the architect in building the house had left a space there that struck me even in the surprise of the discovery as an excellent place for a conflagration to gain headway
you are sure the hole was not here yesterday i asked liddy whose expression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm
in answer she pointed to the new cooks trunkthat necessary adjunct of the migratory domestic
the top was covered with fine white plaster as was the floor
but there were no large pieces of mortar lying aroundno bits of lathing
when i mentioned this to liddy she merely raised her eyebrows
being quite confident that the gap was of unholy origin she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of mortar and lath
no doubt they were even then heaped neatly on a gravestone in the casanova churchyard
i brought mr jamieson up to see the hole in the wall directly after breakfast
his expression was very odd when he looked at it and the first thing he did was to try to discover what object if any such a hole could have
he got a piece of candle and by enlarging the aperture a little was able to examine what lay beyond
the result was nil
the trunkroom although heated by steam heat like the rest of the house boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well
the opening had been made between the flue and the outer wall of the house
there was revealed however on inspection only the brick of the chimney on one side and the outer wall of the house on the other in depth the space extended only to the flooring
the breach had been made about four feet from the floor and inside were all the missing bits of plaster
it had been a methodical ghost
it was very much of a disappointment
i had expected a secret room at the very least and i think even mr jamieson had fancied he might at last have a clue to the mystery
there was evidently nothing more to be discovered liddy reported that everything was serene among the servants and that none of them had been disturbed by the noise
the maddening thing however was that the nightly visitor had evidently more than one way of gaining access to the house and we made arrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows and doors that night
halsey was inclined to poohpooh the whole affair
he said a break in the plaster might have occurred months ago and gone unnoticed and that the dust had probably been stirred up the day before
after all we had to let it go at that but we put in an uncomfortable sunday
gertrude went to church and halsey took a long walk in the morning
louise was able to sit up and she allowed halsey and liddy to assist her downstairs late in the afternoon
the east veranda was shady green with vines and palms cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs
we put louise in a steamer chair and she sat there passively enough her hands clasped in her lap
we were very silent
halsey sat on the rail with a pipe openly watching louise as she looked broodingly across the valley to the hills
there was something baffling in the girls eyes and gradually halseys boyish features lost their glow at seeing her about again and settled into grim lines
he was like his father just then
we sat until late afternoon halsey growing more and more moody
shortly before six he got up and went into the house and in a few minutes he came out and called me to the telephone
it was anna whitcomb in town and she kept me for twenty minutes telling me the children had had the measles and how madame sweeny had botched her new gown
when i finished liddy was behind me her mouth a thin line
i wish you would try to look cheerful liddy i groaned your face would sour milk but liddy seldom replied to my gibes
she folded her lips a little tighter
he called her up she said oracularly he called her up and asked her to keep you at the telephone so he could talk to miss louise
a thankless child is sharper than a serpents tooth  nonsense i said bruskly
i might have known enough to leave them
its a long time since you and i were in love liddy andwe forget  liddy sniffed
no man ever made a fool of me she replied virtuously
well something did i retorted
concerning thomas   mr
jamieson i said when we found ourselves alone after dinner that night the inquest yesterday seemed to me the merest recapitulation of things that were already known
it developed nothing new beyond the story of doctor stewarts and that was volunteered  an inquest is only a necessary formality miss innes he replied
unless a crime is committed in the open the inquest does nothing beyond getting evidence from witnesses while events are still in their minds
the police step in later
you and i both know how many important things never transpired
for instance the dead man had no key and yet miss gertrude testified to a fumbling at the lock and then the opening of the door
the piece of evidence you mention doctor stewarts story is one of those things we have to take cautiously the doctor has a patient who wears black and does not raise her veil
why it is the typical mysterious lady
then the good doctor comes across arnold armstrong who was a graceless scampde mortuiswhats the rest of itand he is quarreling with a lady in black
behold says the doctor they are one and the same  why was mr bailey not present at the inquest  the detectives expression was peculiar
because his physician testified that he is ill and unable to leave his bed  ill i exclaimed
why neither halsey nor gertrude has told me that  there are more things than that miss innes that are puzzling
bailey gives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank until he read it in the paper monday night and that he went back and surrendered himself immediately
i do not believe it
jonas the watchman at the traders bank tells a different story
he says that on the thursday night before about eightthirty bailey went back to the bank
jonas admitted him and he says the cashier was in a state almost of collapse
bailey worked until midnight then he closed the vault and went away
the occurrence was so unusual that the watchman pondered over it an the rest of the night
what did bailey do when he went back to the knickerbocker apartments that night
he packed a suitcase ready for instant departure
but he held off too long he waited for something
my personal opinion is that he waited to see miss gertrude before flying from the country
then when he had shot down arnold armstrong that night he had to choose between two evils
he did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his favor and surrendered himself as an innocent man
the strongest thing against him is his preparation for flight and his deciding to come back after the murder of arnold armstrong
he was shrewd enough to disarm suspicion as to the graver charge  the evening dragged along slowly
mrs watson came to my bedroom before i went to bed and asked if i had any arnica
she showed me a badly swollen hand with reddish streaks running toward the elbow she said it was the hand she had hurt the night of the murder a week before and that she had not slept well since
it looked to me as if it might be serious and i told her to let doctor stewart see it
the next morning mrs watson went up to town on the eleven train and was admitted to the charity hospital
she was suffering from bloodpoisoning
i fully meant to go up and see her there but other things drove her entirely from my mind
i telephoned to the hospital that day however and ordered a private room for her and whatever comforts she might be allowed
mrs armstrong arrived monday evening with her husbands body and the services were set for the next day
the house on chestnut street in town had been opened and tuesday morning louise left us to go home
she sent for me before she went and i saw she had been crying
how can i thank you miss innes she said
you have taken me on faith andyou have not asked me any questions
some time perhaps i can tell you and when that time comes you will all despise mehalsey too  i tried to tell her how glad i was to have had her but there was something else she wanted to say
she said it finally when she had bade a constrained goodby to halsey and the car was waiting at the door
miss innes she said in a low tone if theyif there is any attempt made toto have you give up the house do it if you possibly can
i am afraidto have you stay  that was all
gertrude went into town with her and saw her safely home
she reported a decided coolness in the greeting between louise and her mother and that doctor walker was there apparently in charge of the arrangements for the funeral
halsey disappeared shortly after louise left and came home about nine that night muddy and tired
as for thomas he went around dejected and sad and i saw the detective watching him closely at dinner
even now i wonderwhat did thomas know
what did he suspect
at ten oclock the household had settled down for the night
liddy who was taking mrs watsons place had finished examining the teatowels and the corners of the shelves in the coolingroom and had gone to bed
alex the gardener had gone heavily up the circular staircase to his room and mr jamieson was examining the locks of the windows
halsey dropped into a chair in the livingroom and stared moodily ahead
once he roused
what sort of a looking chap is that walker gertrude he asked
rather tall very dark smoothshaven
not bad looking gertrude said putting down the book she had been pretending to read
halsey kicked a taboret viciously
lovely place this village must be in the winter he said irrelevantly
a girl would be buried alive here  it was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front door
halsey got up leisurely and opened it admitting warner
he was out of breath from running and he looked half abashed
i am sorry to disturb you he said
but i didnt know what else to do
its about thomas  what about thomas i asked
mr jamieson had come into the hall and we all stared at warner
hes acting queer warner explained
hes sitting down there on the edge of the porch and he says he has seen a ghost
the old man looks bad too he can scarcely speak  hes as full of superstition as an egg is of meat i said
halsey bring some whisky and we will all go down  no one moved to get the whisky from which i judged there were three pocket flasks ready for emergency
gertrude threw a shawl around my shoulders and we all started down over the hill i had made so many nocturnal excursions around the place that i knew my way perfectly
but thomas was not on the veranda nor was he inside the house
the men exchanged significant glances and warner got a lantern
he cant have gone far he said
he was trembling so that he couldnt stand when i left  jamieson and halsey together made the round of the lodge occasionally calling the old man by name
but there was no response
no thomas came bowing and showing his white teeth through the darkness
i began to be vaguely uneasy for the first time
gertrude who was never nervous in the dark went alone down the drive to the gate and stood there looking along the yellowish line of the road while i waited on the tiny veranda
warner was puzzled
he came around to the edge of the veranda and stood looking at it as if it ought to know and explain
he might have stumbled into the house he said but he could not have climbed the stairs
anyhow hes not inside or outside that i can see the other members of the party had come back now and no one had found any trace of the old man
his pipe still warm rested on the edge of the rail and inside on the table his old gray hat showed that its owner had not gone far
he was not far after all
from the table my eyes traveled around the room and stopped at the door of a closet
i hardly know what impulse moved me but i went in and turned the knob
it burst open with the impetus of a weight behind it and something fell partly forward in a heap on the floor
it was thomasthomas without a mark of injury on him and dead
doctor walkers warning   warner was on his knees in a moment fumbling at the old mans collar to loosen it but halsey caught his hand
let him alone he said
you cant help him he is dead  we stood there each avoiding the others eyes we spoke low and reverently in the presence of death and we tacitly avoided any mention of the suspicion that was in every mind
when mr jamieson had finished his cursory examination he got up and dusted the knees of his trousers
there is no sign of injury he said and i know i for one drew a long breath of relief
from what warner says and from his hiding in the closet i should say he was scared to death
fright and a weak heart together  but what could have done it gertrude asked
he was all right this evening at dinner
warner what did he say when you found him on the porch  warner looked shaken his honest boyish face was colorless
just what i told you miss innes
hed been reading the paper downstairs i had put up the car and feeling sleepy i came down to the lodge to go to bed
as i went upstairs thomas put down the paper and taking his pipe went out on the porch
then i heard an exclamation from him  what did he say demanded jamieson
i couldnt hear but his voice was strange it sounded startled
i waited for him to call out again but he did not so i went downstairs
he was sitting on the porch step looking straight ahead as if he saw something among the trees across the road
and he kept mumbling about having seen a ghost
he looked queer and i tried to get him inside but he wouldnt move
then i thought id better go up to the house  didnt he say anything else you could understand i asked
he said something about the grave giving up its dead  mr jamieson was going through the old mans pockets and gertrude was composing his arms folding them across his white shirtbosom always so spotless
mr jamieson looked up at me
what was that you said to me miss innes about the murder at the house being a beginning and not an end
by jove i believe you were right  in the course of his investigations the detective had come to the inner pocket of the dead butlers black coat
here he found some things that interested him
one was a small flat key with a red cord tied to it and the other was a bit of white paper on which was written something in thomas cramped hand
mr jamieson read it then he gave it to me
it was an address in fresh ink  lucien wallace  elm street richfield
as the card went around i think both the detective and i watched for any possible effect it might have but beyond perplexity there seemed to be none
richfield gertrude exclaimed
why elm street is the main street dont you remember halsey  lucien wallace halsey said
that is the child stewart spoke of at the inquest  warner with his mechanics instinct had reached for the key
what he said was not a surprise
yale lock he said
probably a key to the east entry  there was no reason why thomas an old and trusted servant should not have had a key to that particular door although the servants entry was in the west wing
but i had not known of this key and it opened up a new field of conjecture
just now however there were many things to be attended to and leaving warner with the body we all went back to the house
mr jamieson walked with me while halsey and gertrude followed
i suppose i shall have to notify the armstrongs i said
they will know if thomas had any people and how to reach them
of course i expect to defray the expenses of the funeral but his relatives must be found
what do you think frightened him mr jamieson  it is hard to say he replied slowly but i think we may be certain it was fright and that he was hiding from something
i am sorry in more than one way i have always believed that thomas knew something or suspected something that he would not tell
do you know how much money there was in that wornout wallet of his
nearly a hundred dollars
almost two months wagesand yet those darkies seldom have a penny
wellwhat thomas knew will be buried with him  halsey suggested that the grounds be searched but mr jamieson vetoed the suggestion
you would find nothing he said
a person clever enough to get into sunnyside and tear a hole in the wall while i watched downstairs is not to be found by going around the shrubbery with a lantern  with the death of thomas i felt that a climax had come in affairs at sunnyside
the night that followed was quiet enough
halsey watched at the foot of the staircase and a complicated system of bolts on the other doors seemed to be effectual
once in the night i wakened and thought i heard the tapping again
but all was quiet and i had reached the stage where i refused to be disturbed for minor occurrences
the armstrongs were notified of thomas death and i had my first interview with doctor walker as a result
he came up early the next morning just as we finished breakfast in a professional looking car with a black hood
i found him striding up and down the livingroom and in spite of my preconceived dislike i had to admit that the man was presentable
a big fellow he was tall and dark as gertrude had said smoothshaven and erect with prominent features and a square jaw
he was painfully spruce in his appearance and his manner was almost obtrusively polite
i must make a double excuse for this early visit miss innes he said as he sat down
the chair was lower than he expected and his dignity required collecting before he went on
my professional duties are urgent and long neglected anda fall to the everyday mannersomething must be done about that body  yes i said sitting on the edge of my chair
i merely wished the address of thomas people
you might have telephoned if you were busy  he smiled
i wished to see you about something else he said
as for thomas it is mrs armstrongs wish that you would allow her to attend to the expense
about his relatives i have already notified his brother in the village
it was heart disease i think
thomas always had a bad heart  heart disease and fright i said still on the edge of my chair
but the doctor had no intention of leaving
i understand you have a ghost up here and that you have the house filled with detectives to exorcise it he said
for some reason i felt i was being pumped as halsey says
you have been misinformed i replied
what no ghost no detectives he said still with his smile
what a disappointment to the village  i resented his attempt at playfulness
it had been anything but a joke to us
doctor walker i said tartly i fail to see any humor in the situation
since i came here one man has been shot and another one has died from shock
there have been intruders in the house and strange noises
if that is funny there is something wrong with my sense of humor  you miss the point he said still goodnaturedly
the thing that is funny to me is that you insist on remaining here under the circumstances
i should think nothing would keep you  you are mistaken
everything that occurs only confirms my resolution to stay until the mystery is cleared  i have a message for you miss innes he said rising at last
mrs
armstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to louise whose whim occurring at the time it did put her to great inconvenience
alsoand this is a delicate mattershe asked me to appeal to your natural sympathy for her at this time and to ask you if you will not reconsider your decision about the house
sunnyside is her home she loves it dearly and just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and peace  she must have had a change of heart i said ungraciously enough
louise told me her mother despised the place
besides this is no place for quiet and peace just now
anyhow doctor while i dont care to force an issue i shall certainly remain here for a time at least  for how long he asked
my lease is for six months
i shall stay until some explanation is found for certain things
my own family is implicated now and i shall do everything to clear the mystery of arnold armstrongs murder  the doctor stood looking down slapping his gloves thoughtfully against the palm of a welllookedafter hand
you say there have been intruders in the house he asked
you are sure of that miss innes  certain  in what part  in the east wing  can you tell me when these intrusions occurred and what the purpose seemed to be
was it robbery  no i said decidedly
as to time once on friday night a week ago again the following night when arnold armstrong was murdered and again last friday night  the doctor looked serious
he seemed to be debating some question in his mind and to reach a decision
miss innes he said i am in a peculiar position i understand your attitude of course butdo you think you are wise
ever since you have come here there have been hostile demonstrations against you and your family
im not a croaker buttake a warning
leave before anything occurs that will cause you a lifelong regret  i am willing to take the responsibility i said coldly
i think he gave me up then as a poor proposition
he asked to be shown where arnold armstrongs body had been found and i took him there
he scrutinized the whole place carefully examining the stairs and the lock
when he had taken a formal farewell i was confident of one thing
doctor walker would do anything he could to get me away from sunnyside
fourteen elm street   it was monday evening when we found the body of poor old thomas
monday night had been uneventful things were quiet at the house and the peculiar circumstances of the old mans death had been carefully kept from the servants
rosie took charge of the diningroom and pantry in the absence of a butler and except for the warning of the casanova doctor everything breathed of peace
affairs at the traders bank were progressing slowly
the failure had hit small stockholders very hard the minister of the little methodist chapel in casanova among them
he had received as a legacy from an uncle a few shares of stock in the traders bank and now his joy was turned to bitterness he had to sacrifice everything he had in the world and his feeling against paul armstrong dead as he was must have been bitter in the extreme
he was asked to officiate at the simple services when the dead bankers body was interred in casanova churchyard but the good man providentially took cold and a substitute was called in
a few days after the services he called to see me a kindfaced little man in a very bad frockcoat and laundered tie
i think he was uncertain as to my connection with the armstrong family and dubious whether i considered mr armstrongs taking away a matter for condolence or congratulation
he was not long in doubt
i liked the little man
he had known thomas well and had promised to officiate at the services in the rickety african zion church
he told me more of himself than he knew and before he left i astonished himand myself i admitby promising a new carpet for his church
he was much affected and i gathered that he had yearned over his ragged chapel as a mother over a halfclothed child
you are laying up treasure miss innes he said brokenly where neither moth nor rust corrupt nor thieves break through and steal  it is certainly a safer place than sunnyside i admitted
and the thought of the carpet permitted him to smile
he stood just inside the doorway looking from the luxury of the house to the beauty of the view
the rich ought to be good he said wistfully
they have so much that is beautiful and beauty is ennobling
and yetwhile i ought to say nothing but good of the deadmr
armstrong saw nothing of this fair prospect
to him these trees and lawns were not the work of god
they were property at so much an acre
he loved money miss innes
he offered up everything to his golden calf
not power not ambition was his fetish it was money then he dropped his pulpit manner and turning to me with his engaging smile in spite of all this luxury he said the country people here have a saying that mr paul armstrong could sit on a dollar and see all around it
unlike the summer people he gave neither to the poor nor to the church
he loved money for its own sake  and there are no pockets in shrouds i said cynically
i sent him home in the car with a bunch of hothouse roses for his wife and he was quite overwhelmed
as for me i had a generous glow that was cheap at the price of a church carpet
i received less gratificationand less gratitudewhen i presented the new silver communion set to st barnabas
i had a great many things to think about in those days
i made out a list of questions and possible answers but i seemed only to be working around in a circle
i always ended where i began
the list was something like this  who had entered the house the night before the murder
thomas claimed it was mr bailey whom he had seen on the footpath and who owned the pearl cufflink
why did arnold armstrong come back after he had left the house the night he was killed
no answer
was it on the mission louise had mentioned
who admitted him
gertrude said she had locked the east entry
there was no key on the dead man or in the door
he must have been admitted from within
who had been locked in the clothes chute
some one unfamiliar with the house evidently
only two people missing from the household rosie and gertrude
rosie had been at the lodge
thereforebut was it gertrude
might it not have been the mysterious intruder again
who had accosted rosie on the drive
againperhaps the nightly visitor
it seemed more likely some one who suspected a secret at the lodge
was louise under surveillance
who had passed louise on the circular staircase
could it have been thomas
the key to the east entry made this a possibility
but why was he there if it were indeed he
who had made the hole in the trunkroom wall
it was not vandalism
it had been done quietly and with deliberate purpose
if i had only known how to read the purpose of that gaping aperture what i might have saved in anxiety and mental strain
why had louise left her people and come home to hide at the lodge
there was no answer as yet to this or to the next questions
why did both she and doctor walker warn us away from the house
who was lucien wallace
what did thomas see in the shadows the night he died
what was the meaning of the subtle change in gertrude
was jack bailey an accomplice or a victim in the looting of the traders bank
what allpowerful reason made louise determine to marry doctor walker
the examiners were still working on the books of the traders bank and it was probable that several weeks would elapse before everything was cleared up
the firm of expert accountants who had examined the books some two months before testified that every bond every piece of valuable paper was there at that time
it had been shortly after their examination that the president who had been in bad health had gone to california
mr bailey was still ill at the knickerbocker and in this as in other ways gertrudes conduct puzzled me
she seemed indifferent refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank and never to my knowledge either wrote to him or went to see him
gradually i came to the conclusion that gertrude with the rest of the world believed her lover guilty andalthough i believed it myself for that matteri was irritated by her indifference
girls in my day did not meekly accept the publics verdict as to the man they loved
but presently something occurred that made me think that under gertrudes surface calm there was a seething flood of emotions
tuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds but he found nothing
in the afternoon he disappeared and it was late that night when he came home
he said he would have to go back to the city the following day and arranged with halsey and alex to guard the house
liddy came to me on wednesday morning with her black silk apron held up like a bag and her eyes big with virtuous wrath
it was the day of thomas funeral in the village and alex and i were in the conservatory cutting flowers for the old mans casket
liddy is never so happy as when she is making herself wretched and now her mouth drooped while her eyes were triumphant
i always said there were plenty of things going on here right under our noses that we couldnt see she said holding out her apron
i dont see with my nose i remarked
what have you got there  liddy pushed aside a halfdozen geranium pots and in the space thus cleared she dumped the contents of her aprona handful of tiny bits of paper
alex had stepped back but i saw him watching her curiously
wait a moment liddy i said
you have been going through the library paperbasket again  liddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long practice and paid no attention
did it ever occur to you i went on putting my hand over the scraps that when people tear up their correspondence it is for the express purpose of keeping it from being read  if they wasnt ashamed of it they wouldnt take so much trouble miss rachel liddy said oracularly
more than that with things happening every day i consider it my duty
if you dont read and act on this i shall give it to that jamieson and ill venture hell not go back to the city today  that decided me
if the scraps had anything to do with the mystery ordinary conventions had no value
so liddy arranged the scraps like working out one of the puzzlepictures children play with and she did it with much the same eagerness
when it was finished she stepped aside while i read it
wednesday night nine oclock
bridge i real aloud
then aware of alexs stare i turned on liddy
some one is to play bridge tonight at nine oclock i said
is that your business or mine  liddy was aggrieved
she was about to reply when i scooped up the pieces and left the conservatory
now then i said when we got outside will you tell me why you choose to take alex into your confidence
hes no fool
do you suppose he thinks any one in this house is going to play bridge tonight at nine oclock by appointment
i suppose you have shown it in the kitchen and instead of my being able to slip down to the bridge tonight quietly and see who is there the whole household will be going in a procession  nobody knows it liddy said humbly
i found it in the basket in miss gertrudes dressingroom
look at the back of the sheet i turned over some of the scraps and sure enough it was a blank deposit slip from the traders bank
so gertrude was going to meet jack bailey that night by the bridge
and i had thought he was ill
it hardly seemed like the action of an innocent manthis avoidance of daylight and of his fiances people
i decided to make certain however by going to the bridge that night
after luncheon mr jamieson suggested that i go with him to richfield and i consented
i am inclined to place more faith in doctor stewarts story he said since i found that scrap in old thomas pocket
it bears out the statement that the woman with the child and the woman who quarreled with armstrong are the same
it looks as if thomas had stumbled on to some affair which was more or less discreditable to the dead man and with a certain loyalty to the family had kept it to himself
then you see your story about the woman at the cardroom window begins to mean something
it is the nearest approach to anything tangible that we have had yet  warner took us to richfield in the car
it was about twentyfive miles by railroad but by taking a series of atrociously rough short cuts we got there very quickly
it was a pretty little town on the river and back on the hill i could see the mortons big country house where halsey and gertrude had been staying until the night of the murder
elm street was almost the only street and number fourteen was easily found
it was a small white house dilapidated without having gained anything picturesque with a low window and a porch only a foot or so above the bit of a lawn
there was a babycarriage in the path and from a swing at the side came the sound of conflict
three small children were disputing vociferously and a faded young woman with a kindly face was trying to hush the clamor
when she saw us she untied her gingham apron and came around to the porch
good afternoon i said
jamieson lifted his hat without speaking
i came to inquire about a child named lucien wallace  i am glad you have come she said
in spite of the other children i think the little fellow is lonely
we thought perhaps his mother would be here today  mr jamieson stepped forward
you are mrs tate i wondered how the detective knew
yes sir  mrs
tate we want to make some inquiries
perhaps in the house  come right in she said hospitably
and soon we were in the little shabby parlor exactly like a thousand of its prototypes
mrs tate sat uneasily her hands folded in her lap
how long has lucien been here mr jamieson asked
since a week ago last friday
his mother paid one weeks board in advance the other has not been paid  was he ill when he came  no sir not what youd call sick
he was getting better of typhoid she said and hes picking up fine  will you tell me his mothers name and address  thats the trouble the young woman said knitting her brows
she gave her name as mrs wallace and said she had no address
she was looking for a boardinghouse in town
she said she worked in a department store and couldnt take care of the child properly and he needed fresh air and milk
i had three children of my own and one more didnt make much difference in the work buti wish she would pay this weeks board  did she say what store it was  no sir but all the boys clothes came from kings
he has far too fine clothes for the country  there was a chorus of shouts and shrill yells from the front door followed by the loud stamping of childrens feet and a throaty whoa whoa into the room came a tandem team of two chubby youngsters a boy and a girl harnessed with a clothesline and driven by a laughing boy of about seven in tan overalls and brass buttons
the small driver caught my attention at once he was a beautiful child and although he showed traces of recent severe illness his skin had now the clear transparency of health
whoa flinders he shouted
youre goin to smash the trap  mr jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a leadpencil striped blue and yellow
now then he said when the boy had taken the leadpencil and was testing its usefulness on the detectives cuff now then ill bet you dont know what your name is  i do said the boy
lucien wallace  great
and whats your mothers name  mother of course
whats your mothers name and he pointed to me
i am going to stop wearing black it doubles a womans age
and where did you live before you came here the detective was polite enough not to smile
grossmutter he said
and i saw mr jamiesons eyebrows go up
german he commented
well young man you dont seem to know much about yourself  ive tried it all week mrs tate broke in
the boy knows a word or two of german but he doesnt know where he lived or anything about himself  mr jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her
mrs
tate he said i want you to do something
here is some money for the telephone call
the instant the boys mother appears here call up that number and ask for the person whose name is there
you can run across to the drugstore on an errand and do it quietly
just say the lady has come  the lady has come repeated mrs tate
very well sir and i hope it will be soon
the milkbill alone is almost double what it was  how much is the childs board i asked
three dollars a week including his washing  very well i said
now mrs tate i am going to pay last weeks board and a week in advance
if the mother comes she is to know nothing of this visitabsolutely not a word and in return for your silence you may use this money forsomething for your own children  her tired faded face lighted up and i saw her glance at the little tates small feet
shoes i divinedthe feet of the genteel poor being almost as expensive as their stomachs
as we went back mr jamieson made only one remark i think he was laboring under the weight of a great disappointment
is kings a childrens outfitting place he asked
not especially
it is a general department store  he was silent after that but he went to the telephone as soon as we got home and called up king and company in the city
after a time he got the general manager and they talked for some time
when mr jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to me
the plot thickens he said with his ready smile
there are four women named wallace at kings none of them married and none over twenty
i think i shall go up to the city tonight
i want to go to the childrens hospital
but before i go miss innes i wish you would be more frank with me than you have been yet
i want you to show me the revolver you picked up in the tulip bed  so he had known all along
it was a revolver mr jamieson i admitted cornered at last but i can not show it to you
it is not in my possession     a ladder out of place   at dinner mr jamieson suggested sending a man out in his place for a couple of days but halsey was certain there would be nothing more and felt that he and alex could manage the situation
the detective went back to town early in the evening and by nine oclock halsey who had been playing golfas a man does anything to take his mind away from troublewas sleeping soundly on the big leather davenport in the livingroom
i sat and knitted pretending not to notice when gertrude got up and wandered out into the starlight
as soon as i was satisfied that she had gone however i went out cautiously
i had no intention of eavesdropping but i wanted to be certain that it was jack bailey she was meeting
too many things had occurred in which gertrude was or appeared to be involved to allow anything to be left in question
i went slowly across the lawn skirted the hedge to a break not far from the lodge and found myself on the open road
perhaps a hundred feet to the left the path led across the valley to the country club and only a little way off was the footbridge over casanova creek
but just as i was about to turn down the path i heard steps coming toward me and i shrank into the bushes
it was gertrude going back quickly toward the house
i was surprised
i waited until she had had time to get almost to the house before i started
and then i stepped back again into the shadows
the reason why gertrude had not kept her tryst was evident
leaning on the parapet of the bridge in the moonlight and smoking a pipe was alex the gardener
i could have throttled liddy for her carelessness in reading the torn note where he could hear
and i could cheerfully have choked alex to death for his audacity
but there was no help for it i turned and followed gertrude slowly back to the house
the frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented any relaxation after dusk
we had redoubled our vigilance as to bolts and windowlocks but as mr jamieson had suggested we allowed the door at the east entry to remain as before locked by the yale lock only
to provide only one possible entrance for the invader and to keep a constant guard in the dark at the foot of the circular staircase seemed to be the only method
in the absence of the detective alex and halsey arranged to change off halsey to be on duty from ten to two and alex from two until six
each man was armed and as an additional precaution the one off duty slept in a room near the head of the circular staircase and kept his door open to be ready for emergency
these arrangements were carefully kept from the servants who were only commencing to sleep at night and who retired one and all with barred doors and lamps that burned full until morning
the house was quiet again wednesday night
it was almost a week since louise had encountered some one on the stairs and it was four days since the discovery of the hole in the trunkroom wall
arnold armstrong and his father rested side by side in the casanova churchyard and at the zion african church on the hill a new mound marked the last restingplace of poor thomas
louise was with her mother in town and beyond a polite note of thanks to me we had heard nothing from her
doctor walker had taken up his practice again and we saw him now and then flying past along the road always at top speed
the murder of arnold armstrong was still unavenged and i remained firm in the position i had takento stay at sunnyside until the thing was at least partly cleared
and yet for all its quiet it was on wednesday night that perhaps the boldest attempt was made to enter the house
on thursday afternoon the laundress sent word she would like to speak to me and i saw her in my private sittingroom a small room beyond the dressingroom
mary anne was embarrassed
she had rolled down her sleeves and tied a white apron around her waist and she stood making folds in it with fingers that were red and shiny from her soapsuds
well mary i said encouragingly whats the matter
dont dare to tell me the soap is out  no mam miss innes she had a nervous habit of looking first at my one eye and then at the other her own optics shifting ceaselessly right eye left eye right eye until i found myself doing the same thing
no mam
i was askin did you want the ladder left up the clothes chute  the what i screeched and was sorry the next minute
seeing her suspicions were verified mary anne had gone white and stood with her eyes shifting more wildly than ever
theres a ladder up the clothes chute miss innes she said
its up that tight i cant move it and i didnt like to ask for help until i spoke to you  it was useless to dissemble mary anne knew now as well as i did that the ladder had no business to be there
i did the best i could however
i put her on the defensive at once
then you didnt lock the laundry last night  i locked it tight and put the key in the kitchen on its nail  very well then you forgot a window  mary anne hesitated
yesm she said at last
i thought i locked them all but there was one open this morning  i went out of the room and down the hall followed by mary anne
the door into the clothes chute was securely bolted and when i opened it i saw the evidence of the womans story
a pruningladder had been brought from where it had lain against the stable and now stood upright in the clothes shaft its end resting against the wall between the first and second floors
i turned to mary
this is due to your carelessness i said
if we had all been murdered in our beds it would have been your fault she shivered
now not a word of this through the house and send alex to me  the effect on alex was to make him apoplectic with rage and with it all i fancied there was an element of satisfaction
as i look back so many things are plain to me that i wonder i could not see at the time
it is all known now and yet the whole thing was so remarkable that perhaps my stupidity was excusable
alex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully
it is caught he said with a grim smile
the fools to have left a warning like that
the only trouble is miss innes they wont be apt to come back for a while  i shouldnt regard that in the light of a calamity i replied
until late that evening halsey and alex worked at the chute
they forced down the ladder at last and put a new bolt on the door
as for myself i sat and wondered if i had a deadly enemy intent on my destruction
i was growing more and more nervous
liddy had given up all pretense at bravery and slept regularly in my dressingroom on the couch with a prayerbook and a game knife from the kitchen under her pillow thus preparing for both the natural and the supernatural
that was the way things stood that thursday night when i myself took a hand in the struggle
while the stables burned   about nine oclock that night liddy came into the livingroom and reported that one of the housemaids declared she had seen two men slip around the corner of the stable
gertrude had been sitting staring in front of her jumping at every sound
now she turned on liddy pettishly
i declare liddy she said you are a bundle of nerves
what if eliza did see some men around the stable
it may have been warner and alex  warner is in the kitchen miss liddy said with dignity
and if you had come through what i have you would be a bundle of nerves too
miss rachel id be thankful if youd give me my months wages tomorrow
ill be going to my sisters  very well i said to her evident amazement
i will make out the check
warner can take you down to the noon train  liddys face was really funny
youll have a nice time at your sisters i went on
five children hasnt she  thats it liddy said suddenly bursting into tears
send me away after all these years and your new shawl only half done and nobody knowin how to fix the water for your bath  its time i learned to prepare my own bath i was knitting complacently
but gertrude got up and put her arms around liddys shaking shoulders
you are two big babies she said soothingly
neither one of you could get along for an hour without the other
so stop quarreling and be good
liddy go right up and lay out auntys night things
she is going to bed early  after liddy had gone i began to think about the men at the stable and i grew more and more anxious
halsey was aimlessly knocking the billiardballs around in the billiardroom and i called to him
halsey i said when he sauntered in is there a policeman in casanova  constable he said laconically
veteran of the war one arm in office to conciliate the g a r element
why  because i am uneasy tonight and i told him what liddy had said
is there any one you can think of who could be relied on to watch the outside of the house tonight  we might get sam bohannon from the club he said thoughtfully
it wouldnt be a bad scheme
hes a smart darky and with his mouth shut and his shirtfront covered you couldnt see him a yard off in the dark  halsey conferred with alex and the result in an hour was sam
his instructions were simple
there had been numerous attempts to break into the house it was the intention not to drive intruders away but to capture them
if sam saw anything suspicious outside he was to tap at the east entry where alex and halsey were to alternate in keeping watch through the night
it was with a comfortable feeling of security that i went to bed that night
the door between gertrudes rooms and mine had been opened and with the doors into the hall bolted we were safe enough
although liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no obstacles to our disturbers
as before halsey watched the east entry from ten until two
he had an eye to comfort and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair very large and deep
we went upstairs rather early and through the open door gertrude and i kept up a running fire of conversation
liddy was brushing my hair and gertrude was doing her own with a long free sweep of her strong round arms
did you know mrs armstrong and louise are in the village she called
no i replied startled
how did you hear it  i met the oldest stewart girl today the doctors daughter and she told me they had not gone back to town after the funeral
they went directly to that little yellow house next to doctor walkers and are apparently settled there
they took the house furnished for the summer  why its a bandbox i said
i cant imagine fanny armstrong in such a place  its true nevertheless
ella stewart says mrs armstrong has aged terribly and looks as if she is hardly able to walk  i lay and thought over some of these things until midnight
the electric lights went out then fading slowly until there was only a redhot loop to be seen in the bulb and then even that died away and we were embarked on the darkness of another night
apparently only a few minutes elapsed during which my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness
then i noticed that the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light liddy noticed it at the same time and i heard her jump up
at that moment sams deep voice boomed from somewhere just below
fire he yelled
the stables on fire  i could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive and a moment later halsey joined him
alex was awake and running down the stairs and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered three of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive although excepting a few sparks there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards
gertrude seldom loses her presence of mind and she ran to the telephone
but by the time the casanova volunteer fire department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace with the dragon fly safe but blistered in the road
some gasolene exploded just as the volunteer department got to work which shook their nerves as well as the burning building
the stable being on a hill was a torch to attract the population from every direction
rumor had it that sunnyside was burning and it was amazing how many people threw something over their nightclothes and flew to the conflagration
i take it casanova has few fires and sunnyside was furnishing the people in one way and another the greatest excitement they had had for years
the stable was off the west wing
i hardly know how i came to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot
liddy was putting my clothes into sheets preparatory to tossing them out the window when i found her and i could hardly persuade her to stop
i want you to come with me liddy i said
bring a candle and a couple of blankets  she lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east wing and at the top of the staircase she balked
i am not going down there she said firmly
there is no one guarding the door down there i explained
who knowsthis may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of the house and let some one in here  the instant i had said it i was convinced i had hit on the explanation and that perhaps it was already too late
it seemed to me as i listened that i heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch but there was so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell
liddy was on the point of retreat
very well i said then i shall go down alone
run back to mr halseys room and get his revolver
dont shoot down the stairs if you hear a noise rememberi shall be down there
and hurry  i put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off my bedroom slippers
then i crept down the stairs going very slowly and listening with all my ears
i was keyed to such a pitch that i felt no fear like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before execution i was no longer able to suffer apprehension
i was past that
just at the foot of the stairs i stubbed my toe against halseys big chair and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the pain subsided to a dull ache
and theni knew i was right
some one had put a key into the lock and was turning it
for some reason it refused to work and the key was withdrawn
there was a muttering of voices outside i had only a second
another trial and the door would open
the candle above made a faint gleam down the welllike staircase and at that moment with a second no more to spare i thought of a plan
the heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and the door
with a crash i had turned it on its side wedging it against the door its legs against the stairs
i could hear a faint scream from liddy at the crash and then she came down the stairs on a run with the revolver held straight out in front of her
thank god she said in a shaking voice
i thought it was you  i pointed to the door and she understood
call out the windows at the other end of the house i whispered
run
tell them not to wait for anything  she went up the stairs at that two at a time
evidently she collided with the candle for it went out and i was left in darkness
i was really astonishingly cool
i remember stepping over the chair and gluing my ear to the door and i shall never forget feeling it give an inch or two there in the darkness under a steady pressure from without
but the chair held although i could hear an ominous cracking of one of the legs
and then without the slightest warning the cardroom window broke with a crash
i had my finger on the trigger of the revolver and as i jumped it went off right through the door
some one outside swore roundly and for the first time i could hear what was said
only a scratch    men are at the other end of the house    have the whole rats nest on us and a lot of profanity which i wont write down
the voices were at the broken window now and although i was trembling violently i was determined that i would hold them until help came
i moved up the stairs until i could see into the cardroom or rather through it to the window
as i looked a small man put his leg over the sill and stepped into the room
the curtain confused him for a moment then he turned not toward me but toward the billiardroom door
i fired again and something that was glass or china crashed to the ground
then i ran up the stairs and along the corridor to the main staircase
gertrude was standing there trying to locate the shots and i must have been a peculiar figure with my hair in crimps my dressinggown flying no slippers and a revolver clutched in my hands i had no time to talk
there was the sound of footsteps in the lower hall and some one bounded up the stairs
i had gone berserk i think
i leaned over the stairrail and fired again
halsey below yelled at me
what are you doing up there he yelled
you missed me by an inch  and then i collapsed and fainted
when i came around liddy was rubbing my temples with eau de quinine and the search was in full blast
well the man was gone
the stable burned to the ground while the crowd cheered at every falling rafter and the volunteer fire department sprayed it with a garden hose
and in the house alex and halsey searched every corner of the lower floor finding no one
the truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned chair
that the unknown had got upstairs was almost impossible
he had not used the main staircase there was no way to the upper floor in the east wing and liddy had been at the window in the west wing where the servants stair went up
but we did not go to bed at all
sam bohannon and warner helped in the search and not a closet escaped scrutiny
even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling without result
the door in the east entry had a hole through it where my bullet had gone
the hole slanted downward and the bullet was embedded in the porch
some reddish stains showed it had done execution
somebody will walk lame halsey said when he had marked the course of the bullet
its too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot  from that time on i watched every person i met for a limp and to this day the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me
but casanova had no lame men the nearest approach to it was an old fellow who tended the safety gates at the railroad and he i learned on inquiry had two artificial legs
our man had gone and the large and expensive stable at sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred boards
warner swore the fire was incendiary and in view of the attempt to enter the house there seemed to be no doubt of it
flinders   if halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence through the whole affair it would have been much simpler
if he had been altogether frank about jack bailey and if the day after the fire he had told me what he suspected there would have been no harrowing period for all of us with the boy in danger
but young people refuse to profit by the experience of their elders and sometimes the elders are the ones to suffer
i was much used up the day after the fire and gertrude insisted on my going out
the machine was temporarily out of commission and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer
gertrude finally got a trap from the casanova liveryman and we went out
just as we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman
she had put down a small valise and stood inspecting the house and grounds minutely
i should hardly have noticed her had it not been for the fact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox
ugh gertrude said when we had passed what a face
i shall dream of it tonight
get up flinders  flinders i asked
is that the horses name  it is she flicked the horses stubby mane with the whip
he didnt look like a livery horse and the liveryman said he had bought him from the armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut down the stable
nice flindersgood old boy  flinders was certainly not a common name for a horse and yet the youngster at richfield had named his prancing curlyhaired little horse flinders
it set me to thinking
at my request halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent from whom we had secured the house
also he had called mr jamieson by telephone and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous nights events
mr jamieson promised to come out that night and to bring another man with him
i did not consider it necessary to notify mrs armstrong in the village
no doubt she knew of the fire and in view of my refusal to give up the house an interview would probably have been unpleasant enough
but as we passed doctor walkers white and green house i thought of something
stop here gertrude i said
i am going to get out  to see louise she asked
no i want to ask this young walker something  she was curious i knew but i did not wait to explain
i went up the walk to the house where a brass sign at the side announced the office and went in
the receptionroom was empty but from the consultingroom beyond came the sound of two voices not very amicable
it is an outrageous figure some one was storming
then the doctors quiet tone evidently not arguing merely stating something
but i had not time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill so i coughed
the voices ceased at once a door closed somewhere and the doctor entered from the hall of the house
he looked sufficiently surprised at seeing me
good afternoon doctor i said formally
i shall not keep you from your patient
i wish merely to ask you a question  wont you sit down  it will not be necessary
doctor has any one come to you either early this morning or today to have you treat a bullet wound  nothing so startling has happened to me he said
a bullet wound
things must be lively at sunnyside  i didnt say it was at sunnyside
but as it happens it was
if any such case comes to you will it be too much trouble for you to let me know  i shall be only too happy he said
i understand you have had a fire up there too
a fire and shooting in one night is rather lively for a quiet place like that  it is as quiet as a boilershop i replied as i turned to go
and you are still going to stay  until i am burned out i responded
and then on my way down the steps i turned around suddenly
doctor i asked at a venture have you ever heard of a child named lucien wallace  clever as he was his face changed and stiffened
he was on his guard again in a moment
lucien wallace he repeated
no i think not
there are plenty of wallaces around but i dont know any lucien  i was as certain as possible that he did
people do not lie readily to me and this man lied beyond a doubt
but there was nothing to be gained now his defenses were up and i left half irritated and wholly baffled
our reception was entirely different at doctor stewarts
taken into the bosom of the family at once flinders tied outside and nibbling the grass at the roadside gertrude and i drank some homemade elderberry wine and told briefly of the fire
of the more serious part of the nights experience of course we said nothing
but when at last we had left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our steed i asked him the same question i had put to doctor walker
shot he said
bless my soul no
why what have you been doing up at the big house miss innes  some one tried to enter the house during the fire and was shot and slightly injured i said hastily
please dont mention it we wish to make as little of it as possible  there was one other possibility and we tried that
at casanova station i saw the station master and asked him if any trains left casanova between one oclock and daylight
there was none until six am
the next question required more diplomacy
did you notice on the sixoclock train any personany manwho limped a little i asked
please try to remember we are trying to trace a man who was seen loitering around sunnyside last night before the fire  he was all attention in a moment
i was up there myself at the fire he said volubly
im a member of the volunteer company
first big fire weve had since the summer house burned over to the club golf links
my wife was sayin the other day dave you might as well a saved the money in that there helmet and shirt and here last night they came in handy
rang that bell so hard i hadnt time scarcely to get em on  anddid you see a man who limped gertrude put in as he stopped for breath
not at the train mam he said
no such person got on here today
but ill tell you where i did see a man that limped
i didnt wait till the fire company left theres a fast freight goes through at four fortyfive and i had to get down to the station
i seen there wasnt much more to do anyhow at the firewed got the flames under controlgertrude looked at me and smiledso i started down the hill
there was folks here and there goin home and along by the path to the country club i seen two men
one was a short fellow
he was sitting on a big rock his back to me and he had something white in his hand as if he was tying up his foot
after id gone on a piece i looked back and he was hobbling on andexcuse me misshe was swearing something sickening  did they go toward the club gertrude asked suddenly leaning forward
no miss
i think they came into the village
i didnt get a look at their faces but i know every chick and child in the place and everybody knows me
when they didnt shout at mein my uniform you knowi took it they were strangers  so all we had for our afternoons work was this some one had been shot by the bullet that went through the door he had not left the village and he had not called in a physician
also doctor walker knew who lucien wallace was and his very denial made me confident that in that one direction at least we were on the right track
the thought that the detective would be there that night was the most cheering thing of all and i think even gertrude was glad of it
driving home that afternoon i saw her in the clear sunlight for the first time in several days and i was startled to see how ill she looked
she was thin and colorless and all her bright animation was gone
gertrude i said i have been a very selfish old woman
you are going to leave this miserable house tonight
annie morton is going to scotland next week and you shall go right with her  to my surprise she flushed painfully
i dont want to go aunt ray she said
dont make me leave now  you are losing your health and your good looks i said decidedly
you should have a change  i shant stir a foot she was equally decided
then more lightly why you and liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the week  perhaps i was growing suspicious of every one but it seemed to me that gertrudes gaiety was forced and artificial
i watched her covertly during the rest of the drive and i did not like the two spots of crimson in her pale cheeks
but i said nothing more about sending her to scotland i knew she would not go
a visit from louise   that day was destined to be an eventful one for when i entered the house and found eliza ensconced in the upper hall on a chair with mary anne doing her best to stifle her with household ammonia and liddy rubbing her wristswhatever good that is supposed to doi knew that the ghost had been walking again and this time in daylight
eliza was in a frenzy of fear
she clutched at my sleeve when i went close to her and refused to let go until she had told her story
coming just after the fire the household was demoralized and it was no surprise to me to find alex and the undergardener struggling downstairs with a heavy trunk between them
i didnt want to do it miss innes alex said
but she was so excited i was afraid she would do as she saiddrag it down herself and scratch the staircase  i was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet at the same time
now eliza when you have washed your face and stopped bawling i said come into my sittingroom and tell me what has happened  liddy put away my things without speaking
the very set of her shoulders expressed disapproval
well i said when the silence became uncomfortable things seem to be warming up  silence from liddy and a long sigh
if eliza goes i dont know where to look for another cook more silence
rosie is probably a good cook sniff
liddy i said at last dont dare to deny that you are having the time of your life
you positively gloat in this excitement
you never looked better
its my opinion all this running around and getting jolted out of a rut has stirred up that torpid liver of yours  its not myself im thinking about she said goaded into speech
maybe my liver was torpid and maybe it wasnt but i know this ive got some feelings left and to see you standing at the foot of that staircase shootin through the doorill never be the same woman again  well im glad of thatanything for a change i said
and in came eliza flanked by rosie and mary anne
her story broken with sobs and corrections from the other two was this at two oclock twofifteen rosie insisted she had gone upstairs to get a picture from her room to show mary anne
a picture of a lady mary anne interposed
she went up the servants staircase and along the corridor to her room which lay between the trunkroom and the unfinished ballroom
she heard a sound as she went down the corridor like some one moving furniture but she was not nervous
she thought it might be men examining the house after the fire the night before but she looked in the trunkroom and saw nobody
she went into her room quietly
the noise had ceased and everything was quiet
then she sat down on the side of her bed and feeling faintshe was subject to spellsi told you that when i came didnt i rosie yesm indeed she didshe put her head down on her pillow and  took a nap
all right i said
go on  when i came to miss innes sure as im sittin here i thought id die
somethin hit me on the face and i set up sudden
and then i seen the plaster drop droppin from a little hole in the wall
and the first thing i knew an iron bar that long fully two yards by her measure shot through that hole and tumbled on the bed
if id been still sleeping fainting corrected rosie id a been hit on the head and killed  i wisht youd heard her scream put in mary anne
and her face as white as a pillowslip when she tumbled down the stairs  no doubt there is some natural explanation for it eliza i said
you may have dreamed it in your fainting attack
but if it is true the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show it  eliza looked a little bit sheepish
the holes there all right miss innes she said
but the bar was gone when mary anne and rosie went up to pack my trunk  that wasnt all liddys voice came funereally from a corner
eliza said that from the hole in the wall a burning eye looked down at her  the wall must be at least six inches thick i said with asperity
unless the person who drilled the hole carried his eyes on the ends of a stick eliza couldnt possibly have seen them  but the fact remained and a visit to elizas room proved it
i might jeer all i wished some one had drilled a hole in the unfinished wall of the ballroom passing between the bricks of the partition and shooting through the unresisting plaster of elizas room with such force as to send the rod flying on to her bed
i had gone upstairs alone and i confess the thing puzzled me in two or three places in the wall small apertures had been made none of them of any depth
not the least mysterious thing was the disappearance of the iron implement that had been used
i remembered a story i read once about an impish dwarf that lived in the spaces between the double walls of an ancient castle
i wondered vaguely if my original idea of a secret entrance to a hidden chamber could be right after all and if we were housing some erratic guest who played pranks on us in the dark and destroyed the walls that he might listen hidden safely away to our amazed investigations
mary anne and eliza left that afternoon but rosie decided to stay
it was about five oclock when the hack came from the station to get them and to my amazement it had an occupant
matthew geist the driver asked for me and explained his errand with pride
ive brought you a cook miss innes he said
when the message came to come up for two girls and their trunks i supposed there was something doing and as this here woman had been looking for work in the village i thought id bring her along  already i had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take servants on faith i no longer demanded written and unimpeachable references
i rachel innes have learned not to mind if the cook sits down comfortably in my sittingroom when she is taking the orders for the day and i am grateful if the silver is not cleaned with scouring soap
and so that day i merely told liddy to send the new applicant in
when she came however i could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise
it was the woman with the pitted face
she stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door and she had an air of selfconfidence that was inspiring
yes she could cook was not a fancy cook but could make good soups and desserts if there was any one to take charge of the salads
and so in the end i took her
as halsey said when we told him it didnt matter much about the cooks face if it was clean
i have spoken of halseys restlessness
on that day it seemed to be more than ever a resistless impulse that kept him out until after luncheon
i think he hoped constantly that he might meet louise driving over the hills in her runabout possibly he did meet her occasionally but from his continued gloom i felt sure the situation between them was unchanged
part of the afternoon i believe he readgertrude and i were out as i have said and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to distract him
he was disagreeable which is unlike him nervous looking at his watch every few minutes and he ate almost nothing
he asked twice during the meal on what train mr jamieson and the other detective were coming and had long periods of abstraction during which he dug his fork into my damask cloth and did not hear when he was spoken to
he refused dessert and left the table early excusing himself on the ground that he wanted to see alex
alex however was not to be found
it was after eight when halsey ordered the car and started down the hill at a pace that even for him was unusually reckless
shortly after alex reported that he was ready to go over the house preparatory to closing it for the night
sam bohannon came at a quarter before nine and began his patrol of the grounds and with the arrival of the two detectives to look forward to i was not especially apprehensive
at halfpast nine i heard the sound of a horse driven furiously up the drive
it came to a stop in front of the house and immediately after there were hurried steps on the veranda
our nerves were not what they should have been and gertrude always apprehensive lately was at the door almost instantly
a moment later louise had burst into the room and stood there bareheaded and breathing hard
where is halsey she demanded
above her plain black gown her eyes looked big and somber and the rapid drive had brought no color to her face
i got up and drew forward a chair
he has not come back i said quietly
sit down child you are not strong enough for this kind of thing  i dont think she even heard me
he has not come back she asked looking from me to gertrude
do you know where he went
where can i find him  for heavens sake louise gertrude burst out tell us what is wrong
halsey is not here
he has gone to the station for mr jamieson
what has happened  to the station gertrude
you are sure  yes i said
listen
there is the whistle of the train now  she relaxed a little at our matteroffact tone and allowed herself to sink into a chair
perhaps i was wrong she said heavily
hewill be here in a few moments ifeverything is right  we sat there the three of us without attempt at conversation
both gertrude and i recognized the futility of asking louise any questions her reticence was a part of a role she had assumed
our ears were strained for the first throb of the motor as it turned into the drive and commenced the climb to the house
ten minutes passed fifteen twenty
i saw louises hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of her chair
i watched gertrudes bright color slowly ebbing away and around my own heart i seemed to feel the grasp of a giant hand
twentyfive minutes and then a sound
but it was not the chug of the motor it was the unmistakable rumble of the casanova hack
gertrude drew aside the curtain and peered into the darkness
its the hack i am sure she said evidently relieved
something has gone wrong with the car and no wonderthe way halsey went down the hill  it seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a stop at the door
louise rose and stood watching her hand to her throat
and then gertrude opened the door admitting mr jamieson and a stocky middleaged man
halsey was not with them
when the door had closed and louise realized that halsey had not come her expression changed
from tense watchfulness to relief and now again to absolute despair her face was an open page
halsey i asked unceremoniously ignoring the stranger
did he not meet you  no mr jamieson looked slightly surprised
i rather expected the car but we got up all right  you didnt see him at all louise demanded breathlessly
mr jamieson knew her at once although he had not seen her before
she had kept to her rooms until the morning she left
no miss armstrong he said
i saw nothing of him
what is wrong  then we shall have to find him she asserted
every instant is precious
mr jamieson i have reason for believing that he is in danger but i dont know what it is
onlyhe must be found  the stocky man had said nothing
now however he went quickly toward the door
ill catch the hack down the road and hold it he said
is the gentleman down in the town  mr
jamieson louise said impulsively i can use the hack
take my horse and trap outside and drive like mad
try to find the dragon flyit ought to be easy to trace
i can think of no other way
only dont lose a moment  the new detective had gone and a moment later jamieson went rapidly down the drive the cobs feet striking fire at every step
louise stood looking after them
when she turned around she faced gertrude who stood indignant almost tragic in the hall
you know what threatens halsey louise she said accusingly
i believe you know this whole horrible thing this mystery that we are struggling with
if anything happens to halsey i shall never forgive you  louise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them again
he is as dear to me as he is to you she said sadly
i tried to warn him  nonsense i said as briskly as i could
we are making a lot of trouble out of something perhaps very small
halsey was probably latehe is always late
any moment we may hear the car coming up the road  but it did not come
after a halfhour of suspense louise went out quietly and did not come back
i hardly knew she was gone until i heard the station hack moving off
at eleven oclock the telephone rang
it was mr jamieson
i have found the dragon fly miss innes he said
it has collided with a freight car on the siding above the station
no mr innes was not there but we shall probably find him
send warner for the car  but they did not find him
at four oclock the next morning we were still waiting for news while alex watched the house and sam the grounds
at daylight i dropped into exhausted sleep
halsey had not come back and there was no word from the detective
halseys disappearance   nothing that had gone before had been as bad as this
the murder and thomas sudden death we had been able to view in a detached sort of way
but with halseys disappearance everything was altered
our little circle intact until now was broken
we were no longer onlookers who saw a battle passing around them
we were the center of action
of course there was no time then to voice such an idea
my mind seemed able to hold only one thought that halsey had been foully dealt with and that every minute lost might be fatal
mr jamieson came back about eight oclock the next morning he was covered with mud and his hat was gone
altogether we were a sadlooking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could eat
over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had learned of halseys movements the night before
up to a certain point the car had made it easy enough to follow him
and i gathered that mr burns the other detective had followed a similar car for miles at dawn only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run
he left here about ten minutes after eight mr jamieson said
he went alone and at eight twenty he stopped at doctor walkers
i went to the doctors about midnight but he had been called out on a case and had not come back at four oclock
from the doctors it seems mr innes walked across the lawn to the cottage mrs armstrong and her daughter have taken
mrs armstrong had retired and he said perhaps a dozen words to miss louise
she will not say what they were but the girl evidently suspects what has occurred
that is she suspects foul play but she doesnt know of what nature
then apparently he started directly for the station
he was going very fastthe flagman at the carol street crossing says he saw the car pass
he knew the siren
along somewhere in the dark stretch between carol street and the depot he evidently swerved suddenlyperhaps some one in the roadand went full into the side of a freight
we found it there last night  he might have been thrown under the train by the force of the shock i said tremulously
gertrude shuddered
we examined every inch of track
there wasno sign  but surelyhe cant begone i cried
arent there traces in the mudanything  there is no mudonly dust
there has been no rain
and the footpath there is of cinders
miss innes i am inclined to think that he has met with bad treatment in the light of what has gone before
i do not think he has been murdered i shrank from the word
burns is back in the country on a clue we got from the night clerk at the drugstore
there will be two more men here by noon and the city office is on the lookout  the creek gertrude asked
the creek is shallow now
if it were swollen with rain it would be different
there is hardly any water in it
now miss innes he said turning to me i must ask you some questions
had mr halsey any possible reason for going away like this without warning  none whatever  he went away once before he persisted
and you were as sure then  he did not leave the dragon fly jammed into the side of a freight car before  no but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop a long distance from here
do you know if he had any enemies
any one who might wish him out of the way  not that i know of unlessno i can not think of any  was he in the habit of carrying money  he never carried it far
no he never had more than enough for current expenses  mr jamieson got up then and began to pace the room
it was an unwonted concession to the occasion
then i think we get at it by elimination
the chances are against flight
if he was hurt we find no trace of him
it looks almost like an abduction
this young doctor walkerhave you any idea why mr innes should have gone there last night  i can not understand it gertrude said thoughtfully
i dont think he knew doctor walker at all andtheir relations could hardly have been cordial under the circumstances  jamieson pricked up his ears and little by little he drew from us the unfortunate story of halseys love affair and the fact that louise was going to marry doctor walker
mr jamieson listened attentively
there are some interesting developments here he said thoughtfully
the woman who claims to be the mother of lucien wallace has not come back
your nephew has apparently been spirited away
there is an organized attempt being made to enter this house in fact it has been entered
witness the incident with the cook yesterday
and i have a new piece of information  he looked carefully away from gertrude
mr
john bailey is not at his knickerbocker apartments and i dont know where he is
its a hash thats what it is
its a chinese puzzle
they wont fit together unlessunless mr bailey and your nephew have again  and once again gertrude surprised me
they are not together she said hotly
iknow where mr bailey is and my brother is not with him  the detective turned and looked at her keenly
miss gertrude he said if you and miss louise would only tell me everything you know and surmise about this business i should be able to do a great many things
i believe i could find your brother and i might be able towell to do some other things but gertrudes glance did not falter
nothing that i know could help you to find halsey she said stubbornly
i know absolutely as little of his disappearance as you do and i can only say this i do not trust doctor walker
i think he hated halsey and he would get rid of him if he could  perhaps you are right
in fact i had some such theory myself
but doctor walker went out late last night to a serious case in summitville and is still there
burns traced him there
we have made guarded inquiry at the greenwood club and through the village
there is absolutely nothing to go on but this
on the embankment above the railroad at the point where we found the machine is a small house
an old woman and a daughter who is very lame live there
they say that they distinctly heard the shock when the dragon fly hit the car and they went to the bottom of their garden and looked over
the automobile was there they could see the lights and they thought someone had been injured
it was very dark but they could make out two figures standing together
the women were curious and leaving the fence they went back and by a roundabout path down to the road
when they got there the car was still standing the headlight broken and the bonnet crushed but there was no one to be seen  the detective went away immediately and to gertrude and me was left the womans part to watch and wait
by luncheon nothing had been found and i was frantic
i went upstairs to halseys room finally from sheer inability to sit across from gertrude any longer and meet her terrorfilled eyes
liddy was in my dressingroom suspiciously redeyed and trying to put a right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for me
i was too much shaken to scold
what name did that woman in the kitchen give she demanded viciously ripping out the offending sleeve
bliss
mattie bliss i replied
bliss
m b
well thats not what she has on he suitcase
it is marked n f c  the new cook and her initials troubled me not at all
i put on my bonnet and sent for what the casanova liveryman called a stylish turnout having once made up my mind to a course of action i am not one to turn back
warner drove me he was plainly disgusted and he steered the livery horse as he would the dragon fly feeling uneasily with his left foot for the clutch and working his right elbow at an imaginary horn every time a dog got in the way
warner had something on his mind and after we had turned into the road he voiced it
miss innes he said
i overheard a part of a conversation yesterday that i didnt understand
it wasnt my business to understand it for that matter
but ive been thinking all day that id better tell you
yesterday afternoon while you and miss gertrude were out driving i had got the car in some sort of shape again after the fire and i went to the library to call mr innes to see it
i went into the livingroom where miss liddy said he was and halfway across to the library i heard him talking to some one
he seemed to be walking up and down and he was in a rage i can tell you  what did he say  the first thing i heard wasexcuse me miss innes but its what he said the damned rascal he said ill see him inwell in hell was what he said in hell first then somebody else spoke up it was a woman
she said i warned them but they thought i would be afraid  a woman
did you wait to see who it was  i wasnt spying miss innes warner said with dignity
but the next thing caught my attention
she said i knew there was something wrong from the start
a man isnt well one day and dead the next without some reason i thought she was speaking of thomas  and you dont know who it was i exclaimed
warner you had the key to this whole occurrence in your hands and did not use it  however there was nothing to be done
i resolved to make inquiry when i got home and in the meantime my present errand absorbed me
this was nothing less than to see louise armstrong and to attempt to drag from her what she knew or suspected of halseys disappearance
but here as in every direction i turned i was baffled
a neat maid answered the bell but she stood squarely in the doorway and it was impossible to preserve ones dignity and pass her
miss armstrong is very ill and unable to see any one she said
i did not believe her
and mrs armstrongis she also ill  she is with miss louise and can not be disturbed  tell her it is miss innes and that it is a matter of the greatest importance  it would be of no use miss innes
my orders are positive  at that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs
past the maids whitestrapped shoulder i could see a familiar thatch of gray hair and in a moment i was face to face with doctor stewart
he was very grave and his customary geniality was tinged with restraint
you are the very woman i want to see he said promptly
send away your trap and let me drive you home
what is this about your nephew  he has disappeared doctor
not only that but there is every evidence that he has been either abducted or i could not finish
the doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in silence
until we had got a little distance he did not speak then he turned and looked at me
now tell me about it he said
he heard me through without speaking
and you think louise knows something he said when i had finished
i dontin fact i am sure of it
the best evidence of it is this she asked me if he had been heard from or if anything had been learned
she wont allow walker in the room and she made me promise to see you and tell you this dont give up the search for him
find him and find him soon
he is living  well i said if she knows that she knows more
she is a very cruel and ungrateful girl  she is a very sick girl he said gravely
neither you nor i can judge her until we know everything
both she and her mother are ghosts of their former selves
under all this these two sudden deaths this bank robbery the invasions at sunnyside and halseys disappearance there is some mystery that mark my words will come out some day
and when it does we shall find louise armstrong a victim  i had not noticed where we were going but now i saw we were beside the railroad and from a knot of men standing beside the track i divined that it was here the car had been found
the siding however was empty
except a few bits of splintered wood on the ground there was no sign of the accident
where is the freight car that was rammed the doctor asked a bystander
it was taken away at daylight when the train was moved  there was nothing to be gained
he pointed out the house on the embankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the crash and seen two figures beside the car
then we drove slowly home
i had the doctor put me down at the gate and i walked to the housepast the lodge where we had found louise and later poor thomas up the drive where i had seen a man watching the lodge and where later rosie had been frightened past the east entrance where so short a time before the most obstinate effort had been made to enter the house and where that night two weeks ago liddy and i had seen the strange woman
not far from the west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables
i felt like a ruin myself as i paused on the broad veranda before i entered the house
two private detectives had arrived in my absence and it was a relief to turn over to them the responsibility of the house and grounds
mr jamieson they said had arranged for more to assist in the search for the missing man and at that time the country was being scoured in all directions
the household staff was again depleted that afternoon
liddy was waiting to tell me that the new cook had gone bag and baggage without waiting to be paid
no one had admitted the visitor whom warner had heard in the library unless possibly the missing cook
again i was working in a circle
who is nina carrington
the four days from saturday to the following tuesday we lived or existed in a state of the most dreadful suspense
we ate only when liddy brought in a tray and then very little
the papers of course had got hold of the story and we were besieged by newspaper men
from all over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that crumbled again to nothing
every morgue within a hundred miles every hospital had been visited without result
mr jamieson personally took charge of the organized search and every evening no matter where he happened to be he called us by long distance telephone
it was the same formula
nothing today
a new clue to work on
better luck tomorrow  and heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to our vigil
the inaction was deadly
liddy cried all day and because she knew i objected to tears sniffled audibly around the corner
for heavens sake smile i snapped at her
and her ghastly attempt at a grin with her swollen nose and red eyes made me hysterical
i laughed and cried together and pretty soon like the two old fools we were we were sitting together weeping into the same handkerchief
things were happening of course all the time but they made little or no impression
the charity hospital called up doctor stewart and reported that mrs watson was in a critical condition
i understood also that legal steps were being taken to terminate my lease at sunnyside
louise was out of danger but very ill and a trained nurse guarded her like a gorgon
there was a rumor in the village brought up by liddy from the butchers that a wedding had already taken place between louise and doctor walker and this roused me for the first time to action
on tuesday then i sent for the car and prepared to go out
as i waited at the portecochere i saw the undergardener an inoffensive grayishhaired man trimming borders near the house
the day detective was watching him sitting on the carriage block
when he saw me he got up
miss innes he said taking of his hat do you know where alex the gardener is  why no
isnt he here i asked
he has been gone since yesterday afternoon
have you employed him long  only a couple of weeks  is he efficient
a capable man  i hardly know i said vaguely
the place looks all right and i know very little about such things
i know much more about boxes of roses than bushes of them  this man pointing to the assistant says alex isnt a gardener
that he doesnt know anything about plants  thats very strange i said thinking hard
why he came to me from the brays who are in europe  exactly the detective smiled
every man who cuts grass isnt a gardener miss innes and just now it is our policy to believe every person around here a rascal until he proves to be the other thing  warner came up with the car then and the conversation stopped
as he helped me in however the detective said something further
not a word or sign to alex if he comes back he said cautiously
i went first to doctor walkers
i was tired of beating about the bush and i felt that the key to halseys disappearance was here at casanova in spite of mr jamiesons theories
the doctor was in
he came at once to the door of his consultingroom and there was no mask of cordiality in his manner
please come in he said curtly
i shall stay here i think doctor i did not like his face or his manner there was a subtle change in both
he had thrown off the air of friendliness and i thought too that he looked anxious and haggard
doctor walker i said i have come to you to ask some questions
i hope you will answer them
as you know my nephew has not yet been found  so i understand stiffly
i believe if you would you could help us and that leads to one of my questions
will you tell me what was the nature of the conversation you held with him the night he was attacked and carried off  attacked
carried off he said with pretended surprise
really miss innes dont you think you exaggerate
i understand it is not the first time mr innes hasdisappeared  you are quibbling doctor
this is a matter of life and death
will you answer my question  certainly
he said his nerves were bad and i gave him a prescription for them
i am violating professional ethics when i tell you even as much as that  i could not tell him he lied
i think i looked it
but i hazarded a random shot
i thought perhaps i said watching him narrowly that it might be aboutnina carrington  for a moment i thought he was going to strike me
he grew livid and a small crooked bloodvessel in his temple swelled and throbbed curiously
then he forced a short laugh
who is nina carrington he asked
i am about to discover that i replied and he was quiet at once
it was not difficult to divine that he feared nina carrington a good deal more than he did the devil
our leavetaking was brief in fact we merely stared at each other over the waitingroom table with its litter of yearold magazines
then i turned and went out
to richfield i told warner and on the way i thought and thought hard
nina carrington nina carrington the roar and rush of the wheels seemed to sing the words
nina carrington n c and i then knew knew as surely as if i had seen the whole thing
there had been an n c on the suitcase belonging to the woman with the pitted face
how simple it all seemed
mattie bliss had been nina carrington
it was she warner had heard in the library
it was something she had told halsey that had taken him frantically to doctor walkers office and from there perhaps to his death
if we could find the woman we might find what had become of halsey
we were almost at richfield now so i kept on
my mind was not on my errand there now
it was back with halsey on that memorable night
what was it he had said to louise that had sent her up to sunnyside half wild with fear for him
i made up my mind as the car drew up before the tate cottage that i would see louise if i had to break into the house at night
almost exactly the same scene as before greeted my eyes at the cottage
mrs tate the babycarriage in the path the children at the swingall were the same
she came forward to meet me and i noticed that some of the anxious lines had gone out of her face
she looked young almost pretty
i am glad you have come back she said
i think i will have to be honest and give you back your money  why i asked
has the mother come  no but some one came and paid the boys board for a month
she talked to him for a long time but when i asked him afterward he didnt know her name  a young woman  not very young
about forty i suppose
she was small and fairhaired just a little bit gray and very sad
she was in deep mourning and i think when she came she expected to go at once
but the child lucien interested her
she talked to him for a long time and indeed she looked much happier when she left  you are sure this was not the real mother  o mercy no
why she didnt know which of the three was lucien
i thought perhaps she was a friend of yours but of course i didnt ask  she was notpockmarked i asked at a venture
no indeed
a skin like a babys
but perhaps you will know the initials
she gave lucien a handkerchief and forgot it
it was very fine blackbordered and it had three handworked letters in the cornerf
b a  no i said with truth enough she is not a friend of mine f b
a was fanny armstrong without a chance of doubt
with another warning to mrs tate as to silence we started back to sunnyside
so fanny armstrong knew of lucien wallace and was sufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his support
who was the childs mother and where was she
who was nina carrington
did either of them know where halsey was or what had happened to him
on the way home we passed the little cemetery where thomas had been laid to rest
i wondered if thomas could have helped us to find halsey had he lived
farther along was the more imposing burialground where arnold armstrong and his father lay in the shadow of a tall granite shaft
of the three i think thomas was the only one sincerely mourned
a tramp and the toothache   the bitterness toward the dead president of the traders bank seemed to grow with time
never popular his memory was execrated by people who had lost nothing but who were filled with disgust by constantly hearing new stories of the mans grasping avarice
the traders had been a favorite bank for small tradespeople and in its savings department it had solicited the smallest deposits
people who had thought to be selfsupporting to the last found themselves confronting the poorhouse their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away
all bank failures have this element however and the directors were trying to promise twenty per cent
on deposits
but like everything else those days the bank failure was almost forgotten by gertrude and myself
we did not mention jack bailey i had found nothing to change my impression of his guilt and gertrude knew how i felt
as for the murder of the bank presidents son i was of two minds
one day i thought gertrude knew or at least suspected that jack had done it the next i feared that it had been gertrude herself that night alone on the circular staircase
and then the mother of lucien wallace would obtrude herself and an almost equally good case might be made against her
there were times of course when i was disposed to throw all those suspicions aside and fix definitely on the unknown whoever that might be
i had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing nina carrington
the woman had gone without leaving a trace
marked as she was it should have been easy to follow her but she was not to be found
a description to one of the detectives on my arrival at home had started the ball rolling
but by night she had not been found
i told gertrude then about the telegram to louise when she had been ill before about my visit to doctor walker and my suspicions that mattie bliss and nina carrington were the same
she thought as i did that there was little doubt of it
i said nothing to her however of the detectives suspicions about alex
little things that i had not noticed at the time now came back to me
i had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps alex was a spy and that by taking him into the house i had played into the enemys hand
but at eight oclock that night alex himself appeared and with him a strange and repulsive individual
they made a queer pair for alex was almost as disreputable as the tramp and he had a badly swollen eye
gertrude had been sitting listlessly waiting for the evening message from mr jamieson but when the singular pair came in as they did without ceremony she jumped up and stood staring
winters the detective who watched the house at night followed them and kept his eyes sharply on alexs prisoner
for that was the situation as it developed
he was a tall lanky individual ragged and dirty and just now he looked both terrified and embarrassed
alex was too much engrossed to be either and to this day i dont think i ever asked him why he went off without permission the day before
miss innes alex began abruptly this man can tell us something very important about the disappearance of mr innes
i found him trying to sell this watch  he took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table
it was halseys watch
i had given it to him on his twentyfirst birthday i was dumb with apprehension
he says he had a pair of cufflinks also but he sold them  fer a dollarn half put in the disreputable individual hoarsely with an eye on the detective
he is notdead i implored
the tramp cleared his throat
nom he said huskily
he was used up pretty bad but he werent dead
he was comin to hisself when ihe stopped and looked at the detective
i didnt steal it mr winters he whined
i found it in the road honest to god i did  mr winters paid no attention to him
he was watching alex
id better tell what he told me alex broke in
it will be quicker
when jamiesonwhen mr jamieson calls up we can start him right
mr winters i found this man trying to sell that watch on fifth street
he offered it to me for three dollars  how did you know the watch winters snapped at him
i had seen it before many times
i used it at night when i was watching at the foot of the staircase the detective was satisfied
when he offered the watch to me i knew it and i pretended i was going to buy it
we went into an alley and i got the watch the tramp shivered
it was plain how alex had secured the watch
theni got the story from this fellow
he claims to have seen the whole affair
he says he was in an empty carin the car the automobile struck  the tramp broke in here and told his story with frequent interpretations by alex and mr winters
he used a strange medley in which familiar words took unfamiliar meanings but it was gradually made clear to us
on the night in question the tramp had been pounding his earthis stuck to me as being graphicin an empty boxcar along the siding at casanova
the train was going west and due to leave at dawn
the tramp and the brakey were friendly and things going well
about ten oclock perhaps earlier a terrific crash against the side of the car roused him
he tried to open the door but could not move it
he got out of the other side and just as he did so he heard some one groan
the habits of a lifetime made him cautious
he slipped on to the bumper of a car and peered through
an automobile had struck the car and stood there on two wheels
the tail lights were burning but the headlights were out
two men were stooping over some one who lay on the ground
then the taller of the two started on a dogtrot along the train looking for an empty
he found one four cars away and ran back again
the two lifted the unconscious man into the empty boxcar and getting in themselves stayed for three or four minutes
when they came out after closing the sliding door they cut up over the railroad embankment toward the town
one the short one seemed to limp
the tramp was wary
he waited for ten minutes or so
some women came down a path to the road and inspected the automobile
when they had gone he crawled into the boxcar and closed the door again
then he lighted a match
the figure of a man unconscious gagged and with his hands tied lay far at the end
the tramp lost no time he went through his pockets found a little money and the cufflinks and took them
then he loosened the gagit had been cruelly tightand went his way again closing the door of the boxcar
outside on the road he found the watch
he got on the fast freight east some time after and rode into the city
he had sold the cufflinks but on offering the watch to alex he had been copped  the story with its cold recital of villainy was done
i hardly knew if i were more anxious or less
that it was halsey there could be no doubt
how badly he was hurt how far he had been carried were the questions that demanded immediate answer
but it was the first real information we had had my boy had not been murdered outright
but instead of vague terrors there was now the real fear that he might be lying in some strange hospital receiving the casual attention commonly given to the charity cases
even this had we known it would have been paradise to the terrible truth
i wake yet and feel myself cold and trembling with the horror of halseys situation for three days after his disappearance
mr winters and alex disposed of the tramp with a warning
it was evident he had told us all he knew
we had occasion within a day or two to be doubly thankful that we had given him his freedom
when mr jamieson telephoned that night we had news for him he told me what i had not realized beforethat it would not be possible to find halsey at once even with this clue
the cars by this time three days might be scattered over the union
but he said to keep on hoping that it was the best news we had had
and in the meantime consumed with anxiety as we were things were happening at the house in rapid succession
we had one peaceful daythen liddy took sick in the night
i went in when i heard her groaning and found her with a hotwater bottle to her face and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy
toothache i asked not too gently
you deserve it
a woman of your age who would rather go around with an exposed nerve in her head than have the tooth pulled
it would be over in a moment  so would hanging liddy protested from behind the hotwater bottle
i was hunting around for cotton and laudanum
you have a tooth just like it yourself miss rachel she whimpered
and im sure doctor boyles been trying to take it out for years  there was no laudanum and liddy made a terrible fuss when i proposed carbolic acid just because i had put too much on the cotton once and burned her mouth
im sure it never did her any permanent harm indeed the doctor said afterward that living on liquid diet had been a splendid rest for her stomach
but she would have none of the acid and she kept me awake groaning so at last i got up and went to gertrudes door
to my surprise it was locked
i went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way
the bed was turned down and her dressinggown and nightdress lay ready in the little room next but gertrude was not there
she had not undressed
i dont know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute i stood there
through the door i could hear liddy grumbling with a squeal now and then when the pain stabbed harder
then automatically i got the laudanum and went back to her
it was fully a halfhour before liddys groans subsided
at intervals i went to the door into the hall and looked out but i saw and heard nothing suspicious
finally when liddy had dropped into a doze i even ventured as far as the head of the circular staircase but there floated up to me only the even breathing of winters the night detective sleeping just inside the entry
and then far off i heard the rapping noise that had lured louise down the staircase that other night two weeks before
it was over my head and very faintthree or four short muffled taps a pause and then again stealthily repeated
the sound of mr winters breathing was comforting with the thought that there was help within call something kept me from waking him
i did not move for a moment ridiculous things liddy had said about a ghosti am not at all superstitious except perhaps in the middle of the night with everything darkthings like that came back to me
almost beside me was the clothes chute
i could feel it but i could see nothing
as i stood listening intently i heard a sound near me
it was vague indefinite
then it ceased there was an uneasy movement and a grunt from the foot of the circular staircase and silence again
i stood perfectly still hardly daring to breathe
then i knew i had been right
some one was stealthily passing the head of the staircase and coming toward me in the dark
i leaned against the wall for supportmy knees were giving way
the steps were close now and suddenly i thought of gertrude
of course it was gertrude
i put out one hand in front of me but i touched nothing
my voice almost refused me but i managed to gasp out gertrude  good lord a mans voice exclaimed just beside me
and then i collapsed
i felt myself going felt some one catch me a horrible nauseathat was all i remembered
when i came to it was dawn
i was lying on the bed in louises room with the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me and there was a blanket from my own bed thrown over me
i felt weak and dizzy but i managed to get up and totter to the door
at the foot of the circular staircase mr winters was still asleep
hardly able to stand i crept back to my room
the door into gertrudes room was no longer locked she was sleeping like a tired child
and in my dressingroom liddy hugged a cold hotwater bottle and mumbled in her sleep
theres some things you cant hold with hand cuffs she was muttering thickly
a scrap of paper   for the first time in twenty years i kept my bed that day
liddy was alarmed to the point of hysteria and sent for doctor stewart just after breakfast
gertrude spent the morning with me reading somethingi forget what
i was too busy with my thoughts to listen
i had said nothing to the two detectives
if mr jamieson had been there i should have told him everything but i could not go to these strange men and tell them my niece had been missing in the middle of the night that she had not gone to bed at all that while i was searching for her through the house i had met a stranger who when i fainted had carried me into a room and left me there to get better or not as it might happen
the whole situation was terrible had the issues been less vital it would have been absurd
here we were guarded day and night by private detectives with an extra man to watch the grounds and yet we might as well have lived in a japanese paper house for all the protection we had
and there was something else the man i had met in the darkness had been even more startled than i and about his voice when he muttered his muffled exclamation there was something vaguely familiar
all that morning while gertrude read aloud and liddy watched for the doctor i was puzzling over that voice without result
and there were other things too
i wondered what gertrudes absence from her room had to do with it all or if it had any connection
i tried to think that she had heard the rapping noises before i did and gone to investigate but im afraid i was a moral coward that day
i could not ask her
perhaps the diversion was good for me
it took my mind from halsey and the story we had heard the night before
the day however was a long vigil with every ring of the telephone full of possibilities
doctor walker came up some time just after luncheon and asked for me
go down and see him i instructed gertrude
tell him i am outfor mercys sake dont say im sick
find out what he wants and from this time on instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted
i loathe that man  gertrude came back very soon her face rather flushed
he came to ask us to get out she said picking up her book with a jerk
he says louise armstrong wants to come here now that she is recovering  and what did you say  i said we were very sorry we could not leave but we would be delighted to have louise come up here with us
he looked daggers at me
and he wanted to know if we would recommend eliza as a cook
he has brought a patient a man out from town and is increasing his establishmentthats the way he put it  i wish him joy of eliza i said tartly
did he ask for halsey  yes
i told him that we were on the track last night and that it was only a question of time
he said he was glad although he didnt appear to be but he said not to be too sanguine  do you know what i believe i asked
i believe as firmly as i believe anything that doctor walker knows something about halsey and that he could put his finger on him if he wanted to  there were several things that day that bewildered me
about three oclock mr jamieson telephoned from the casanova station and warner went down to meet him
i got up and dressed hastily and the detective was shown up to my sittingroom
no news i asked as he entered
he tried to look encouraging without success
i noticed that he looked tired and dusty and although he was ordinarily impeccable in his appearance it was clear that he was at least two days from a razor
it wont be long now miss innes he said
i have come out here on a peculiar errand which i will tell you about later
first i want to ask some questions
did any one come out here yesterday to repair the telephone and examine the wires on the roof  yes i said promptly but it was not the telephone
he said the wiring might have caused the fire at the stable
i went up with him myself but he only looked around  mr jamieson smiled
good for you he applauded
dont allow any one in the house that you dont trust and dont trust anybody
all are not electricians who wear rubber gloves  he refused to explain further but he got a slip of paper out of his pocketbook and opened it carefully
listen he said
you heard this before and scoffed
in the light of recent developments i want you to read it again
you are a clever woman miss innes
just as surely as i sit here there is something in this house that is wanted very anxiously by a number of people
the lines are closing up miss innes  the paper was the one he had found among arnold armstrongs effects and i read it again  by altering the plans forrooms may be possible
the best way in my opinion would be tothe plan forin one of theroomschimney   i think i understand i said slowly
some one is searching for the secret room and the invaders  and the holes in the plaster  have been in the progress of his  or herinvestigations  her i asked
miss innes the detective said getting up i believe that somewhere in the walls of this house is hidden some of the money at least from the traders bank
i believe just as surely that young walker brought home from california the knowledge of something of the sort and failing in his effort to reinstall mrs armstrong and her daughter here he or a confederate has tried to break into the house
on two occasions i think he succeeded  on three at least i corrected
and then i told him about the night before
i have been thinking hard i concluded and i do not believe the man at the head of the circular staircase was doctor walker
i dont think he could have got in and the voice was not his  mr jamieson got up and paced the floor his hands behind him
there is something else that puzzles me he said stepping before me
who and what is the woman nina carrington
if it was she who came here as mattie bliss what did she tell halsey that sent him racing to doctor walkers and then to miss armstrong
if we could find that woman we would have the whole thing  mr
jamieson did you ever think that paul armstrong might not have died a natural death  that is the thing we are going to try to find out he replied
and then gertrude came in announcing a man below to see mr jamieson
i want you present at this interview miss innes he said
may riggs come up
he has left doctor walker and he has something he wants to tell us  riggs came into the room diffidently but mr jamieson put him at his ease
he kept a careful eye on me however and slid into a chair by the door when he was asked to sit down
now riggs began mr jamieson kindly
you are to say what you have to say before this lady  you promised youd keep it quiet mr jamieson riggs plainly did not trust me
there was nothing friendly in the glance he turned on me
yes yes
you will be protected
but first of all did you bring what you promised  riggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat and handed them over
mr jamieson examined them with lively satisfaction and passed them to me
the blueprints of sunnyside he said
what did i tell you
now riggs we are ready  id never have come to you mr jamieson he began if it hadnt been for miss armstrong
when mr innes was spirited away like and miss louise got sick because of it i thought things had gone far enough
id done some things for the doctor before that wouldnt just bear looking into but i turned a bit squeamish  did you help with that i asked leaning forward
no mam
i didnt even know of it until the next day when it came out in the casanova weekly ledger
but i know who did it all right
id better start at the beginning
when doctor walker went away to california with the armstrong family there was talk in the town that when he came back he would be married to miss armstrong and we all expected it
first thing i knew i got a letter from him in the west
he seemed to be excited and he said miss armstrong had taken a sudden notion to go home and he sent me some money
i was to watch for her to see if she went to sunnyside and wherever she was not to lose sight of her until he got home
i traced her to the lodge and i guess i scared you on the drive one night miss innes  and rosie i ejaculated
riggs grinned sheepishly
i only wanted to make sure miss louise was there
rosie started to run and i tried to stop her and tell her some sort of a story to account for my being there
but she wouldnt wait  and the broken chinain the basket  well broken chinas death to rubber tires he said
i hadnt any complaint against you people here and the dragon fly was a good car  so rosies highwayman was explained
well i telegraphed the doctor where miss louise was and i kept an eye on her
just a day or so before they came home with the body i got another letter telling me to watch for a woman who had been pitted with smallpox
her name was carrington and the doctor made things pretty strong
if i found any such woman loafing around i was not to lose sight of her for a minute until the doctor got back
well i would have had my hands full but the other woman didnt show up for a good while and when she did the doctor was home  riggs i asked suddenly did you get into this house a day or two after i took it at night  i did not miss innes
i have never been in the house before
well the carrington woman didnt show up until the night mr halsey disappeared
she came to the office late and the doctor was out
she waited around walking the floor and working herself into a passion
when the doctor didnt come back she was in an awful way
she wanted me to hunt him and when he didnt appear she called him names said he couldnt fool her
there was murder being done and she would see him swing for it
she struck me as being an ugly customer and when she left about eleven oclock and went across to the armstrong place i was not far behind her
she walked all around the house first looking up at the windows
then she rang the bell and the minute the door was opened she was through it and into the hall  how long did she stay  thats the queer part of it riggs said eagerly
she didnt come out that night at all
i went to bed at daylight and that was the last i heard of her until the next day when i saw her on a truck at the station covered with a sheet
shed been struck by the express and you would hardly have known herdead of course
i think she stayed all night in the armstrong house and the agent said she was crossing the track to take the uptrain to town when the express struck her  another circle i exclaimed
then we are just where we started  not so bad as that miss innes riggs said eagerly
nina carrington came from the town in california where mr armstrong died
why was the doctor so afraid of her
the carrington woman knew something
i lived with doctor walker seven years and i know him well
there are few things he is afraid of
i think he killed mr armstrong out in the west somewhere thats what i think
what else he did i dont knowbut he dismissed me and pretty nearly throttled mefor telling mr jamieson here about mr innes having been at his office the night he disappeared and about my hearing them quarreling  what was it warner overheard the woman say to mr innes in the library the detective asked me
she said i knew there was something wrong from the start
a man isnt well one day and dead the next without some reason  how perfectly it all seemed to fit
when churchyards yawn   it was on wednesday riggs told us the story of his connection with some incidents that had been previously unexplained
halsey had been gone since the friday night before and with the passage of each day i felt that his chances were lessening
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the boxcar locked in perhaps without water or food
i had read of cases where bodies had been found locked in cars on isolated sidings in the west and my spirits went down with every hour
his recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance and was due directly to the tramp alex had brought to sunnyside
it seems the man was grateful for his release and when he learned something of halseys whereabouts from another member of his fraternityfor it is a fraternityhe was prompt in letting us know
on wednesday evening mr jamieson who had been down at the armstrong house trying to see louiseand failingwas met near the gate at sunnyside by an individual precisely as repulsive and unkempt as the one alex had captured
the man knew the detective and he gave him a piece of dirty paper on which was scrawled the wordshes at city hospital johnsville the tramp who brought the paper pretended to know nothing except this the paper had been passed along from a hobo in johnsville who seemed to know the information would be valuable to us
again the long distance telephone came into requisition
mr jamieson called the hospital while we crowded around him
and when there was no longer any doubt that it was halsey and that he would probably recover we all laughed and cried together
i am sure i kissed liddy and i have had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr jamieson too in the excitement
anyhow by eleven oclock that night gertrude was on her way to johnsville three hundred and eighty miles away accompanied by rosie
the domestic force was now down to mary anne and liddy with the undergardeners wife coming every day to help out
fortunately warner and the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge
out of deference to liddy they washed their dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
they had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day
it was bacon hardtack and onions fried together
they were almost pathetically grateful however i noticed for an occasional broiled tenderloin
it was not until gertrude and rosie had gone and sunnyside had settled down for the night with winters at the foot of the staircase that mr jamieson broached a subject he had evidently planned before he came
miss innes he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are your nerves tonight  i have none i said happily
with halsey found my troubles have gone  i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual  the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
but if anything is going to occur dont dare to let me miss it  something is going to occur he said
and youre the only woman i can think of that i can take along he looked at his watch
dont ask me any questions miss innes
put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything  liddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
the detective was waiting in the hall and i was astonished to see doctor stewart with him
they were talking confidentially together but when i came down they ceased
there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in the darkness through the front door and into the night
i asked no questions
i felt that they were doing me honor in making me one of the party and i would show them i could be as silent as they
we went across the fields passing through the woods that reached almost to the ruins of the stable going over stiles now and then and sometimes stepping over low fences
once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from doctor stewart when he ran into a wire fence
we were joined at the end of five minutes by another man who fell into step with the doctor silently
he carried something over his shoulder which i could not make out
in this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes
i had lost all sense of direction i merely stumbled along in silence allowing mr jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path demanded
i hardly know what i expected
once when through a miscalculation i jumped a little short over a ditch and landed above my shoetops in the water and ooze i remember wondering if this were really i and if i had ever tasted life until that summer
i walked along with the water sloshing in my boots and i was actually cheerful
i remember whispering to mr jamieson that i had never seen the stars so lovely and that it was a mistake when the lord had made the night so beautiful to sleep through it
the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
i confess that just at that minute even sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot
we had paused at the edge of a level cleared place bordered all around with primly trimmed evergreen trees
between them i caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument or towering shaft
in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
we were on the edge of the casanova churchyard
i saw now both the man who had joined the party and the implements he carried
it was alex armed with two longhandled spades
after the first shock of surprise i flatter myself i was both cool and quiet
we went in single file between the rows of headstones and although when i found myself last i had an instinctive desire to keep looking back over my shoulder i found that the first uneasiness past a cemetery at night is much the same as any other country place filled with vague shadows and unexpected noises
once indeedbut mr jamieson said it was an owl and i tried to believe him
in the shadow of the armstrong granite shaft we stopped
i think the doctor wanted to send me back
its no place for a woman i heard him protesting angrily
but the detective said something about witnesses and the doctor only came over and felt my pulse
anyhow i dont believe youre any worse off here than you would be in that nightmare of a house he said finally and put his coat on the steps of the shaft for me to sit on
there is an air of finality about a grave one watches the earth thrown in with the feeling that this is the end
whatever has gone before whatever is to come in eternity that particular temple of the soul has been given back to the elements from which it came
thus there is a sense of desecration of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things in resurrecting a body from its mother clay
and yet that night in the casanova churchyard i sat quietly by and watched alex and mr jamieson steaming over their work without a single qualm except the fear of detection
the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
once in a while he came over to me and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder
i never expected to come to this he said once
theres one thing sureill not be suspected of complicity
a doctor is generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up  the uncanny moment came when alex and jamieson tossed the spades on the grass and i confess i hid my face
there was a period of stress i think while the heavy coffin was being raised
i felt that my composure was going and for fear i would shriek i tried to think of something elsewhat time gertrude would reach halseyanything but the grisly reality that lay just beyond me on the grass
and then i heard a low exclamation from the detective and i felt the pressure of the doctors fingers on my arm
now miss innes he said gently
if you will come over  i held on to him frantically and somehow i got there and looked down
the lid of the casket had been raised and a silver plate on it proved we had made no mistake
but the face that showed in the light of the lantern was a face i had never seen before
the man who lay before us was not paul armstrong
between two fireplaces   what with the excitement of the discovery the walk home under the stars in wet shoes and draggled skirts and getting upstairs and undressed without rousing liddy i was completely used up
what to do with my boots was the greatest puzzle of all there being no place in the house safe from liddy until i decided to slip upstairs the next morning and drop them into the hole the ghost had made in the trunkroom wall
i went asleep as soon as i reached this decision and in my dreams i lived over again the events of the night
again i saw the group around the silent figure on the grass and again as had happened at the grave i heard alexs voice tense and triumphant  then weve got them he said
only in my dreams he said it over and over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears
i wakened early in spite of my fatigue and lay there thinking
who was alex
i no longer believed that he was a gardener
who was the man whose body we had resurrected
and where was paul armstrong
probably living safely in some extraditionless country on the fortune he had stolen
did louise and her mother know of the shameful and wicked deception
what had thomas known and mrs watson
who was nina carrington
this last question it seemed to me was answered
in some way the woman had learned of the substitution and had tried to use her knowledge for blackmail
nina carringtons own story died with her but however it happened it was clear that she had carried her knowledge to halsey the afternoon gertrude and i were looking for clues to the man i had shot on the east veranda
halsey had been half crazed by what he heard it was evident that louise was marrying doctor walker to keep the shameful secret for her mothers sake
halsey always reckless had gone at once to doctor walker and denounced him
there had been a scene and he left on his way to the station to meet and notify mr jamieson of what he had learned
the doctor was active mentally and physically
accompanied perhaps by riggs who had shown himself not overscrupulous until he quarreled with his employer he had gone across to the railroad embankment and by jumping in front of the car had caused halsey to swerve
the rest of the story we knew
that was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and evening it was almost correctnot quite
there was a telegram that morning from gertrude
halsey conscious and improving
probably home in day or so
gertrude   with halsey found and improving in health and with at last something to work on i began that day thursday with fresh courage
as mr jamieson had said the lines were closing up
that i was to be caught and almost finished in the closing was happily unknown to us all
it was late when i got up
i lay in my bed looking around the four walls of the room and trying to imagine behind what one of them a secret chamber might lie
certainly in daylight sunnyside deserved its name never was a house more cheery and open less sinister in general appearance
there was not a corner apparently that was not open and aboveboard and yet somewhere behind its handsomely papered walls i believed firmly that there lay a hidden room with all the possibilities it would involve
i made a mental note to have the house measured during the day to discover any discrepancy between the outer and inner walls and i tried to recall again the exact wording of the paper jamieson had found
the slip had said chimney it was the only clue and a house as large as sunnyside was full of them
there was an open fireplace in my dressingroom but none in the bedroom and as i lay there looking around i thought of something that made me sit up suddenly
the trunkroom just over my head had an open fireplace and a brick chimney and yet there was nothing of the kind in my room
i got out of bed and examined the opposite wall closely
there was apparently no flue and i knew there was none in the hall just beneath
the house was heated by steam as i have said before
in the livingroom was a huge open fireplace but it was on the other side
why did the trunkroom have both a radiator and an open fireplace
architects were not usually erratic
it was not fifteen minutes before i was upstairs armed with a tapemeasure in lieu of a footrule eager to justify mr jamiesons opinion of my intelligence and firmly resolved not to tell him of my suspicion until i had more than theory to go on
the hole in the trunkroom wall still yawned there between the chimney and the outer wall
i examined it again with no new result
the space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one however had a new significance
the hole showed only one side of the chimney and i determined to investigate what lay in the space on the other side of the mantel
i worked feverishly
liddy had gone to the village to market it being her firm belief that the store people sent short measure unless she watched the scales and that since the failure of the traders bank we must watch the corners and i knew that what i wanted to do must be done before she came back
i had no tools but after rummaging around i found a pair of garden scissors and a hatchet and thus armed i set to work
the plaster came out easily the lathing was more obstinate
it gave under the blows only to spring back into place again and the necessity for caution made it doubly hard
i had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went through and fell with what sounded like the report of a gun to my overstrained nerves
i sat on a trunk waiting to hear liddy fly up the stairs with the household behind her like the tail of a comet
but nothing happened and with a growing feeling of uncanniness i set to work enlarging the opening
the result was absolutely nil
when i could hold a lighted candle in the opening i saw precisely what i had seen on the other side of the chimneya space between the true wall and the false one possibly seven feet long and about three feet wide
it was in no sense of the word a secret chamber and it was evident it had not been disturbed since the house was built
it was a supreme disappointment
it had been mr jamiesons idea that the hidden room if there was one would be found somewhere near the circular staircase
in fact i knew that he had once investigated the entire length of the clothes chute hanging to a rope with this in view
i was reluctantly about to concede that he had been right when my eyes fell on the mantel and fireplace
the latter had evidently never been used it was closed with a metal fire front and only when the front refused to move and investigation showed that it was not intended to be moved did my spirits revive
i hurried into the next room
yes sure enough there was a similar mantel and fireplace there similarly closed
in both rooms the chimney flue extended well out from the wall
i measured with the tapeline my hands trembling so that i could scarcely hold it
they extended two feet and a half into each room which with the three feet of space between the two partitions made eight feet to be accounted for
eight feet in one direction and almost seven in the otherwhat a chimney it was
but i had only located the hidden room
i was not in it and no amount of pressing on the carving of the wooden mantels no search of the floors for loose boards none of the customary methods availed at all
that there was a means of entrance and probably a simple one i could be certain
but what
what would i find if i did get in
was the detective right and were the bonds and money from the traders bank there
or was our whole theory wrong
would not paul armstrong have taken his booty with him
if he had not and if doctor walker was in the secret he would have known how to enter the chimney room
thenwho had dug the other hole in the false partition
anne watsons story   liddy discovered the fresh break in the trunkroom wall while we were at luncheon and ran shrieking down the stairs
she maintained that as she entered unseen hands had been digging at the plaster that they had stopped when she went in and she had felt a gust of cold damp air
in support of her story she carried in my wet and muddy boots that i had unluckily forgotten to hide and held them out to the detective and myself
what did i tell you she said dramatically
look at em
theyre yours miss racheland covered with mud and soaked to the tops
i tell you you can scoff all you like something has been wearing your shoes
as sure as you sit there theres the smell of the graveyard on them
how do we know they werent tramping through the casanova churchyard last night and sitting on the graves  mr jamieson almost choked to death
i wouldnt be at all surprised if they were doing that very thing liddy he said when he got his breath
they certainly look like it  i think the detective had a plan on which he was working and which was meant to be a coup
but things went so fast there was no time to carry it into effect
the first thing that occurred was a message from the charity hospital that mrs watson was dying and had asked for me
i did not care much about going
there is a sort of melancholy pleasure to be had out of a funeral with its pomp and ceremony but i shrank from a deathbed
however liddy got out the black things and the crape veil i keep for such occasions and i went
i left mr jamieson and the day detective going over every inch of the circular staircase pounding probing and measuring
i was inwardly elated to think of the surprise i was going to give them that night as it turned out i did surprise them almost into spasms
i drove from the train to the charity hospital and was at once taken to a ward
there in a graywalled room in a high iron bed lay mrs watson
she was very weak and she only opened her eyes and looked at me when i sat down beside her
i was consciencestricken
we had been so engrossed that i had left this poor creature to die without even a word of sympathy
the nurse gave her a stimulant and in a little while she was able to talk
so broken and halfcoherent however was her story that i shall tell it in my own way
in an hour from the time i entered the charity hospital i had heard a sad and pitiful narrative and had seen a woman slip into the unconsciousness that is only a step from death
briefly then the housekeepers story was this  she was almost forty years old and had been the sistermother of a large family of children
one by one they had died and been buried beside their parents in a little town in the middle west
there was only one sister left the baby lucy
on her the older girl had lavished all the love of an impulsive and emotional nature
when anne the elder was thirtytwo and lucy was nineteen a young man had come to the town
he was going east after spending the summer at a celebrated ranch in wyomingone of those places where wealthy men send worthless and dissipated sons for a season of temperance fresh air and hunting
the sisters of course knew nothing of this and the young mans ardor rather carried them away
in a word seven years before lucy haswell had married a young man whose name was given as aubrey wallace
anne haswell had married a carpenter in her native town and was a widow
for three months everything went fairly well
aubrey took his bride to chicago where they lived at a hotel
perhaps the very unsophistication that had charmed him in valley mill jarred on him in the city
he had been far from a model husband even for the three months and when he disappeared anne was almost thankful
it was different with the young wife however
she drooped and fretted and on the birth of her baby boy she had died
anne took the child and named him lucien
anne had had no children of her own and on lucien she had lavished all her aborted maternal instinct
on one thing she was determined however that was that aubrey wallace should educate his boy
it was a part of her devotion to the child that she should be ambitious for him he must have every opportunity
and so she came east
she drifted around doing plain sewing and keeping a home somewhere always for the boy
finally however she realized that her only training had been domestic and she put the boy in an episcopalian home and secured the position of housekeeper to the armstrongs
there she found luciens father this time under his own name
it was arnold armstrong
i gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time in annes mind
she told him of the boy and threatened exposure if he did not provide for him
indeed for a time he did so
then he realized that lucien was the ruling passion in this lonely womans life
he found out where the child was hidden and threatened to take him away
anne was frantic
the positions became reversed
where arnold had given money for luciens support as the years went on he forced money from anne watson instead until she was always penniless
the lower arnold sank in the scale the heavier his demands became
with the rupture between him and his family things were worse
anne took the child from the home and hid him in a farmhouse near casanova on the claysburg road
there she went sometimes to see the boy and there he had taken fever
the people were germans and he called the farmers wife grossmutter
he had grown into a beautiful boy and he was all anne had to live for
the armstrongs left for california and arnolds persecutions began anew
he was furious over the childs disappearance and she was afraid he would do her some hurt
she left the big house and went down to the lodge
when i had rented sunnyside however she had thought the persecutions would stop
she had applied for the position of housekeeper and secured it
that had been on saturday
that night louise arrived unexpectedly
thomas sent for mrs watson and then went for arnold armstrong at the greenwood club
anne had been fond of louiseshe reminded her of lucy
she did not know what the trouble was but louise had been in a state of terrible excitement
mrs watson tried to hide from arnold but he was ugly
he left the lodge and went up to the house about twothirty was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very soon
something had occurred she didnt know what but very soon mr innes and another gentleman left using the car
thomas and she had got louise quiet and a little before three mrs watson started up to the house
thomas had a key to the east entry and gave it to her
on the way across the lawn she was confronted by arnold who for some reason was determined to get into the house
he had a golfstick in his hand that he had picked up somewhere and on her refusal he had struck her with it
one hand had been badly cut and it was that poisoning having set in which was killing her
she broke away in a frenzy of rage and fear and got into the house while gertrude and jack bailey were at the front door
she went upstairs hardly knowing what she was doing
gertrudes door was open and halseys revolver lay there on the bed
she picked it up and turning ran part way down the circular staircase
she could hear arnold fumbling at the lock outside
she slipped down quietly and opened the door he was inside before she had got back to the stairs
it was quite dark but she could see his white shirtbosom
from the fourth step she fired
as he fell somebody in the billiardroom screamed and ran
when the alarm was raised she had had no time to get upstairs she hid in the west wing until every one was down on the lower floor
then she slipped upstairs and threw the revolver out of an upper window going down again in time to admit the men from the greenwood club
if thomas had suspected he had never told
when she found the hand arnold had injured was growing worse she gave the address of lucien at richfield to the old man and almost a hundred dollars
the money was for luciens board until she recovered
she had sent for me to ask me if i would try to interest the armstrongs in the child
when she found herself growing worse she had written to mrs armstrong telling her nothing but that arnolds legitimate child was at richfield and imploring her to recognize him
she was dying the boy was an armstrong and entitled to his fathers share of the estate
the papers were in her trunk at sunnyside with letters from the dead man that would prove what she said
she was going she would not be judged by earthly laws and somewhere else perhaps lucy would plead for her
it was she who had crept down the circular staircase drawn by a magnet that night mr jamieson had heard some one there
pursued she had fled madly anywherethrough the first door she came to
she had fallen down the clothes chute and been saved by the basket beneath
i could have cried with relief then it had not been gertrude after all
that was the story
sad and tragic though it was the very telling of it seemed to relieve the dying woman
she did not know that thomas was dead and i did not tell her
i promised to look after little lucien and sat with her until the intervals of consciousness grew shorter and finally ceased altogether
she died that night
at the foot of the stairs   as i drove rapidly up to the house from casanova station in the hack i saw the detective burns loitering across the street from the walker place
so jamieson was putting the screws onlightly now but ready to give them a twist or two i felt certain very soon
the house was quiet
two steps of the circular staircase had been pried off without result and beyond a second message from gertrude that halsey insisted on coming home and they would arrive that night there was nothing new
mr jamieson having failed to locate the secret room had gone to the village
i learned afterwards that he called at doctor walkers under pretense of an attack of acute indigestion and before he left had inquired about the evening trains to the city
he said he had wasted a lot of time on the case and a good bit of the mystery was in my imagination
the doctor was under the impression that the house was guarded day and night
well give a place a reputation like that and you dont need a guard at allthus jamieson
and sure enough late in the afternoon the two private detectives accompanied by mr jamieson walked down the main street of casanova and took a citybound train
that they got off at the next station and walked back again to sunnyside at dusk was not known at the time
personally i knew nothing of either move i had other things to absorb me at that time
liddy brought me some tea while i rested after my trip and on the tray was a small book from the casanova library
it was called the unseen world and had a cheerful cover on which a halfdozen sheeted figures linked hands around a headstone
at this point in my story halsey always says trust a woman to add two and two together and make six to which i retort that if two and two plus x make six then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world
that a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four
the depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect of seeing halsey again that night
it was about five oclock when liddy left me for a nap before dinner having put me into a gray silk dressinggown and a pair of slippers
i listened to her retreating footsteps and as soon as she was safely below stairs i went up to the trunkroom
the place had not been disturbed and i proceeded at once to try to discover the entrance to the hidden room
the openings on either side as i have said showed nothing but perhaps three feet of brick wall
there was no sign of an entranceno levers no hinges to give a hint
either the mantel or the roof i decided and after a halfhour at the mantel productive of absolutely no result i decided to try the roof
i am not fond of a height
the few occasions on which i have climbed a stepladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the knees
the top of the washington monument is as impossible to me as the elevation of the presidential chair
and yeti climbed out on to the sunnyside roof without a seconds hesitation
like a dog on a scent like my bearskin progenitor with his spear and his wild boar to me now there was the lust of the chase the frenzy of pursuit the dust of battle
i got quite a little of the latter on me as i climbed from the unfinished ballroom out through a window to the roof of the east wing of the building which was only two stories in height
once out there access to the top of the main building was rendered easyat least it looked easyby a small vertical iron ladder fastened to the wall outside of the ballroom and perhaps twelve feet high
the twelve feet looked short from below but they were difficult to climb
i gathered my silk gown around me and succeeded finally in making the top of the ladder
once there however i was completely out of breath
i sat down my feet on the top rung and put my hair pins in more securely while the wind bellowed my dressinggown out like a sail
i had torn a great strip of the silk loose and now i ruthlessly finished the destruction of my gown by jerking it free and tying it around my head
from far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar distinctness
i could hear the paper boy whistling down the drive and i heard something else
i heard the thud of a stone and a spit followed by a long and startled meiou from beulah
i forgot my fear of a height and advanced boldly almost to the edge of the roof
it was halfpast six by that time and growing dusk
you boy down there i called
the paper boy turned and looked around
then seeing nobody he raised his eyes
it was a moment before he located me when he did he stood for one moment as if paralyzed then he gave a horrible yell and dropping his papers bolted across the lawn to the road without stopping to look around
once he fell and his impetus was so great that he turned an involuntary somersault
he was up and off again without any perceptible pause and he leaped the hedgewhich i am sure under ordinary stress would have been a feat for a man
i am glad in this way to settle the gray lady story which is still a choice morsel in casanova
i believe the moral deduced by the village was that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at a black cat
with johnny sweeny a cloud of dust down the road and the dinnerhour approaching i hurried on with my investigations
luckily the roof was flat and i was able to go over every inch of it
but the result was disappointing no trapdoor revealed itself no glass window nothing but a couple of pipes two inches across and standing perhaps eighteen inches high and three feet apart with a cap to prevent rain from entering and raised to permit the passage of air
i picked up a pebble from the roof and dropped it down listening with my ear at one of the pipes
i could hear it strike on something with a sharp metallic sound but it was impossible for me to tell how far it had gone
i gave up finally and went down the ladder again getting in through the ballroom window without being observed
i went back at once to the trunkroom and sitting down on a box i gave my mind as consistently as i could to the problem before me
if the pipes in the roof were ventilators to the secret room and there was no trapdoor above the entrance was probably in one of the two rooms between which it layunless indeed the room had been built and the opening then closed with a brick and mortar wall
the mantel fascinated me
made of wood and carved the more i looked the more i wondered that i had not noticed before the absurdity of such a mantel in such a place
it was covered with scrolls and panels and finally by the merest accident i pushed one of the panels to the side
it moved easily revealing a small brass knob
it is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and despair and not a little fear of what lay beyond with which i twisted and turned the knob
it moved but nothing seemed to happen and then i discovered the trouble
i pushed the knob vigorously to one side and the whole mantel swung loose from the wall almost a foot revealing a cavernous space beyond
i took a long breath closed the door from the trunkroom into the hallthank heaven i did not lock itand pulling the manteldoor wide open i stepped into the chimneyroom
i had time to get a hazy view of a small portable safe a common wooden table and a chairthen the mantel door swung to and clicked behind me
i stood quite still for a moment in the darkness unable to comprehend what had happened
then i turned and beat furiously at the door with my fists
it was closed and locked again and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth wooden surface without a sign of a knob
i was furiously angryat myself at the mantel door at everything
i did not fear suffocation before the thought had come to me i had already seen a gleam of light from the two small ventilating pipes in the roof
they supplied air but nothing else
the room itself was shrouded in blackness
i sat down in the stiffbacked chair and tried to remember how many days one could live without food and water
when that grew monotonous and rather painful i got up and according to the timehonored rule for people shut in unknown and inkblack prisons i felt my way aroundit was small enough goodness knows
i felt nothing but a splintery surface of boards and in endeavoring to get back to the chair something struck me full in the face and fell with the noise of a thousand explosions to the ground
when i had gathered up my nerves again i found it had been the bulb of a swinging electric light and that had it not been for the accident i might have starved to death in an illuminated sepulcher
i must have dozed off
i am sure i did not faint
i was never more composed in my life
i remember planning if i were not discovered who would have my things
i knew liddy would want my heliotrope poplin and shes a fright in lavender
once or twice i heard mice in the partitions and so i sat on the table with my feet on the chair
i imagined i could hear the search going on through the house and once some one came into the trunkroom i could distinctly hear footsteps
in the chimney
in the chimney i called with all my might and was rewarded by a piercing shriek from liddy and the slam of the trunkroom door
i felt easier after that although the room was oppressively hot and enervating
i had no doubt the search for me would now come in the right direction and after a little i dropped into a doze
how long i slept i do not know
it must have been several hours for i had been tired from a busy day and i wakened stiff from my awkward position
i could not remember where i was for a few minutes and my head felt heavy and congested
gradually i roused to my surroundings and to the fact that in spite of the ventilators the air was bad and growing worse
i was breathing long gasping respirations and my face was damp and clammy
i must have been there a long time and the searchers were probably hunting outside the house dredging the creek or beating the woodland
i knew that another hour or two would find me unconscious and with my inability to cry out would go my only chance of rescue
it was the combination of bad air and heat probably for some inadequate ventilation was coming through the pipes
i tried to retain my consciousness by walking the length of the room and back over and over but i had not the strength to keep it up so i sat down on the table again my back against the wall
the house was very still
once my straining ears seemed to catch a footfall beneath me possibly in my own room
i groped for the chair from the table and pounded with it frantically on the floor
but nothing happened i realized bitterly that if the sound was heard at all no doubt it was classed with the other rappings that had so alarmed us recently
it was impossible to judge the flight of time
i measured five minutes by counting my pulse allowing seventytwo beats to the minute
but it took eternities and toward the last i found it hard to count my head was confused
and theni heard sounds from below me in the house
there was a peculiar throbbing vibrating noise that i felt rather than heard much like the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city
for one awful moment i thought the house was on fire and every drop of blood in my body gathered around my heart then i knew
it was the engine of the automobile and halsey had come back
hope sprang up afresh
halseys clear head and gertrudes intuition might do what liddys hysteria and three detectives had failed in
after a time i thought i had been right
there was certainly something going on down below doors were slamming people were hurrying through the halls and certain high notes of excited voices penetrated to me shrilly
i hoped they were coming closer but after a time the sounds died away below and i was left to the silence and heat to the weight of the darkness to the oppression of walls that seemed to close in on me and stifle me
the first warning i had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock of the manteldoor
with my mouth open to scream i stopped
perhaps the situation had rendered me acute perhaps it was instinctive
whatever it was i sat without moving and some one outside in absolute stillness ran his fingers over the carving of the mantel andfound the panel
now the sounds below redoubled from the clatter and jarring i knew that several people were running up the stairs and as the sounds approached i could even hear what they said
watch the end staircases jamieson was shouting
damnationtheres no light here and then a second later
all together now
onetwothree  the door into the trunkroom had been locked from the inside
at the second that it gave opening against the wall with a crash and evidently tumbling somebody into the room the stealthy fingers beyond the manteldoor gave the knob the proper impetus andthe door swung open and closed again
onlyand liddy always screams and puts her fingers in her ears at this pointonly now i was not alone in the chimney room
there was some one else in the darkness some one who breathed hard and who was so close i could have touched him with my hand
i was in a paralysis of terror
outside there were excited voices and incredulous oaths
the trunks were being jerked around in a frantic search the windows were thrown open only to show a sheer drop of forty feet
and the man in the room with me leaned against the manteldoor and listened
his pursuers were plainly baffled i heard him draw a long breath and turn to grope his way through the blackness
thenhe touched my hand cold clammy deathlike
a hand in an empty room
he drew in his breath the sharp intaking of horror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed
beyond jerking his hand away instantly he made no movement
i think absolute terror had him by the throat
then he stepped back without turning retreating foot by foot from the dread in the corner and i do not think he breathed
then with the relief of space between us i screamed earsplittingly madly and they heard me outside
in the chimney i shrieked
behind the mantel
the mantel  with an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me and i screamed again
in his blind fury he had missed me i heard him strike the wall
that one time i eluded him i was across the room and i had got the chair
he stood for a second listening thenhe made another rush and i struck out with my weapon
i think it stunned him for i had a seconds respite when i could hear him breathing and some one shouted outside  wecantgetin
howdoesitopen  but the man in the room had changed his tactics
i knew he was creeping on me inch by inch and i could not tell from where
and thenhe caught me
he held his hand over my mouth and i bit him
i was helpless stranglingand some one was trying to break in the mantel from outside
it began to yield somewhere for a thin wedge of yellowish light was reflected on the opposite wall
when he saw that my assailant dropped me with a curse thenthe opposite wall swung open noiselessly closed again without a sound and i was alone
the intruder was gone
in the next room i called wildly
the next room but the sound of blows on the mantel drowned my voice
by the time i had made them understand a couple of minutes had elapsed
the pursuit was taken up then by all except alex who was determined to liberate me
when i stepped out into the trunkroom a free woman again i could hear the chase far below
i must say for all alexs anxiety to set me free he paid little enough attention to my plight
he jumped through the opening into the secret room and picked up the portable safe
i am going to put this in mr halseys room miss innes he said and i shall send one of the detectives to guard it  i hardly heard him
i wanted to laugh and cry in the same breathto crawl into bed and have a cup of tea and scold liddy and do any of the thousand natural things that i had never expected to do again
and the air
the touch of the cool night air on my face
as alex and i reached the second floor mr jamieson met us
he was grave and quiet and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw the safe
will you come with me for a moment miss innes he asked soberly and on my assenting he led the way to the east wing
there were lights moving around below and some of the maids were standing gaping down
they screamed when they saw me and drew back to let me pass
there was a sort of hush over the scene alex behind me muttered something i could not hear and brushed past me without ceremony
then i realized that a man was lying doubled up at the foot of the staircase and that alex was stooping over him
as i came slowly down winters stepped back and alex straightened himself looking at me across the body with impenetrable eyes
in his hand he held a shaggy gray wig and before me on the floor lay the man whose headstone stood in casanova churchyardpaul armstrong
winters told the story in a dozen words
in his headlong flight down the circular staircase with winters just behind paul armstrong had pitched forward violently struck his head against the door to the east veranda and probably broken his neck
he had died as winters reached him
as the detective finished i saw halsey pale and shaken in the cardroom doorway and for the first time that night i lost my selfcontrol
i put my arms around my boy and for a moment he had to support me
a second later over halseys shoulder i saw something that turned my emotion into other channels for behind him in the shadowy cardroom were gertrude and alex the gardener andthere is no use mincing mattershe was kissing her
i was unable to speak
twice i opened my mouth then i turned halsey around and pointed
they were quite unconscious of us her head was on his shoulder his face against her hair
as it happened it was mr jamieson who broke up the tableau
he stepped over to alex and touched him on the arm
and now he said quietly how long are you and i to play our little comedy mr bailey     the odds and ends   of doctor walkers sensational escape that night to south america of the recovery of over a million dollars in cash and securities in the safe from the chimney roomthe papers have kept the public well informed
of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been singularly silent
the inner history has never been told
mr jamieson got all kinds of credit and some of it he deserved but if jack bailey as alex had not traced halsey and insisted on the disinterring of paul armstrongs casket if he had not suspected the truth from the start where would the detective have been
when halsey learned the truth he insisted on going the next morning weak as he was to louise and by night she was at sunnyside under gertrudes particular care while her mother had gone to barbara fitzhughs
what halsey said to mrs armstrong i never knew but that he was considerate and chivalrous i feel confident
it was halseys way always with women
he and louise had no conversation together until that night
gertrude and alexi mean jackhad gone for a walk although it was nine oclock and anybody but a pair of young geese would have known that dew was falling and that it is next to impossible to get rid of a summer cold
at half after nine growing weary of my own company i went downstairs to find the young people
at the door of the livingroom i paused
gertrude and jack had returned and were there sitting together on a divan with only one lamp lighted
they did not see or hear me and i beat a hasty retreat to the library
but here again i was driven back
louise was sitting in a deep chair looking the happiest i had ever seen her with halsey on the arm of the chair holding her close
it was no place for an elderly spinster
i retired to my upstairs sittingroom and got out eliza klinefelters lavender slippers
ah well the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor again
the next day by degrees i got the whole story
paul armstrong had a besetting evilthe love of money
common enough but he loved money not for what it would buy but for its own sake
an examination of the books showed no irregularities in the past year since john had been cashier but before that in the time of anderson the old cashier who had died much strange juggling had been done with the records
the railroad in new mexico had apparently drained the bankers private fortune and he determined to retrieve it by one stroke
this was nothing less than the looting of the banks securities turning them into money and making his escape
but the law has long arms
paul armstrong evidently studied the situation carefully
just as the only good indian is a dead indian so the only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter
he decided to die to all appearances and when the hue and cry subsided he would be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere he wished
the first necessity was an accomplice
the connivance of doctor walker was suggested by his love for louise
the man was unscrupulous and with the girl as a bait paul armstrong soon had him fast
the plan was apparently the acme of simplicity a small town in the west an attack of heart disease a body from a medical college dissectingroom shipped in a trunk to doctor walker by a colleague in san francisco and palmed off for the supposed dead banker
what was simpler
the woman nina carrington was the cog that slipped
what she only suspected what she really knew we never learned
she was a chambermaid in the hotel at c and it was evidently her intention to blackmail doctor walker
his position at that time was uncomfortable to pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession
he denied the whole thing and she went to halsey
it was this that had taken halsey to the doctor the night he disappeared
he accused the doctor of the deception and crossing the lawn had said something cruel to louise
then furious at her apparent connivance he had started for the station
doctor walker and paul armstrongthe latter still lame where i had shot himhurried across to the embankment certain only of one thing
halsey must not tell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed from the chimneyroom
they stepped into the road in front of the car to stop it and fate played into their hands
the car struck the train and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the road
this they did as i have told
for three days halsey lay in the box car tied hand and foot suffering tortures of thirst delirious at times and discovered by a tramp at johnsville only in time to save his life
to go back to paul armstrong
at the last moment his plans had been frustrated
sunnyside with its hoard in the chimneyroom had been rented without his knowledge
attempts to dislodge me having failed he was driven to breaking into his own house
the ladder in the chute the burning of the stable and the entrance through the cardroom windowall were in the course of a desperate attempt to get into the chimneyroom
louise and her mother had from the first been the great stumblingblocks
the plan had been to send louise away until it was too late for her to interfere but she came back to the hotel at c just at the wrong time
there was a terrible scene
the girl was told that something of the kind was necessary that the bank was about to close and her stepfather would either avoid arrest and disgrace in this way or kill himself
fanny armstrong was a weakling but louise was more difficult to manage
she had no love for her stepfather but her devotion to her mother was entire selfsacrificing
forced into acquiescence by her mothers appeals overwhelmed by the situation the girl consented and fled
from somewhere in colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to jack bailey at the traders bank
trapped as she was she did not want to see an innocent man arrested
the telegram received on thursday had sent the cashier to the bank that night in a frenzy
louise arrived at sunnyside and found the house rented
not knowing what to do she sent for arnold at the greenwood club and told him a little not all
she told him that there was something wrong and that the bank was about to close
that his father was responsible
of the conspiracy she said nothing
to her surprise arnold already knew through bailey that night that things were not right
moreover he suspected what louise did not that the money was hidden at sunnyside
he had a scrap of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere
his inherited cupidity was aroused
eager to get halsey and jack bailey out of the house he went up to the east entry and in the billiardroom gave the cashier what he had refused earlier in the eveningthe address of paul armstrong in california and a telegram which had been forwarded to the club for bailey from doctor walker
it was in response to one bailey had sent and it said that paul armstrong was very ill  bailey was almost desperate
he decided to go west and find paul armstrong and to force him to disgorge
but the catastrophe at the bank occurred sooner than he had expected
on the moment of starting west at andrews station where mr jamieson had located the car he read that the bank had closed and going back surrendered himself
john bailey had known paul armstrong intimately
he did not believe that the money was gone in fact it was hardly possible in the interval since the securities had been taken
where was it
and from some chance remark let fall some months earlier by arnold armstrong at a dinner bailey felt sure there was a hidden room at sunnyside
he tried to see the architect of the building but like the contractor if he knew of the such a room he refused any information
it was halseys idea that john bailey come to the house as a gardener and pursue his investigations as he could
his smooth upper lip had been sufficient disguise with his change of clothes and a haircut by a country barber
so it was alex jack bailey who had been our ghost
not only had he alarmedlouise and himself he admittedon the circular staircase but he had dug the hole in the trunkroom wall and later sent eliza into hysteria
the note liddy had found in gertrudes scrapbasket was from him and it was he who had startled me into unconsciousness by the clothes chute and with gertrudes help had carried me to louises room
gertrude i learned had watched all night beside me in an extremity of anxiety about me
that old thomas had seen his master and thought he had seen the sunnyside ghost there could be no doubt
of that story of thomas about seeing jack bailey in the footpath between the club and sunnyside the night liddy and i heard the noise on the circular staircasethat too was right
on the night before arnold armstrong was murdered jack bailey had made his first attempt to search for the secret room
he secured arnolds keys from his room at the club and got into the house armed with a golfstick for sounding the walls
he ran against the hamper at the head of the stairs caught his cufflink in it and dropped the golfstick with a crash
he was glad enough to get away without an alarm being raised and he took the owl train to town
the oddest thing to me was that mr jamieson had known for some time that alex was jack bailey
but the face of the pseudogardener was very queer indeed when that night in the cardroom the detective turned to him and said  how long are you and i going to play our little comedy mr
bailey  well it is all over now
paul armstrong rests in casanova churchyard and this time there is no mistake
i went to the funeral because i wanted to be sure he was really buried and i looked at the step of the shaft where i had sat that night and wondered if it was all real
sunnyside is for saleno i shall not buy it
little lucien armstrong is living with his stepgrandmother and she is recovering gradually from troubles that had extended over the entire period of her second marriage
anne watson lies not far from the man she killed and who as surely caused her death
thomas the fourth victim of the conspiracy is buried on the hill
with nina carrington five lives were sacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy
there will be two weddings before long and liddy has asked for my heliotrope poplin to wear to the church
i knew she would
she has wanted it for three years and she was quite ugly the time i spilled coffee on it
we are very quiet just the two of us
liddy still clings to her ghost theory and points to my wet and muddy boots in the trunkroom as proof
i am gray i admit but i havent felt as well in a dozen years
sometimes when i am bored i ring for liddy and we talk things over
when warner married rosie liddy sniffed and said what i took for faithfulness in rosie had been nothing but mawkishness
i have not yet outlived liddys contempt because i gave them silver knives and forks as a wedding gift
so we sit and talk and sometimes liddy threatens to leave and often i discharge her but we stay together somehow
i am talking of renting a house next year and liddy says to be sure there is no ghost
to be perfectly frank i never really lived until that summer
time has passed since i began this story
my neighbors are packing up for another summer
liddy is having the awnings put up and the window boxes filled
liddy or no liddy i shall advertise tomorrow for a house in the country and i dont care if it has a circular staircase
