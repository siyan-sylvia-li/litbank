chapter i  on the arizona hills   i am a very old man how old i do not know
possibly i am a hundred possibly more but i cannot tell because i have never aged as other men nor do i remember any childhood
so far as i can recollect i have always been a man a man of about thirty
i appear today as i did forty years and more ago and yet i feel that i cannot go on living forever that some day i shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection
i do not know why i should fear death i who have died twice and am still alive but yet i have the same horror of it as you who have never died and it is because of this terror of death i believe that i am so convinced of my mortality
and because of this conviction i have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death
i cannot explain the phenomena i can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an arizona cave
i have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after i have passed over for eternity
i know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp and so i do not purpose being pilloried by the public the pulpit and the press and held up as a colossal liar when i am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate
possibly the suggestions which i gained upon mars and the knowledge which i can set down in this chronicle will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet mysteries to you but no longer mysteries to me
my name is john carter i am better known as captain jack carter of virginia
at the close of the civil war i found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars confederate and a captain's commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the south
masterless penniless and with my only means of livelihood fighting gone i determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold
i spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another confederate officer captain james k powell of richmond
we were extremely fortunate for late in the winter of  after many hardships and privations we located the most remarkable goldbearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured
powell who was a mining engineer by education stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months
as our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine
as powell was familiar with the country as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip
it was agreed that i was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector
on march   powell and i packed his provisions on two of our burros and bidding me goodbye he mounted his horse and started down the mountainside toward the valley across which led the first stage of his journey
the morning of powell's departure was like nearly all arizona mornings clear and beautiful i could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley and all during the morning i would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau
my last sight of powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley
some half hour later i happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place i had last seen my friend and his two pack animals
i am not given to needless worrying but the more i tried to convince myself that all was well with powell and that the dots i had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses the less i was able to assure myself
since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile indian and we had therefore become careless in the extreme and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches
powell i knew was well armed and further an experienced indian fighter but i too had lived and fought for years among the sioux in the north and i knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing apaches
finally i could endure the suspense no longer and arming myself with my two colt revolvers and a carbine i strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse started down the trail taken by powell in the morning
as soon as i reached comparatively level ground i urged my mount into a canter and continued this where the going permitted until close upon dusk i discovered the point where other tracks joined those of powell
they were the tracks of unshod ponies three of them and the ponies had been galloping
i followed rapidly until darkness shutting down i was forced to await the rising of the moon and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase
possibly i had conjured up impossible dangers like some nervous old housewife and when i should catch up with powell would get a good laugh for my pains
however i am not prone to sensitiveness and the following of a sense of duty wherever it may lead has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings in whose service my sword has been red many a time
about nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and i had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk and in some places at a brisk trot until about midnight i reached the water hole where powell had expected to camp
i came upon the spot unexpectedly finding it entirely deserted with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp
i was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen for such i was now convinced they must be continued after powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water and always at the same rate of speed as his
i was positive now that the trailers were apaches and that they wished to capture powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture so i urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace hoping against hope that i would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him
further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me
i knew that powell would need me now if ever and i instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail
i had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small open plateau near the summit of the pass
i had passed through a narrow overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay
the little stretch of level land was white with indian tepees and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp
their attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me and i easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety
the fact however that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me
i do not believe that i am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes because in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death i cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that i took occurred to me until many hours later
my mind is evidently so constituted that i am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes
however that may be i have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me
in this instance i was of course positive that powell was the center of attraction but whether i thought or acted first i do not know but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view i had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors shooting rapidly and whooping at the top of my lungs
singlehanded i could not have pursued better tactics for the red men convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them turned and fled in every direction for their bows arrows and rifles
the view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage
under the clear rays of the arizona moon lay powell his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves
that he was already dead i could not but be convinced and yet i would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the apaches as quickly as i would have saved the man himself from death
riding close to him i reached down from the saddle and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount
a backward glance convinced me that to return by the way i had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau so putting spurs to my poor beast i made a dash for the opening to the pass which i could distinguish on the far side of the table land
the indians had by this time discovered that i was alone and i was pursued with imprecations arrows and rifle balls
the fact that it is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent and that i was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized
my horse was traveling practically unguided as i knew that i had probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass than he and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the summit of the range and not to the pass which i had hoped would carry me to the valley and to safety
it is probable however that to this fact i owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which befell me during the following ten years
my first knowledge that i was on the wrong trail came when i heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off to my left
i knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock formation at the edge of the plateau to the right of which my horse had borne me and the body of powell
i drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below and to my left and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing around the point of a neighboring peak
i knew the indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right direction as soon as they located my tracks
i had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff
the trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction i wished to go
the cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom of a rocky ravine
i had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave
the opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide and at this opening the trail ended
it was now morning and with the customary lack of dawn which is a startling characteristic of arizona it had become daylight almost without warning
dismounting i laid powell upon the ground but the most painstaking examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life
i forced water from my canteen between his dead lips bathed his face and rubbed his hands working over him continuously for the better part of an hour in the face of the fact that i knew him to be dead
i was very fond of powell he was thoroughly a man in every respect a polished southern gentleman a staunch and true friend and it was with a feeling of the deepest grief that i finally gave up my crude endeavors at resuscitation
leaving powell's body where it lay on the ledge i crept into the cave to reconnoiter
i found a large chamber possibly a hundred feet in diameter and thirty or forty feet in height a smooth and wellworn floor and many other evidences that the cave had at some remote period been inhabited
the back of the cave was so lost in dense shadow that i could not distinguish whether there were openings into other apartments or not
as i was continuing my examination i commenced to feel a pleasant drowsiness creeping over me which i attributed to the fatigue of my long and strenuous ride and the reaction from the excitement of the fight and the pursuit
i felt comparatively safe in my present location as i knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave against an army
i soon became so drowsy that i could scarcely resist the strong desire to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest but i knew that this would never do as it would mean certain death at the hands of my red friends who might be upon me at any moment
with an effort i started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly against a side wall and from there slip prone upon the floor
chapter ii  the escape of the dead   a sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me my muscles relaxed and i was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of approaching horses reached my ears
i attempted to spring to my feet but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my will
i was now thoroughly awake but as unable to move a muscle as though turned to stone
it was then for the first time that i noticed a slight vapor filling the cave
it was extremely tenuous and only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight
there also came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor and i could only assume that i had been overcome by some poisonous gas but why i should retain my mental faculties and yet be unable to move i could not fathom
i lay facing the opening of the cave and where i could see the short stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff around which the trail led
the noise of the approaching horses had ceased and i judged the indians were creeping stealthily upon me along the little ledge which led to my living tomb
i remember that i hoped they would make short work of me as i did not particularly relish the thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit prompted them
i had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their nearness and then a warbonneted paintstreaked face was thrust cautiously around the shoulder of the cliff and savage eyes looked into mine
that he could see me in the dim light of the cave i was sure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the opening
the fellow instead of approaching merely stood and stared his eyes bulging and his jaw dropped
and then another savage face appeared and a third and fourth and fifth craning their necks over the shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow ledge
each face was the picture of awe and fear but for what reason i did not know nor did i learn until ten years later
that there were still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them
suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of the cave behind me and as it reached the ears of the indians they turned and fled in terror panicstricken
so frantic were their efforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the braves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below
their wild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time and then all was still once more
the sound which had frightened them was not repeated but it had been sufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror which lurked in the shadows at my back
fear is a relative term and so i can only measure my feelings at that time by what i had experienced in previous positions of danger and by those that i have passed through since but i can say without shame that if the sensations i endured during the next few minutes were fear then may god help the coward for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment
to be held paralyzed with one's back toward some horrible and unknown danger from the very sound of which the ferocious apache warriors turn in wild stampede as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of wolves seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man who had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of a powerful physique
several times i thought i heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody moving cautiously but eventually even these ceased and i was left to the contemplation of my position without interruption
i could but vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis and my only hope lay in that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me
late in the afternoon my horse which had been standing with dragging rein before the cave started slowly down the trail evidently in search of food and water and i was left alone with my mysterious unknown companion and the dead body of my friend which lay just within my range of vision upon the ledge where i had placed it in the early morning
from then until possibly midnight all was silence the silence of the dead then suddenly the awful moan of the morning broke upon my startled ears and there came again from the black shadows the sound of a moving thing and a faint rustling as of dead leaves
the shock to my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme and with a superhuman effort i strove to break my awful bonds
it was an effort of the mind of the will of the nerves not muscular for i could not move even so much as my little finger but none the less mighty for all that
and then something gave there was a momentary feeling of nausea a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire and i stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown foe
and then the moonlight flooded the cave and there before me lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground
i looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then down at myself in utter bewilderment for there i lay clothed and yet here i stood but naked as at the minute of my birth
the transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis
my first thought was is this then death
have i indeed passed over forever into that other life
but i could not well believe this as i could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me
my breath was coming in quick short gasps cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that i was anything other than a wraith
again was i suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave
naked and unarmed as i was i had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me
my revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which for some unfathomable reason i could not bring myself to touch
my carbine was in its boot strapped to my saddle and as my horse had wandered off i was left without means of defense
my only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination to be creeping stealthily upon me
unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place i leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear arizona night
the crisp fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as an immediate tonic and i felt new life and new courage coursing through me
pausing upon the brink of the ledge i upbraided myself for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension
i reasoned with myself that i had lain helpless for many hours within the cave yet nothing had molested me and my better judgment when permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning convinced me that the noises i had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had caused the sounds i heard
i decided to investigate but first i lifted my head to fill my lungs with the pure invigorating night air of the mountains
as i did so i saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge and level cactistudded flat wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment
few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an arizona moonlit landscape the silvered mountains in the distance the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo and the grotesque details of the stiff yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world so different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth
as i stood thus meditating i turned my gaze from the landscape to the heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for the wonders of the earthly scene
my attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon
as i gazed upon it i felt a spell of overpowering fascinationit was mars the god of war and for me the fighting man it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment
as i gazed at it on that fargone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void to lure me to it to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron
my longing was beyond the power of opposition i closed my eyes stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space
there was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness
chapter iii  my advent on mars   i opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape
i knew that i was on mars not once did i question either my sanity or my wakefulness
i was not asleep no need for pinching here my inner consciousness told me as plainly that i was upon mars as your conscious mind tells you that you are upon earth
you do not question the fact neither did i  i found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish mosslike vegetation which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles
i seemed to be lying in a deep circular basin along the outer verge of which i could distinguish the irregularities of low hills
it was midday the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body yet no greater than would have been true under similar conditions on an arizona desert
here and there were slight outcroppings of quartzbearing rock which glistened in the sunlight and a little to my left perhaps a hundred yards appeared a low walled enclosure about four feet in height
no water and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence and as i was somewhat thirsty i determined to do a little exploring
springing to my feet i received my first martian surprise for the effort which on earth would have brought me standing upright carried me into the martian air to the height of about three yards
i alighted softly upon the ground however without appreciable shock or jar
now commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in the extreme
i found that i must learn to walk all over again as the muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon earth played strange antics with me upon mars
instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner my attempts to walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or back at the end of each second or third hop
my muscles perfectly attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on earth played the mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on mars
i was determined however to explore the low structure which was the only evidence of habitation in sight and so i hit upon the unique plan of reverting to first principles in locomotion creeping
i did fairly well at this and in a few moments had reached the low encircling wall of the enclosure
there appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me but as the wall was but about four feet high i cautiously gained my feet and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given me to see
the roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches in thickness and beneath this were several hundred large eggs perfectly round and snowy white
the eggs were nearly uniform in size being about two and onehalf feet in diameter
five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity
they seemed mostly head with little scrawny bodies long necks and six legs or as i afterward learned two legs and two arms with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms or legs
their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could be directed either forward or back and also independently of each other thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction or in two directions at once without the necessity of turning the head
the ears which were slightly above the eyes and closer together were small cupshaped antennae protruding not more than an inch on these young specimens
their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center of their faces midway between their mouths and ears
there was no hair on their bodies which were of a very light yellowishgreen color
in the adults as i was to learn quite soon this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in the female
further the heads of the adults are not so out of proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young
the iris of the eyes is blood red as in albinos while the pupil is dark
the eyeball itself is very white as are the teeth
these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located
the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china
against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner making these weapons present a singularly formidable appearance
most of these details i noted later for i was given but little time to speculate on the wonders of my new discovery
i had seen that the eggs were in the process of hatching and as i stood watching the hideous little monsters break from their shells i failed to note the approach of a score of fullgrown martians from behind me
coming as they did over the soft and soundless moss which covers practically the entire surface of mars with the exception of the frozen areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts they might have captured me easily but their intentions were far more sinister
it was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which warned me
on such a little thing my life hung that i often marvel that i escaped so easily
had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the butt of his great metalshod spear i should have snuffed out without ever knowing that death was near me
but the little sound caused me to turn and there upon me not ten feet from my breast was the point of that huge spear a spear forty feet long tipped with gleaming metal and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils i had been watching
but how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific incarnation of hate of vengeance and of death
the man himself for such i may call him was fully fifteen feet in height and on earth would have weighed some four hundred pounds
he sat his mount as we sit a horse grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs while the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side of his mount his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance
and his mount
how can earthly words describe it
it towered ten feet at the shoulder had four legs on either side a broad flat tail larger at the tip than at the root and which it held straight out behind while running a gaping mouth which split its head from its snout to its long massive neck
like its master it was entirely devoid of hair but was of a dark slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy
its belly was white and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet
the feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their approach and in common with a multiplicity of legs is a characteristic feature of the fauna of mars
the highest type of man and one other animal the only mammal existing on mars alone have wellformed nails and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there
behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others similar in all respects but as i learned later bearing individual characteristics peculiar to themselves precisely as no two of us are identical although we are all cast in a similar mold
this picture or rather materialized nightmare which i have described at length made but one terrible and swift impression on me as i turned to meet it
unarmed and naked as i was the first law of nature manifested itself in the only possible solution of my immediate problem and that was to get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear
consequently i gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap to reach the top of the martian incubator for such i had determined it must be
my effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it seemed to surprise the martian warriors for it carried me fully thirty feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on the opposite side of the enclosure
i alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall
some were surveying me with expressions which i afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that i had not molested their young
they were conversing together in low tones and gesticulating and pointing toward me
their discovery that i had not harmed the little martians and that i was unarmed must have caused them to look upon me with less ferocity but as i was to learn later the thing which weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling
while the martians are immense their bones are very large and they are muscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome
the result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful in proportion to their weight than an earth man and i doubt that were one of them suddenly to be transported to earth he could lift his own weight from the ground in fact i am convinced that he could not do so
my feat then was as marvelous upon mars as it would have been upon earth and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their fellows
the respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the appearance of the warriors for i could not disassociate these people in my mind from those other warriors who only the day before had been pursuing me
i noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to the huge spear which i have described
the weapon which caused me to decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a rifle of some description and which i felt for some reason they were peculiarly efficient in handling
these rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood which i learned later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on mars and entirely unknown to us denizens of earth
the metal of the barrel is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with which we are familiar
the weight of these rifles is comparatively little and with the small caliber explosive radium projectiles which they use and the great length of the barrel they are deadly in the extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on earth
the theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles but the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles
this is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the martian firearm and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of these deathdealing machines
the martians after conversing for a short time turned and rode away in the direction from which they had come leaving one of their number alone by the enclosure
when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the warrior by the enclosure
he was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me and was evidently the leader of the band as i had noted that they seemed to have moved to their present position at his direction
when his force had come to a halt he dismounted threw down his spear and small arms and came around the end of the incubator toward me entirely unarmed and as naked as i except for the ornaments strapped upon his head limbs and breast
when he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous metal armlet and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand addressed me in a clear resonant voice but in a language it is needless to say i could not understand
he then stopped as though waiting for my reply pricking up his antennaelike ears and cocking his strangelooking eyes still further toward me
as the silence became painful i concluded to hazard a little conversation on my own part as i had guessed that he was making overtures of peace
the throwing down of his weapons and the withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have signified a peaceful mission anywhere on earth so why not then on mars
placing my hand over my heart i bowed low to the martian and explained to him that while i did not understand his language his actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear to my heart
of course i might have been a babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him but he understood the action with which i immediately followed my words
stretching my hand toward him i advanced and took the armlet from his open palm clasping it about my arm above the elbow smiled at him and stood waiting
his wide mouth spread into an answering smile and locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back toward his mount
at the same time he motioned his followers to advance
they started toward us on a wild run but were checked by a signal from him
evidently he feared that were i to be really frightened again i might jump entirely out of the landscape
he exchanged a few words with his men motioned to me that i would ride behind one of them and then mounted his own animal
the fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount where i hung on as best i could by the belts and straps which held the martian's weapons and ornaments
the entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of hills in the distance
chapter iv  a prisoner   we had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very rapidly
we were as i was later to learn nearing the edge of one of mars' longdead seas in the bottom of which my encounter with the martians had taken place
in a short time we gained the foot of the mountains and after traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley at the far extremity of which was a low table land upon which i beheld an enormous city
toward this we galloped entering it by what appeared to be a ruined roadway leading out from the city but only to the edge of the table land where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps
upon closer observation i saw as we passed them that the buildings were deserted and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been tenanted for years possibly for ages
toward the center of the city was a large plaza and upon this and in the buildings immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred creatures of the same breed as my captors for such i now considered them despite the suave manner in which i had been trapped
with the exception of their ornaments all were naked
the women varied in appearance but little from the men except that their tusks were much larger in proportion to their height in some instances curving nearly to their highset ears
their bodies were smaller and lighter in color and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails which were entirely lacking among the males
the adult females ranged in height from ten to twelve feet
the children were light in color even lighter than the women and all looked precisely alike to me except that some were taller than others older i presumed
i saw no signs of extreme age among them nor is there any appreciable difference in their appearance from the age of maturity about forty until at about the age of one thousand years they go voluntarily upon their last strange pilgrimage down the river iss which leads no living martian knows whither and from whose bosom no martian has ever returned or would be allowed to live did he return after once embarking upon its cold dark waters
only about one martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease and possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage
the other nine hundred and seventynine die violent deaths in duels in hunting in aviation and in war but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes during the age of childhood when vast numbers of the little martians fall victims to the great white apes of mars
the average life expectancy of a martian after the age of maturity is about three hundred years but would be nearer the onethousand mark were it not for the various means leading to violent death
owing to the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in therapeutics and surgery produced and so human life has come to be considered but lightly on mars as is evidenced by their dangerous sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities
there are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of population but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact that no male or female martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of destruction
as we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck me from my seat behind my guard
a word from the leader of the party stilled their clamor and we proceeded at a trot across the plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has rested upon
the building was low but covered an enormous area
it was constructed of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight
the main entrance was some hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a huge canopy above the entrance hall
there was no stairway but a gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an enormous chamber encircled by galleries
on the floor of this chamber which was dotted with highly carved wooden desks and chairs were assembled about forty or fifty male martians around the steps of a rostrum
on the platform proper squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments gaycolored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings ingeniously set with precious stones
from his shoulders depended a short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk
what struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were entirely out of proportion to the desks chairs and other furnishings these being of a size adapted to human beings such as i whereas the great bulks of the martians could scarcely have squeezed into the chairs nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs
evidently then there were other denizens on mars than the wild and grotesque creatures into whose hands i had fallen but the evidences of extreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these buildings might have belonged to some longextinct and forgotten race in the dim antiquity of mars
our party had halted at the entrance to the building and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground
again locking his arm in mine we had proceeded into the audience chamber
there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain
my captor merely strode up to the rostrum the others making way for him as he advanced
the chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of my escort who in turn halted and repeated the name of the ruler followed by his title
at the time this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to me but later i came to know that this was the customary greeting between green martians
had the men been strangers and therefore unable to exchange names they would have silently exchanged ornaments had their missions been peacefulotherwise they would have exchanged shots or have fought out their introduction with some other of their various weapons
my captor whose name was tars tarkas was virtually the vicechieftain of the community and a man of great ability as a statesman and warrior
he evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with his expedition including my capture and when he had concluded the chieftain addressed me at some length
i replied in our good old english tongue merely to convince him that neither of us could understand the other but i noticed that when i smiled slightly on concluding he did likewise
this fact and the similar occurrence during my first talk with tars tarkas convinced me that we had at least something in common the ability to smile therefore to laugh denoting a sense of humor
but i was to learn that the martian smile is merely perfunctory and that the martian laugh is a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror
the ideas of humor among the green men of mars are widely at variance with our conceptions of incitants to merriment
the death agonies of a fellow being are to these strange creatures provocative of the wildest hilarity while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways
the assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely feeling my muscles and the texture of my skin
the principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform and motioning me to follow he started with tars tarkas for the open plaza
now i had made no attempt to walk since my first signal failure except while tightly grasping tars tarkas' arm and so now i went skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some monstrous grasshopper
after bruising myself severely much to the amusement of the martians i again had recourse to creeping but this did not suit them and i was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering fellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes
as he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and i did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of brutality boorishness and lack of consideration for a stranger's rights i swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a felled ox
as he sunk to the floor i wheeled around with my back toward the nearest desk expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance of his fellows but determined to give them as good a battle as the unequal odds would permit before i gave up my life
my fears were groundless however as the other martians at first struck dumb with wonderment finally broke into wild peals of laughter and applause
i did not recognize the applause as such but later when i had become acquainted with their customs i learned that i had won what they seldom accord a manifestation of approbation
the fellow whom i had struck lay where he had fallen nor did any of his mates approach him
tars tarkas advanced toward me holding out one of his arms and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further mishap
i did not of course know the reason for which we had come to the open but i was not long in being enlightened
they first repeated the word sak a number of times and then tars tarkas made several jumps repeating the same word before each leap then turning to me he said sak
i saw what they were after and gathering myself together i sakked with such marvelous success that i cleared a good hundred and fifty feet nor did i this time lose my equilibrium but landed squarely upon my feet without falling
i then returned by easy jumps of twentyfive or thirty feet to the little group of warriors
my exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser martians and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition which the chieftain then ordered me to make but i was both hungry and thirsty and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to demand the consideration from these creatures which they evidently would not voluntarily accord
i therefore ignored the repeated commands to sak and each time they were made i motioned to my mouth and rubbed my stomach
tars tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words and the former calling to a young female among the throng gave her some instructions and motioned me to accompany her
i grasped her proffered arm and together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side
my fair companion was about eight feet tall having just arrived at maturity but not yet to her full height
she was of a light olivegreen color with a smooth glossy hide
her name as i afterward learned was sola and she belonged to the retinue of tars tarkas
she conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildings fronting on the plaza and which from the litter of silks and furs upon the floor i took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the natives
the room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics but upon all there seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity which convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrous creations had nothing in common with the crude halfbrutes which now occupied them
sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of the room and turning made a peculiar hissing sound as though signaling to someone in an adjoining room
in response to her call i obtained my first sight of a new martian wonder
it waddled in on its ten short legs and squatted down before the girl like an obedient puppy
the thing was about the size of a shetland pony but its head bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog except that the jaws were equipped with three rows of long sharp tusks
chapter v  i elude my watch dog   sola stared into the brute's wickedlooking eyes muttered a word or two of command pointed to me and left the chamber
i could not but wonder what this ferociouslooking monstrosity might do when left alone in such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of meat but my fears were groundless as the beast after surveying me intently for a moment crossed the room to the only exit which led to the street and lay down full length across the threshold
this was my first experience with a martian watch dog but it was destined not to be my last for this fellow guarded me carefully during the time i remained a captive among these green men twice saving my life and never voluntarily being away from me a moment
while sola was away i took occasion to examine more minutely the room in which i found myself captive
the mural painting depicted scenes of rare and wonderful beauty mountains rivers lake ocean meadow trees and flowers winding roadways sunkissed gardensscenes which might have portrayed earthly views but for the different colorings of the vegetation
the work had evidently been wrought by a master hand so subtle the atmosphere so perfect the technique yet nowhere was there a representation of a living animal either human or brute by which i could guess at the likeness of these other and perhaps extinct denizens of mars
while i was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on the possible explanation of the strange anomalies which i had so far met with on mars sola returned bearing both food and drink
these she placed on the floor beside me and seating herself a short ways off regarded me intently
the food consisted of about a pound of some solid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless while the liquid was apparently milk from some animal
it was not unpleasant to the taste though slightly acid and i learned in a short time to prize it very highly
it came as i later discovered not from an animal as there is only one mammal on mars and that one very rare indeed but from a large plant which grows practically without water but seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products of the soil the moisture of the air and the rays of the sun
a single plant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day
after i had eaten i was greatly invigorated but feeling the need of rest i stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep
i must have slept several hours as it was dark when i awoke and i was very cold
i noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me but it had become partially dislodged and in the darkness i could not see to replace it
suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me shortly afterwards adding another to my covering
i presumed that my watchful guardian was sola nor was i wrong
this girl alone among all the green martians with whom i came in contact disclosed characteristics of sympathy kindliness and affection her ministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing and her solicitous care saved me from much suffering and many hardships
as i was to learn the martian nights are extremely cold and as there is practically no twilight or dawn the changes in temperature are sudden and most uncomfortable as are the transitions from brilliant daylight to darkness
the nights are either brilliantly illumined or very dark for if neither of the two moons of mars happen to be in the sky almost total darkness results since the lack of atmosphere or rather the very thin atmosphere fails to diffuse the starlight to any great extent on the other hand if both of the moons are in the heavens at night the surface of the ground is brightly illuminated
both of mars' moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to earth the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant while the further is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away against the nearly onequarter million miles which separate us from our moon
the nearer moon of mars makes a complete revolution around the planet in a little over seven and onehalf hours so that she may be seen hurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two or three times each night revealing all her phases during each transit of the heavens
the further moon revolves about mars in something over thirty and onequarter hours and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal martian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur
and it is well that nature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the martian night for the green men of mars being a nomadic race without high intellectual development have but crude means for artificial lighting depending principally upon torches a kind of candle and a peculiar oil lamp which generates a gas and burns without a wick
this last device produces an intensely brilliant farreaching white light but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained by mining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it is seldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today and whose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a semibarbaric state for countless ages
after sola had replenished my coverings i again slept nor did i awaken until daylight
the other occupants of the room five in number were all females and they were still sleeping piled high with a motley array of silks and furs
across the threshold lay stretched the sleepless guardian brute just as i had last seen him on the preceding day apparently he had not moved a muscle his eyes were fairly glued upon me and i fell to wondering just what might befall me should i endeavor to escape
i have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone
it therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exact attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room
i felt fairly secure in my belief that i could escape him should he pursue me once i was outside the building for i had begun to take great pride in my ability as a jumper
furthermore i could see from the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and probably no runner
slowly and carefully therefore i gained my feet only to see that my watcher did the same cautiously i advanced toward him finding that by moving with a shuffling gait i could retain my balance as well as make reasonably rapid progress
as i neared the brute he backed cautiously away from me and when i had reached the open he moved to one side to let me pass
he then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in my rear as i made my way along the deserted street
evidently his mission was to protect me only i thought but when we reached the edge of the city he suddenly sprang before me uttering strange sounds and baring his ugly and ferocious tusks
thinking to have some amusement at his expense i rushed toward him and when almost upon him sprang into the air alighting far beyond him and away from the city
he wheeled instantly and charged me with the most appalling speed i had ever beheld
i had thought his short legs a bar to swiftness but had he been coursing with greyhounds the latter would have appeared as though asleep on a door mat
as i was to learn this is the fleetest animal on mars and owing to its intelligence loyalty and ferocity is used in hunting in war and as the protector of the martian man
i quickly saw that i would have difficulty in escaping the fangs of the beast on a straightaway course and so i met his charge by doubling in my tracks and leaping over him as he was almost upon me
this maneuver gave me a considerable advantage and i was able to reach the city quite a bit ahead of him and as he came tearing after me i jumped for a window about thirty feet from the ground in the face of one of the buildings overlooking the valley
grasping the sill i pulled myself up to a sitting posture without looking into the building and gazed down at the baffled animal beneath me
my exultation was shortlived however for scarcely had i gained a secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped me by the neck from behind and dragged me violently into the room
here i was thrown upon my back and beheld standing over me a colossal apelike creature white and hairless except for an enormous shock of bristly hair upon its head
chapter vi  a fight that won friends   the thing which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did the martians i had seen held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behind me
this other which was evidently its mate soon came toward us bearing a mighty stone cudgel with which it evidently intended to brain me
the creatures were about ten or fifteen feet tall standing erect and had like the green martians an intermediary set of arms or legs midway between their upper and lower limbs
their eyes were close together and nonprotruding their ears were high set but more laterally located than those of the martians while their snouts and teeth were strikingly like those of our african gorilla
altogether they were not unlovely when viewed in comparison with the green martians
the cudgel was swinging in the arc which ended upon my upturned face when a bolt of myriadlegged horror hurled itself through the doorway full upon the breast of my executioner
with a shriek of fear the ape which held me leaped through the open window but its mate closed in a terrific death struggle with my preserver which was nothing less than my faithful watchthing i cannot bring myself to call so hideous a creature a dog
as quickly as possible i gained my feet and backing against the wall i witnessed such a battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see
the strength agility and blind ferocity of these two creatures is approached by nothing known to earthly man
my beast had an advantage in his first hold having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast of his adversary but the great arms and paws of the ape backed by muscles far transcending those of the martian men i had seen had locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life and bending back his head and neck upon his body where i momentarily expected the former to fall limp at the end of a broken neck
in accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of its breast which was held in the viselike grip of the powerful jaws
back and forth upon the floor they rolled neither one emitting a sound of fear or pain
presently i saw the great eyes of my beast bulging completely from their sockets and blood flowing from its nostrils
that he was weakening perceptibly was evident but so also was the ape whose struggles were growing momentarily less
suddenly i came to myself and with that strange instinct which seems ever to prompt me to my duty i seized the cudgel which had fallen to the floor at the commencement of the battle and swinging it with all the power of my earthly arms i crashed it full upon the head of the ape crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell
scarcely had the blow descended when i was confronted with a new danger
the ape's mate recovered from its first shock of terror had returned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior of the building
i glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway and the sight of him now roaring as he perceived his lifeless fellow stretched upon the floor and frothing at the mouth in the extremity of his rage filled me i must confess with dire forebodings
i am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not too overwhelmingly against me but in this instance i perceived neither glory nor profit in pitting my relatively puny strength against the iron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an unknown world in fact the only outcome of such an encounter so far as i might be concerned seemed sudden death
i was standing near the window and i knew that once in the street i might gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake me at least there was a chance for safety in flight against almost certain death should i remain and fight however desperately
it is true i held the cudgel but what could i do with it against his four great arms
even should i break one of them with my first blow for i figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel he could reach out and annihilate me with the others before i could recover for a second attack
in the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind i had turned to make for the window but my eyes alighting on the form of my erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds
he lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber his great eyes fastened upon me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection
i could not withstand that look nor could i on second thought have deserted my rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf as he had in mine
without more ado therefore i turned to meet the charge of the infuriated bull ape
he was now too close upon me for the cudgel to prove of any effective assistance so i merely threw it as heavily as i could at his advancing bulk
it struck him just below the knees eliciting a howl of pain and rage and so throwing him off his balance that he lunged full upon me with arms wide stretched to ease his fall
again as on the preceding day i had recourse to earthly tactics and swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin i followed it with a smashing left to the pit of his stomach
the effect was marvelous for as i lightly sidestepped after delivering the second blow he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain and gasping for wind
leaping over his prostrate body i seized the cudgel and finished the monster before he could regain his feet
as i delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me and turning i beheld tars tarkas sola and three or four warriors standing in the doorway of the chamber
as my eyes met theirs i was for the second time the recipient of their zealously guarded applause
my absence had been noted by sola on her awakening and she had quickly informed tars tarkas who had set out immediately with a handful of warriors to search for me
as they had approached the limits of the city they had witnessed the actions of the bull ape as he bolted into the building frothing with rage
they had followed immediately behind him thinking it barely possible that his actions might prove a clew to my whereabouts and had witnessed my short but decisive battle with him
this encounter together with my setto with the martian warrior on the previous day and my feats of jumping placed me upon a high pinnacle in their regard
evidently devoid of all the finer sentiments of friendship love or affection these people fairly worship physical prowess and bravery and nothing is too good for the object of their adoration as long as he maintains his position by repeated examples of his skill strength and courage
sola who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition was the only one of the martians whose face had not been twisted in laughter as i battled for my life
she on the contrary was sober with apparent solicitude and as soon as i had finished the monster rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds or injuries
satisfying herself that i had come off unscathed she smiled quietly and taking my hand started toward the door of the chamber
tars tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing over the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life and whose life i in turn had rescued
they seemed to be deep in argument and finally one of them addressed me but remembering my ignorance of his language turned back to tars tarkas who with a word and gesture gave some command to the fellow and turned to follow us from the room
there seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast and i hesitated to leave until i had learned the outcome
it was well i did so for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its holster and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when i sprang forward and struck up his arm
the bullet striking the wooden casing of the window exploded blowing a hole completely through the wood and masonry
i then knelt down beside the fearsomelooking thing and raising it to its feet motioned for it to follow me
the looks of surprise which my actions elicited from the martians were ludicrous they could not understand except in a feeble and childish way such attributes as gratitude and compassion
the warrior whose gun i had struck up looked enquiringly at tars tarkas but the latter signed that i be left to my own devices and so we returned to the plaza with my great beast following close at heel and sola grasping me tightly by the arm
i had at least two friends on mars a young woman who watched over me with motherly solicitude and a dumb brute which as i later came to know held in its poor ugly carcass more love more loyalty more gratitude than could have been found in the entire five million green martians who rove the deserted cities and dead sea bottoms of mars
chapter vii  childraising on mars   after a breakfast which was an exact replica of the meal of the preceding day and an index of practically every meal which followed while i was with the green men of mars sola escorted me to the plaza where i found the entire community engaged in watching or helping at the harnessing of huge mastodonian animals to great threewheeled chariots
there were about two hundred and fifty of these vehicles each drawn by a single animal any one of which from their appearance might easily have drawn the entire wagon train when fully loaded
the chariots themselves were large commodious and gorgeously decorated
in each was seated a female martian loaded with ornaments of metal with jewels and silks and furs and upon the back of each of the beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young martian driver
like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted the heavier draft animals wore neither bit nor bridle but were guided entirely by telepathic means
this power is wonderfully developed in all martians and accounts largely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively few spoken words exchanged even in long conversations
it is the universal language of mars through the medium of which the higher and lower animals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greater or less extent depending upon the intellectual sphere of the species and the development of the individual
as the cavalcade took up the line of march in single file sola dragged me into an empty chariot and we proceeded with the procession toward the point by which i had entered the city the day before
at the head of the caravan rode some two hundred warriors five abreast and a like number brought up the rear while twentyfive or thirty outriders flanked us on either side
every one but myselfmen women and childrenwere heavily armed and at the tail of each chariot trotted a martian hound my own beast following closely behind ours in fact the faithful creature never left me voluntarily during the entire ten years i spent on mars
our way led out across the little valley before the city through the hills and down into the dead sea bottom which i had traversed on my journey from the incubator to the plaza
the incubator as it proved was the terminal point of our journey this day and as the entire cavalcade broke into a mad gallop as soon as we reached the level expanse of sea bottom we were soon within sight of our goal
on reaching it the chariots were parked with military precision on the four sides of the enclosure and half a score of warriors headed by the enormous chieftain and including tars tarkas and several other lesser chiefs dismounted and advanced toward it
i could see tars tarkas explaining something to the principal chieftain whose name by the way was as nearly as i can translate it into english lorquas ptomel jed jed being his title
i was soon appraised of the subject of their conversation as calling to sola tars tarkas signed for her to send me to him
i had by this time mastered the intricacies of walking under martian conditions and quickly responding to his command i advanced to the side of the incubator where the warriors stood
as i reached their side a glance showed me that all but a very few eggs had hatched the incubator being fairly alive with the hideous little devils
they ranged in height from three to four feet and were moving restlessly about the enclosure as though searching for food
as i came to a halt before him tars tarkas pointed over the incubator and said sak
i saw that he wanted me to repeat my performance of yesterday for the edification of lorquas ptomel and as i must confess that my prowess gave me no little satisfaction i responded quickly leaping entirely over the parked chariots on the far side of the incubator
as i returned lorquas ptomel grunted something at me and turning to his warriors gave a few words of command relative to the incubator
they paid no further attention to me and i was thus permitted to remain close and watch their operations which consisted in breaking an opening in the wall of the incubator large enough to permit of the exit of the young martians
on either side of this opening the women and the younger martians both male and female formed two solid walls leading out through the chariots and quite away into the plain beyond
between these walls the little martians scampered wild as deer being permitted to run the full length of the aisle where they were captured one at a time by the women and older children the last in the line capturing the first little one to reach the end of the gauntlet her opposite in the line capturing the second and so on until all the little fellows had left the enclosure and been appropriated by some youth or female
as the women caught the young they fell out of line and returned to their respective chariots while those who fell into the hands of the young men were later turned over to some of the women
i saw that the ceremony if it could be dignified by such a name was over and seeking out sola i found her in our chariot with a hideous little creature held tightly in her arms
the work of rearing young green martians consists solely in teaching them to talk and to use the weapons of warfare with which they are loaded down from the very first year of their lives
coming from eggs in which they have lain for five years the period of incubation they step forth into the world perfectly developed except in size
entirely unknown to their mothers who in turn would have difficulty in pointing out the fathers with any degree of accuracy they are the common children of the community and their education devolves upon the females who chance to capture them as they leave the incubator
their foster mothers may not even have had an egg in the incubator as was the case with sola who had not commenced to lay until less than a year before she became the mother of another woman's offspring
but this counts for little among the green martians as parental and filial love is as unknown to them as it is common among us
i believe this horrible system which has been carried on for ages is the direct cause of the loss of all the finer feelings and higher humanitarian instincts among these poor creatures
from birth they know no father or mother love they know not the meaning of the word home they are taught that they are only suffered to live until they can demonstrate by their physique and ferocity that they are fit to live
should they prove deformed or defective in any way they are promptly shot nor do they see a tear shed for a single one of the many cruel hardships they pass through from earliest infancy
i do not mean that the adult martians are unnecessarily or intentionally cruel to the young but theirs is a hard and pitiless struggle for existence upon a dying planet the natural resources of which have dwindled to a point where the support of each additional life means an added tax upon the community into which it is thrown
by careful selection they rear only the hardiest specimens of each species and with almost supernatural foresight they regulate the birth rate to merely offset the loss by death
each adult martian female brings forth about thirteen eggs each year and those which meet the size weight and specific gravity tests are hidden in the recesses of some subterranean vault where the temperature is too low for incubation
every year these eggs are carefully examined by a council of twenty chieftains and all but about one hundred of the most perfect are destroyed out of each yearly supply
at the end of five years about five hundred almost perfect eggs have been chosen from the thousands brought forth
these are then placed in the almost airtight incubators to be hatched by the sun's rays after a period of another five years
the hatching which we had witnessed today was a fairly representative event of its kind all but about one per cent of the eggs hatching in two days
if the remaining eggs ever hatched we knew nothing of the fate of the little martians
they were not wanted as their offspring might inherit and transmit the tendency to prolonged incubation and thus upset the system which has maintained for ages and which permits the adult martians to figure the proper time for return to the incubators almost to an hour
the incubators are built in remote fastnesses where there is little or no likelihood of their being discovered by other tribes
the result of such a catastrophe would mean no children in the community for another five years
i was later to witness the results of the discovery of an alien incubator
the community of which the green martians with whom my lot was cast formed a part was composed of some thirty thousand souls
they roamed an enormous tract of arid and semiarid land between forty and eighty degrees south latitude and bounded on the east and west by two large fertile tracts
their headquarters lay in the southwest corner of this district near the crossing of two of the socalled martian canals
as the incubator had been placed far north of their own territory in a supposedly uninhabited and unfrequented area we had before us a tremendous journey concerning which i of course knew nothing
after our return to the dead city i passed several days in comparative idleness
on the day following our return all the warriors had ridden forth early in the morning and had not returned until just before darkness fell
as i later learned they had been to the subterranean vaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to the incubator which they had then walled up for another five years and which in all probability would not be visited again during that period
the vaults which hid the eggs until they were ready for the incubator were located many miles south of the incubator and would be visited yearly by the council of twenty chieftains
why they did not arrange to build their vaults and incubators nearer home has always been a mystery to me and like many other martian mysteries unsolved and unsolvable by earthly reasoning and customs
sola's duties were now doubled as she was compelled to care for the young martian as well as for me but neither one of us required much attention and as we were both about equally advanced in martian education sola took it upon herself to train us together
her prize consisted in a male about four feet tall very strong and physically perfect also he learned quickly and we had considerable amusement at least i did over the keen rivalry we displayed
the martian language as i have said is extremely simple and in a week i could make all my wants known and understand nearly everything that was said to me
likewise under sola's tutelage i developed my telepathic powers so that i shortly could sense practically everything that went on around me
what surprised sola most in me was that while i could catch telepathic messages easily from others and often when they were not intended for me no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances
at first this vexed me but later i was very glad of it as it gave me an undoubted advantage over the martians
chapter viii  a fair captive from the sky   the third day after the incubator ceremony we set forth toward home but scarcely had the head of the procession debouched into the open ground before the city than orders were given for an immediate and hasty return
as though trained for years in this particular evolution the green martians melted like mist into the spacious doorways of the nearby buildings until in less than three minutes the entire cavalcade of chariots mastodons and mounted warriors was nowhere to be seen
sola and i had entered a building upon the front of the city in fact the same one in which i had had my encounter with the apes and wishing to see what had caused the sudden retreat i mounted to an upper floor and peered from the window out over the valley and the hills beyond and there i saw the cause of their sudden scurrying to cover
a huge craft long low and graypainted swung slowly over the crest of the nearest hill
following it came another and another and another until twenty of them swinging low above the ground sailed slowly and majestically toward us
each carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upper works and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device that gleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance at which we were from the vessels
i could see figures crowding the forward decks and upper works of the air craft
whether they had discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city i could not say but in any event they received a rude reception for suddenly and without warning the green martian warriors fired a terrific volley from the windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which the great ships were so peacefully advancing
instantly the scene changed as by magic the foremost vessel swung broadside toward us and bringing her guns into play returned our fire at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short distance and then turning back with the evident intention of completing a great circle which would bring her up to position once more opposite our firing line the other vessels followed in her wake each one opening upon us as she swung into position
our own fire never diminished and i doubt if twentyfive per cent of our shots went wild
it had never been given me to see such deadly accuracy of aim and it seemed as though a little figure on one of the craft dropped at the explosion of each bullet while the banners and upper works dissolved in spurts of flame as the irresistible projectiles of our warriors mowed through them
the fire from the vessels was most ineffectual owing as i afterward learned to the unexpected suddenness of the first volley which caught the ship's crews entirely unprepared and the sighting apparatus of the guns unprotected from the deadly aim of our warriors
it seems that each green warrior has certain objective points for his fire under relatively identical circumstances of warfare
for example a proportion of them always the best marksmen direct their fire entirely upon the wireless finding and sighting apparatus of the big guns of an attacking naval force another detail attends to the smaller guns in the same way others pick off the gunners still others the officers while certain other quotas concentrate their attention upon the other members of the crew upon the upper works and upon the steering gear and propellers
twenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailing off in the direction from which it had first appeared
several of the craft were limping perceptibly and seemed but barely under the control of their depleted crews
their fire had ceased entirely and all their energies seemed focused upon escape
our warriors then rushed up to the roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed the retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire
one by one however the ships managed to dip below the crests of the outlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight
this had received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks
slowly she swung from her course circling back toward us in an erratic and pitiful manner
instantly the warriors ceased firing for it was quite apparent that the vessel was entirely helpless and far from being in a position to inflict harm upon us she could not even control herself sufficiently to escape
as she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meet her but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope to reach her decks
from my vantage point in the window i could see the bodies of her crew strewn about although i could not make out what manner of creatures they might be
not a sign of life was manifest upon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterly direction
she was drifting some fifty feet above the ground followed by all but some hundred of the warriors who had been ordered back to the roofs to cover the possibility of a return of the fleet or of reinforcements
it soon became evident that she would strike the face of the buildings about a mile south of our position and as i watched the progress of the chase i saw a number of warriors gallop ahead dismount and enter the building she seemed destined to touch
as the craft neared the building and just before she struck the martian warriors swarmed upon her from the windows and with their great spears eased the shock of the collision and in a few moments they had thrown out grappling hooks and the big boat was being hauled to ground by their fellows below
after making her fast they swarmed the sides and searched the vessel from stem to stern
i could see them examining the dead sailors evidently for signs of life and presently a party of them appeared from below dragging a little figure among them
the creature was considerably less than half as tall as the green martian warriors and from my balcony i could see that it walked erect upon two legs and surmised that it was some new and strange martian monstrosity with which i had not as yet become acquainted
they removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced a systematic rifling of the vessel
this operation required several hours during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned to transport the loot which consisted in arms ammunition silks furs jewels strangely carved stone vessels and a quantity of solid foods and liquids including many casks of water the first i had seen since my advent upon mars
after the last load had been removed the warriors made lines fast to the craft and towed her far out into the valley in a southwesterly direction
a few of them then boarded her and were busily engaged in what appeared from my distant position as the emptying of the contents of various carboys upon the dead bodies of the sailors and over the decks and works of the vessel
this operation concluded they hastily clambered over her sides sliding down the guy ropes to the ground
the last warrior to leave the deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel waiting an instant to note the outcome of his act
as a faint spurt of flame rose from the point where the missile struck he swung over the side and was quickly upon the ground
scarcely had he alighted than the guy ropes were simultaneously released and the great warship lightened by the removal of the loot soared majestically into the air her decks and upper works a mass of roaring flames
slowly she drifted to the southeast rising higher and higher as the flames ate away her wooden parts and diminished the weight upon her
ascending to the roof of the building i watched her for hours until finally she was lost in the dim vistas of the distance
the sight was aweinspiring in the extreme as one contemplated this mighty floating funeral pyre drifting unguided and unmanned through the lonely wastes of the martian heavens a derelict of death and destruction typifying the life story of these strange and ferocious creatures into whose unfriendly hands fate had carried it
much depressed and to me unaccountably so i slowly descended to the street
the scene i had witnessed seemed to mark the defeat and annihilation of the forces of a kindred people rather than the routing by our green warriors of a horde of similar though unfriendly creatures
i could not fathom the seeming hallucination nor could i free myself from it but somewhere in the innermost recesses of my soul i felt a strange yearning toward these unknown foemen and a mighty hope surged through me that the fleet would return and demand a reckoning from the green warriors who had so ruthlessly and wantonly attacked it
close at my heel in his now accustomed place followed woola the hound and as i emerged upon the street sola rushed up to me as though i had been the object of some search on her part
the cavalcade was returning to the plaza the homeward march having been given up for that day nor in fact was it recommenced for more than a week owing to the fear of a return attack by the air craft
lorquas ptomel was too astute an old warrior to be caught upon the open plains with a caravan of chariots and children and so we remained at the deserted city until the danger seemed passed
as sola and i entered the plaza a sight met my eyes which filled my whole being with a great surge of mingled hope fear exultation and depression and yet most dominant was a subtle sense of relief and happiness for just as we neared the throng of martians i caught a glimpse of the prisoner from the battle craft who was being roughly dragged into a nearby building by a couple of green martian females
and the sight which met my eyes was that of a slender girlish figure similar in every detail to the earthly women of my past life
she did not see me at first but just as she was disappearing through the portal of the building which was to be her prison she turned and her eyes met mine
her face was oval and beautiful in the extreme her every feature was finely chiseled and exquisite her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black waving hair caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure
her skin was of a light reddish copper color against which the crimson glow of her cheeks and the ruby of her beautifully molded lips shone with a strangely enhancing effect
she was as destitute of clothes as the green martians who accompanied her indeed save for her highly wrought ornaments she was entirely naked nor could any apparel have enhanced the beauty of her perfect and symmetrical figure
as her gaze rested on me her eyes opened wide in astonishment and she made a little sign with her free hand a sign which i did not of course understand
just a moment we gazed upon each other and then the look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified her face as she discovered me faded into one of utter dejection mingled with loathing and contempt
i realized i had not answered her signal and ignorant as i was of martian customs i intuitively felt that she had made an appeal for succor and protection which my unfortunate ignorance had prevented me from answering
and then she was dragged out of my sight into the depths of the deserted edifice
chapter ix  i learn the language   as i came back to myself i glanced at sola who had witnessed this encounter and i was surprised to note a strange expression upon her usually expressionless countenance
what her thoughts were i did not know for as yet i had learned but little of the martian tongue enough only to suffice for my daily needs
as i reached the doorway of our building a strange surprise awaited me
a warrior approached bearing the arms ornaments and full accouterments of his kind
these he presented to me with a few unintelligible words and a bearing at once respectful and menacing
later sola with the aid of several of the other women remodeled the trappings to fit my lesser proportions and after they completed the work i went about garbed in all the panoply of war
from then on sola instructed me in the mysteries of the various weapons and with the martian young i spent several hours each day practicing upon the plaza
i was not yet proficient with all the weapons but my great familiarity with similar earthly weapons made me an unusually apt pupil and i progressed in a very satisfactory manner
the training of myself and the young martians was conducted solely by the women who not only attend to the education of the young in the arts of individual defense and offense but are also the artisans who produce every manufactured article wrought by the green martians
they make the powder the cartridges the firearms in fact everything of value is produced by the females
in time of actual warfare they form a part of the reserves and when the necessity arises fight with even greater intelligence and ferocity than the men
the men are trained in the higher branches of the art of war in strategy and the maneuvering of large bodies of troops
they make the laws as they are needed a new law for each emergency
they are unfettered by precedent in the administration of justice
customs have been handed down by ages of repetition but the punishment for ignoring a custom is a matter for individual treatment by a jury of the culprit's peers and i may say that justice seldom misses fire but seems rather to rule in inverse ratio to the ascendency of law
in one respect at least the martians are a happy people they have no lawyers
i did not see the prisoner again for several days subsequent to our first encounter and then only to catch a fleeting glimpse of her as she was being conducted to the great audience chamber where i had had my first meeting with lorquas ptomel
i could not but note the unnecessary harshness and brutality with which her guards treated her so different from the almost maternal kindliness which sola manifested toward me and the respectful attitude of the few green martians who took the trouble to notice me at all
i had observed on the two occasions when i had seen her that the prisoner exchanged words with her guards and this convinced me that they spoke or at least could make themselves understood by a common language
with this added incentive i nearly drove sola distracted by my importunities to hasten on my education and within a few more days i had mastered the martian tongue sufficiently well to enable me to carry on a passable conversation and to fully understand practically all that i heard
at this time our sleeping quarters were occupied by three or four females and a couple of the recently hatched young beside sola and her youthful ward myself and woola the hound
after they had retired for the night it was customary for the adults to carry on a desultory conversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep and now that i could understand their language i was always a keen listener although i never proffered any remarks myself
on the night following the prisoner's visit to the audience chamber the conversation finally fell upon this subject and i was all ears on the instant
i had feared to question sola relative to the beautiful captive as i could not but recall the strange expression i had noted upon her face after my first encounter with the prisoner
that it denoted jealousy i could not say and yet judging all things by mundane standards as i still did i felt it safer to affect indifference in the matter until i learned more surely sola's attitude toward the object of my solicitude
sarkoja one of the older women who shared our domicile had been present at the audience as one of the captive's guards and it was toward her the question turned
when asked one of the women will we enjoy the death throes of the red one
or does lorquas ptomel jed intend holding her for ransom
they have decided to carry her with us back to thark and exhibit her last agonies at the great games before tal hajus replied sarkoja
what will be the manner of her going out
inquired sola
she is very small and very beautiful i had hoped that they would hold her for ransom
sarkoja and the other women grunted angrily at this evidence of weakness on the part of sola
it is sad sola that you were not born a million years ago snapped sarkoja when all the hollows of the land were filled with water and the peoples were as soft as the stuff they sailed upon
in our day we have progressed to a point where such sentiments mark weakness and atavism
it will not be well for you to permit tars tarkas to learn that you hold such degenerate sentiments as i doubt that he would care to entrust such as you with the grave responsibilities of maternity
i see nothing wrong with my expression of interest in this red woman retorted sola
she has never harmed us nor would she should we have fallen into her hands
it is only the men of her kind who war upon us and i have ever thought that their attitude toward us is but the reflection of ours toward them
they live at peace with all their fellows except when duty calls upon them to make war while we are at peace with none forever warring among our own kind as well as upon the red men and even in our own communities the individuals fight amongst themselves
oh it is one continual awful period of bloodshed from the time we break the shell until we gladly embrace the bosom of the river of mystery the dark and ancient iss which carries us to an unknown but at least no more frightful and terrible existence
fortunate indeed is he who meets his end in an early death
say what you please to tars tarkas he can mete out no worse fate to me than a continuation of the horrible existence we are forced to lead in this life
this wild outbreak on the part of sola so greatly surprised and shocked the other women that after a few words of general reprimand they all lapsed into silence and were soon asleep
one thing the episode had accomplished was to assure me of sola's friendliness toward the poor girl and also to convince me that i had been extremely fortunate in falling into her hands rather than those of some of the other females
i knew that she was fond of me and now that i had discovered that she hated cruelty and barbarity i was confident that i could depend upon her to aid me and the girl captive to escape provided of course that such a thing was within the range of possibilities
i did not even know that there were any better conditions to escape to but i was more than willing to take my chances among people fashioned after my own mold rather than to remain longer among the hideous and bloodthirsty green men of mars
but where to go and how was as much of a puzzle to me as the ageold search for the spring of eternal life has been to earthly men since the beginning of time
i decided that at the first opportunity i would take sola into my confidence and openly ask her to aid me and with this resolution strong upon me i turned among my silks and furs and slept the dreamless and refreshing sleep of mars
chapter x  champion and chief   early the next morning i was astir
considerable freedom was allowed me as sola had informed me that so long as i did not attempt to leave the city i was free to go and come as i pleased
she had warned me however against venturing forth unarmed as this city like all other deserted metropolises of an ancient martian civilization was peopled by the great white apes of my second day's adventure
in advising me that i must not leave the boundaries of the city sola had explained that woola would prevent this anyway should i attempt it and she warned me most urgently not to arouse his fierce nature by ignoring his warnings should i venture too close to the forbidden territory
his nature was such she said that he would bring me back into the city dead or alive should i persist in opposing him preferably dead she added
on this morning i had chosen a new street to explore when suddenly i found myself at the limits of the city
before me were low hills pierced by narrow and inviting ravines
i longed to explore the country before me and like the pioneer stock from which i sprang to view what the landscape beyond the encircling hills might disclose from the summits which shut out my view
it also occurred to me that this would prove an excellent opportunity to test the qualities of woola
i was convinced that the brute loved me i had seen more evidences of affection in him than in any other martian animal man or beast and i was sure that gratitude for the acts that had twice saved his life would more than outweigh his loyalty to the duty imposed upon him by cruel and loveless masters
as i approached the boundary line woola ran anxiously before me and thrust his body against my legs
his expression was pleading rather than ferocious nor did he bare his great tusks or utter his fearful guttural warnings
denied the friendship and companionship of my kind i had developed considerable affection for woola and sola for the normal earthly man must have some outlet for his natural affections and so i decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute sure that i would not be disappointed
i had never petted nor fondled him but now i sat upon the ground and putting my arms around his heavy neck i stroked and coaxed him talking in my newly acquired martian tongue as i would have to my hound at home as i would have talked to any other friend among the lower animals
his response to my manifestation of affection was remarkable to a degree he stretched his great mouth to its full width baring the entire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and wrinkling his snout until his great eyes were almost hidden by the folds of flesh
if you have ever seen a collie smile you may have some idea of woola's facial distortion
he threw himself upon his back and fairly wallowed at my feet jumped up and sprang upon me rolling me upon the ground by his great weight then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy presenting its back for the petting it craves
i could not resist the ludicrousness of the spectacle and holding my sides i rocked back and forth in the first laughter which had passed my lips in many days the first in fact since the morning powell had left camp when his horse long unused had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him off headforemost into a pot of frijoles
my laughter frightened woola his antics ceased and he crawled pitifully toward me poking his ugly head far into my lap and then i remembered what laughter signified on marstorture suffering death
quieting myself i rubbed the poor old fellow's head and back talked to him for a few minutes and then in an authoritative tone commanded him to follow me and arising started for the hills
there was no further question of authority between us woola was my devoted slave from that moment hence and i his only and undisputed master
my walk to the hills occupied but a few minutes and i found nothing of particular interest to reward me
numerous brilliantly colored and strangely formed wild flowers dotted the ravines and from the summit of the first hill i saw still other hills stretching off toward the north and rising one range above another until lost in mountains of quite respectable dimensions though i afterward found that only a few peaks on all mars exceed four thousand feet in height the suggestion of magnitude was merely relative
my morning's walk had been large with importance to me for it had resulted in a perfect understanding with woola upon whom tars tarkas relied for my safe keeping
i now knew that while theoretically a prisoner i was virtually free and i hastened to regain the city limits before the defection of woola could be discovered by his erstwhile masters
the adventure decided me never again to leave the limits of my prescribed stamping grounds until i was ready to venture forth for good and all as it would certainly result in a curtailment of my liberties as well as the probable death of woola were we to be discovered
on regaining the plaza i had my third glimpse of the captive girl
she was standing with her guards before the entrance to the audience chamber and as i approached she gave me one haughty glance and turned her back full upon me
the act was so womanly so earthly womanly that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with a feeling of companionship it was good to know that someone else on mars beside myself had human instincts of a civilized order even though the manifestation of them was so painful and mortifying
had a green martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt she would in all likelihood have done it with a sword thrust or a movement of her trigger finger but as their sentiments are mostly atrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused such passions in them
sola let me add was an exception i never saw her perform a cruel or uncouth act or fail in uniform kindliness and good nature
she was indeed as her fellow martian had said of her an atavism a dear and precious reversion to a former type of loved and loving ancestor
seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction i halted to view the proceedings
i had not long to wait for presently lorquas ptomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audience chamber
realizing that i was a somewhat favored character and also convinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in their language as i had plead with sola to keep this a secret on the grounds that i did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until i had perfectly mastered the martian tongue i chanced an attempt to enter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings
the council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum while below them stood the prisoner and her two guards
i saw that one of the women was sarkoja and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of the preceding day the results of which she had reported to the occupants of our dormitory last night
her attitude toward the captive was most harsh and brutal
when she held her she sunk her rudimentary nails into the poor girl's flesh or twisted her arm in a most painful manner
when it was necessary to move from one spot to another she either jerked her roughly or pushed her headlong before her
she seemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all the hatred cruelty ferocity and spite of her nine hundred years backed by unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors
the other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent if the prisoner had been left to her alone and fortunately she was at night she would have received no harsh treatment nor by the same token would she have received any attention at all
as lorquas ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell on me and he turned to tars tarkas with a word and gesture of impatience
tars tarkas made some reply which i could not catch but which caused lorquas ptomel to smile after which they paid no further attention to me
what is your name
asked lorquas ptomel addressing the prisoner
dejah thoris daughter of mors kajak of helium
and the nature of your expedition
he continued
it was a purely scientific research party sent out by my father's father the jeddak of helium to rechart the air currents and to take atmospheric density tests replied the fair prisoner in a low wellmodulated voice
we were unprepared for battle she continued as we were on a peaceful mission as our banners and the colors of our craft denoted
the work we were doing was as much in your interests as in ours for you know full well that were it not for our labors and the fruits of our scientific operations there would not be enough air or water on mars to support a single human life
for ages we have maintained the air and water supply at practically the same point without an appreciable loss and we have done this in the face of the brutal and ignorant interference of you green men
why oh why will you not learn to live in amity with your fellows
must you ever go on down the ages to your final extinction but little above the plane of the dumb brutes that serve you
a people without written language without art without homes without love the victims of eons of the horrible community idea
owning everything in common even to your women and children has resulted in your owning nothing in common
you hate each other as you hate all else except yourselves
come back to the ways of our common ancestors come back to the light of kindliness and fellowship
the way is open to you you will find the hands of the red men stretched out to aid you
together we may do still more to regenerate our dying planet
the granddaughter of the greatest and mightiest of the red jeddaks has asked you
will you come
lorquas ptomel and the warriors sat looking silently and intently at the young woman for several moments after she had ceased speaking
what was passing in their minds no man may know but that they were moved i truly believe and if one man high among them had been strong enough to rise above custom that moment would have marked a new and mighty era for mars
i saw tars tarkas rise to speak and on his face was such an expression as i had never seen upon the countenance of a green martian warrior
it bespoke an inward and mighty battle with self with heredity with ageold custom and as he opened his mouth to speak a look almost of benignity of kindliness momentarily lighted up his fierce and terrible countenance
what words of moment were to have fallen from his lips were never spoken as just then a young warrior evidently sensing the trend of thought among the older men leaped down from the steps of the rostrum and striking the frail captive a powerful blow across the face which felled her to the floor placed his foot upon her prostrate form and turning toward the assembled council broke into peals of horrid mirthless laughter
for an instant i thought tars tarkas would strike him dead nor did the aspect of lorquas ptomel augur any too favorably for the brute but the mood passed their old selves reasserted their ascendency and they smiled
it was portentous however that they did not laugh aloud for the brute's act constituted a sidesplitting witticism according to the ethics which rule green martian humor
that i have taken moments to write down a part of what occurred as that blow fell does not signify that i remained inactive for any such length of time
i think i must have sensed something of what was coming for i realize now that i was crouched as for a spring as i saw the blow aimed at her beautiful upturned pleading face and ere the hand descended i was halfway across the hall
scarcely had his hideous laugh rang out but once when i was upon him
the brute was twelve feet in height and armed to the teeth but i believe that i could have accounted for the whole roomful in the terrific intensity of my rage
springing upward i struck him full in the face as he turned at my warning cry and then as he drew his shortsword i drew mine and sprang up again upon his breast hooking one leg over the butt of his pistol and grasping one of his huge tusks with my left hand while i delivered blow after blow upon his enormous chest
he could not use his shortsword to advantage because i was too close to him nor could he draw his pistol which he attempted to do in direct opposition to martian custom which says that you may not fight a fellow warrior in private combat with any other than the weapon with which you are attacked
in fact he could do nothing but make a wild and futile attempt to dislodge me
with all his immense bulk he was little if any stronger than i and it was but the matter of a moment or two before he sank bleeding and lifeless to the floor
dejah thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching the battle with wide staring eyes
when i had regained my feet i raised her in my arms and bore her to one of the benches at the side of the room
again no martian interfered with me and tearing a piece of silk from my cape i endeavored to staunch the flow of blood from her nostrils
i was soon successful as her injuries amounted to little more than an ordinary nosebleed and when she could speak she placed her hand upon my arm and looking up into my eyes said  why did you do it
you who refused me even friendly recognition in the first hour of my peril
and now you risk your life and kill one of your companions for my sake
i cannot understand
what strange manner of man are you that you consort with the green men though your form is that of my race while your color is little darker than that of the white ape
tell me are you human or are you more than human
it is a strange tale i replied too long to attempt to tell you now and one which i so much doubt the credibility of myself that i fear to hope that others will believe it
suffice it for the present that i am your friend and so far as our captors will permit your protector and your servant
then you too are a prisoner
but why then those arms and the regalia of a tharkian chieftain
what is your name
where your country
yes dejah thoris i too am a prisoner my name is john carter and i claim virginia one of the united states of america earth as my home but why i am permitted to wear arms i do not know nor was i aware that my regalia was that of a chieftain
we were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of the warriors bearing arms accoutrements and ornaments and in a flash one of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me
i saw that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped and i read in the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the other who had brought me my original equipment and now for the first time i realized that my blow on the occasion of my first battle in the audience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary
the reason for the whole attitude displayed toward me was now apparent i had won my spurs so to speak and in the crude justice which always marks martian dealings and which among other things has caused me to call her the planet of paradoxes i was accorded the honors due a conqueror the trappings and the position of the man i killed
in truth i was a martian chieftain and this i learned later was the cause of my great freedom and my toleration in the audience chamber
as i had turned to receive the dead warrior's chattels i had noticed that tars tarkas and several others had pushed forward toward us and the eyes of the former rested upon me in a most quizzical manner
finally he addressed me  you speak the tongue of barsoom quite readily for one who was deaf and dumb to us a few short days ago
where did you learn it john carter
you yourself are responsible tars tarkas i replied in that you furnished me with an instructress of remarkable ability i have to thank sola for my learning
she has done well he answered but your education in other respects needs considerable polish
do you know what your unprecedented temerity would have cost you had you failed to kill either of the two chieftains whose metal you now wear
i presume that that one whom i had failed to kill would have killed me i answered smiling
no you are wrong
only in the last extremity of selfdefense would a martian warrior kill a prisoner we like to save them for other purposes and his face bespoke possibilities that were not pleasant to dwell upon
but one thing can save you now he continued
should you in recognition of your remarkable valor ferocity and prowess be considered by tal hajus as worthy of his service you may be taken into the community and become a fullfledged tharkian
until we reach the headquarters of tal hajus it is the will of lorquas ptomel that you be accorded the respect your acts have earned you
you will be treated by us as a tharkian chieftain but you must not forget that every chief who ranks you is responsible for your safe delivery to our mighty and most ferocious ruler
i am done
i hear you tars tarkas i answered
as you know i am not of barsoom your ways are not my ways and i can only act in the future as i have in the past in accordance with the dictates of my conscience and guided by the standards of mine own people
if you will leave me alone i will go in peace but if not let the individual barsoomians with whom i must deal either respect my rights as a stranger among you or take whatever consequences may befall
of one thing let us be sure whatever may be your ultimate intentions toward this unfortunate young woman whoever would offer her injury or insult in the future must figure on making a full accounting to me
i understand that you belittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness but i do not and i can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics are not incompatible with an ability to fight
ordinarily i am not given to long speeches nor ever before had i descended to bombast but i had guessed at the keynote which would strike an answering chord in the breasts of the green martians nor was i wrong for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them and their attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful
tars tarkas himself seemed pleased with my reply but his only comment was more or less enigmaticaland i think i know tal hajus jeddak of thark
i now turned my attention to dejah thoris and assisting her to her feet i turned with her toward the exit ignoring her hovering guardian harpies as well as the inquiring glances of the chieftains
was i not now a chieftain also
well then i would assume the responsibilities of one
they did not molest us and so dejah thoris princess of helium and john carter gentleman of virginia followed by the faithful woola passed through utter silence from the audience chamber of lorquas ptomel jed among the tharks of barsoom
chapter xi  with dejah thoris   as we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed to watch over dejah thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custody of her once more
the poor child shrank against me and i felt her two little hands fold tightly over my arm
waving the women away i informed them that sola would attend the captive hereafter and i further warned sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed upon dejah thoris would result in sarkoja's sudden and painful demise
my threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to dejah thoris for as i learned later men do not kill women upon mars nor women men
so sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us
i soon found sola and explained to her that i wished her to guard dejah thoris as she had guarded me that i wished her to find other quarters where they would not be molested by sarkoja and i finally informed her that i myself would take up my quarters among the men
sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and slung across my shoulder
you are a great chieftain now john carter she said and i must do your bidding though indeed i am glad to do it under any circumstances
the man whose metal you carry was young but he was a great warrior and had by his promotions and kills won his way close to the rank of tars tarkas who as you know is second to lorquas ptomel only
you are eleventh there are but ten chieftains in this community who rank you in prowess
and if i should kill lorquas ptomel
i asked
you would be first john carter but you may only win that honor by the will of the entire council that lorquas ptomel meet you in combat or should he attack you you may kill him in selfdefense and thus win first place
i laughed and changed the subject
i had no particular desire to kill lorquas ptomel and less to be a jed among the tharks
i accompanied sola and dejah thoris in a search for new quarters which we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more pretentious architecture than our former habitation
we also found in this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly wrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the marble ceilings
the decoration of the walls was most elaborate and unlike the frescoes in the other buildings i had examined portrayed many human figures in the compositions
these were of people like myself and of a much lighter color than dejah thoris
they were clad in graceful flowing robes highly ornamented with metal and jewels and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze
the men were beardless and only a few wore arms
the scenes depicted for the most part a fairskinned fairhaired people at play
dejah thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as she gazed upon these magnificent works of art wrought by a people long extinct while sola on the other hand apparently did not see them
we decided to use this room on the second floor and overlooking the plaza for dejah thoris and sola and another room adjoining and in the rear for the cooking and supplies
i then dispatched sola to bring the bedding and such food and utensils as she might need telling her that i would guard dejah thoris until her return
as sola departed dejah thoris turned to me with a faint smile
and whereto then would your prisoner escape should you leave her unless it was to follow you and crave your protection and ask your pardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these past few days
you are right i answered there is no escape for either of us unless we go together
i heard your challenge to the creature you call tars tarkas and i think i understand your position among these people but what i cannot fathom is your statement that you are not of barsoom
in the name of my first ancestor then she continued where may you be from
you are like unto my people and yet so unlike
you speak my language and yet i heard you tell tars tarkas that you had but learned it recently
all barsoomians speak the same tongue from the iceclad south to the iceclad north though their written languages differ
only in the valley dor where the river iss empties into the lost sea of korus is there supposed to be a different language spoken and except in the legends of our ancestors there is no record of a barsoomian returning up the river iss from the shores of korus in the valley of dor
do not tell me that you have thus returned
they would kill you horribly anywhere upon the surface of barsoom if that were true tell me it is not
her eyes were filled with a strange weird light her voice was pleading and her little hands reached up upon my breast were pressed against me as though to wring a denial from my very heart
i do not know your customs dejah thoris but in my own virginia a gentleman does not lie to save himself i am not of dor i have never seen the mysterious iss the lost sea of korus is still lost so far as i am concerned
do you believe me
and then it struck me suddenly that i was very anxious that she should believe me
it was not that i feared the results which would follow a general belief that i had returned from the barsoomian heaven or hell or whatever it was
why was it then
why should i care what she thought
i looked down at her her beautiful face upturned and her wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul and as my eyes met hers i knew why andi shuddered
a similar wave of feeling seemed to stir her she drew away from me with a sigh and with her earnest beautiful face turned up to mine she whispered i believe you john carter i do not know what a 'gentleman' is nor have i ever heard before of virginia but on barsoom no man lies if he does not wish to speak the truth he is silent
where is this virginia your country john carter
she asked and it seemed that this fair name of my fair land had never sounded more beautiful than as it fell from those perfect lips on that fargone day
i am of another world i answered the great planet earth which revolves about our common sun and next within the orbit of your barsoom which we know as mars
how i came here i cannot tell you for i do not know but here i am and since my presence has permitted me to serve dejah thoris i am glad that i am here
she gazed at me with troubled eyes long and questioningly
that it was difficult to believe my statement i well knew nor could i hope that she would do so however much i craved her confidence and respect
i would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents but no man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightest behest
finally she smiled and rising said i shall have to believe even though i cannot understand
i can readily perceive that you are not of the barsoom of today you are like us yet differentbut why should i trouble my poor head with such a problem when my heart tells me that i believe because i wish to believe
it was good logic good earthly feminine logic and if it satisfied her i certainly could pick no flaws in it
as a matter of fact it was about the only kind of logic that could be brought to bear upon my problem
we fell into a general conversation then asking and answering many questions on each side
she was curious to learn of the customs of my people and displayed a remarkable knowledge of events on earth
when i questioned her closely on this seeming familiarity with earthly things she laughed and cried out  why every school boy on barsoom knows the geography and much concerning the fauna and flora as well as the history of your planet fully as well as of his own
can we not see everything which takes place upon earth as you call it is it not hanging there in the heavens in plain sight
this baffled me i must confess fully as much as my statements had confounded her and i told her so
she then explained in general the instruments her people had used and been perfecting for ages which permit them to throw upon a screen a perfect image of what is transpiring upon any planet and upon many of the stars
these pictures are so perfect in detail that when photographed and enlarged objects no greater than a blade of grass may be distinctly recognized
i afterward in helium saw many of these pictures as well as the instruments which produced them
if then you are so familiar with earthly things i asked why is it that you do not recognize me as identical with the inhabitants of that planet
she smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioning child
because john carter she replied nearly every planet and star having atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of barsoom shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me and further earth men almost without exception cover their bodies with strange unsightly pieces of cloth and their heads with hideous contraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to conceive while you when found by the tharkian warriors were entirely undisfigured and unadorned
the fact that you wore no ornaments is a strong proof of your unbarsoomian origin while the absence of grotesque coverings might cause a doubt as to your earthliness
i then narrated the details of my departure from the earth explaining that my body there lay fully clothed in all the to her strange garments of mundane dwellers
at this point sola returned with our meager belongings and her young martian protege who of course would have to share the quarters with them
sola asked us if we had had a visitor during her absence and seemed much surprised when we answered in the negative
it seemed that as she had mounted the approach to the upper floors where our quarters were located she had met sarkoja descending
we decided that she must have been eavesdropping but as we could recall nothing of importance that had passed between us we dismissed the matter as of little consequence merely promising ourselves to be warned to the utmost caution in the future
dejah thoris and i then fell to examining the architecture and decorations of the beautiful chambers of the building we were occupying
she told me that these people had presumably flourished over a hundred thousand years before
they were the early progenitors of her race but had mixed with the other great race of early martians who were very dark almost black and also with the reddish yellow race which had flourished at the same time
these three great divisions of the higher martians had been forced into a mighty alliance as the drying up of the martian seas had compelled them to seek the comparatively few and always diminishing fertile areas and to defend themselves under new conditions of life against the wild hordes of green men
ages of close relationship and intermarrying had resulted in the race of red men of which dejah thoris was a fair and beautiful daughter
during the ages of hardships and incessant warring between their own various races as well as with the green men and before they had fitted themselves to the changed conditions much of the high civilization and many of the arts of the fairhaired martians had become lost but the red race of today has reached a point where it feels that it has made up in new discoveries and in a more practical civilization for all that lies irretrievably buried with the ancient barsoomians beneath the countless intervening ages
these ancient martians had been a highly cultivated and literary race but during the vicissitudes of those trying centuries of readjustment to new conditions not only did their advancement and production cease entirely but practically all their archives records and literature were lost
dejah thoris related many interesting facts and legends concerning this lost race of noble and kindly people
she said that the city in which we were camping was supposed to have been a center of commerce and culture known as korad
it had been built upon a beautiful natural harbor landlocked by magnificent hills
the little valley on the west front of the city she explained was all that remained of the harbor while the pass through the hills to the old sea bottom had been the channel through which the shipping passed up to the city's gates
the shores of the ancient seas were dotted with just such cities and lesser ones in diminishing numbers were to be found converging toward the center of the oceans as the people had found it necessary to follow the receding waters until necessity had forced upon them their ultimate salvation the socalled martian canals
we had been so engrossed in exploration of the building and in our conversation that it was late in the afternoon before we realized it
we were brought back to a realization of our present conditions by a messenger bearing a summons from lorquas ptomel directing me to appear before him forthwith
bidding dejah thoris and sola farewell and commanding woola to remain on guard i hastened to the audience chamber where i found lorquas ptomel and tars tarkas seated upon the rostrum
chapter xii  a prisoner with power   as i entered and saluted lorquas ptomel signaled me to advance and fixing his great hideous eyes upon me addressed me thus  you have been with us a few days yet during that time you have by your prowess won a high position among us
be that as it may you are not one of us you owe us no allegiance
your position is a peculiar one he continued you are a prisoner and yet you give commands which must be obeyed you are an alien and yet you are a tharkian chieftain you are a midget and yet you can kill a mighty warrior with one blow of your fist
and now you are reported to have been plotting to escape with another prisoner of another race a prisoner who from her own admission half believes you are returned from the valley of dor
either one of these accusations if proved would be sufficient grounds for your execution but we are a just people and you shall have a trial on our return to thark if tal hajus so commands
but he continued in his fierce guttural tones if you run off with the red girl it is i who shall have to account to tal hajus it is i who shall have to face tars tarkas and either demonstrate my right to command or the metal from my dead carcass will go to a better man for such is the custom of the tharks
i have no quarrel with tars tarkas together we rule supreme the greatest of the lesser communities among the green men we do not wish to fight between ourselves and so if you were dead john carter i should be glad
under two conditions only however may you be killed by us without orders from tal hajus in personal combat in selfdefense should you attack one of us or were you apprehended in an attempt to escape
as a matter of justice i must warn you that we only await one of these two excuses for ridding ourselves of so great a responsibility
the safe delivery of the red girl to tal hajus is of the greatest importance
not in a thousand years have the tharks made such a capture she is the granddaughter of the greatest of the red jeddaks who is also our bitterest enemy
i have spoken
the red girl told us that we were without the softer sentiments of humanity but we are a just and truthful race
you may go
turning i left the audience chamber
so this was the beginning of sarkoja's persecution
i knew that none other could be responsible for this report which had reached the ears of lorquas ptomel so quickly and now i recalled those portions of our conversation which had touched upon escape and upon my origin
sarkoja was at this time tars tarkas' oldest and most trusted female
as such she was a mighty power behind the throne for no warrior had the confidence of lorquas ptomel to such an extent as did his ablest lieutenant tars tarkas
however instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my mind my audience with lorquas ptomel only served to center my every faculty on this subject
now more than before the absolute necessity for escape in so far as dejah thoris was concerned was impressed upon me for i was convinced that some horrible fate awaited her at the headquarters of tal hajus
as described by sola this monster was the exaggerated personification of all the ages of cruelty ferocity and brutality from which he had descended
cold cunning calculating he was also in marked contrast to most of his fellows a slave to that brute passion which the waning demands for procreation upon their dying planet has almost stilled in the martian breast
the thought that the divine dejah thoris might fall into the clutches of such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me
far better that we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last moment as did those brave frontier women of my lost land who took their own lives rather than fall into the hands of the indian braves
as i wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings tars tarkas approached me on his way from the audience chamber
his demeanor toward me was unchanged and he greeted me as though we had not just parted a few moments before
where are your quarters john carter
he asked
i have selected none i replied
it seemed best that i quartered either by myself or among the other warriors and i was awaiting an opportunity to ask your advice
as you know and i smiled i am not yet familiar with all the customs of the tharks
come with me he directed and together we moved off across the plaza to a building which i was glad to see adjoined that occupied by sola and her charges
my quarters are on the first floor of this building he said and the second floor also is fully occupied by warriors but the third floor and the floors above are vacant you may take your choice of these
i understand he continued that you have given up your woman to the red prisoner
well as you have said your ways are not our ways but you can fight well enough to do about as you please and so if you wish to give your woman to a captive it is your own affair but as a chieftain you should have those to serve you and in accordance with our customs you may select any or all the females from the retinues of the chieftains whose metal you now wear
i thanked him but assured him that i could get along very nicely without assistance except in the matter of preparing food and so he promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care of my arms and the manufacture of my ammunition which he said would be necessary
i suggested that they might also bring some of the sleeping silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat for the nights were cold and i had none of my own
he promised to do so and departed
left alone i ascended the winding corridor to the upper floors in search of suitable quarters
the beauties of the other buildings were repeated in this and as usual i was soon lost in a tour of investigation and discovery
i finally chose a front room on the third floor because this brought me nearer to dejah thoris whose apartment was on the second floor of the adjoining building and it flashed upon me that i could rig up some means of communication whereby she might signal me in case she needed either my services or my protection
adjoining my sleeping apartment were baths dressing rooms and other sleeping and living apartments in all some ten rooms on this floor
the windows of the back rooms overlooked an enormous court which formed the center of the square made by the buildings which faced the four contiguous streets and which was now given over to the quartering of the various animals belonging to the warriors occupying the adjoining buildings
while the court was entirely overgrown with the yellow mosslike vegetation which blankets practically the entire surface of mars yet numerous fountains statuary benches and pergolalike contraptions bore witness to the beauty which the court must have presented in bygone times when graced by the fairhaired laughing people whom stern and unalterable cosmic laws had driven not only from their homes but from all except the vague legends of their descendants
one could easily picture the gorgeous foliage of the luxuriant martian vegetation which once filled this scene with life and color the graceful figures of the beautiful women the straight and handsome men the happy frolicking childrenall sunlight happiness and peace
it was difficult to realize that they had gone down through ages of darkness cruelty and ignorance until their hereditary instincts of culture and humanitarianism had risen ascendant once more in the final composite race which now is dominant upon mars
my thoughts were cut short by the advent of several young females bearing loads of weapons silks furs jewels cooking utensils and casks of food and drink including considerable loot from the air craft
all this it seemed had been the property of the two chieftains i had slain and now by the customs of the tharks it had become mine
at my direction they placed the stuff in one of the back rooms and then departed only to return with a second load which they advised me constituted the balance of my goods
on the second trip they were accompanied by ten or fifteen other women and youths who it seemed formed the retinues of the two chieftains
they were not their families nor their wives nor their servants the relationship was peculiar and so unlike anything known to us that it is most difficult to describe
all property among the green martians is owned in common by the community except the personal weapons ornaments and sleeping silks and furs of the individuals
these alone can one claim undisputed right to nor may he accumulate more of these than are required for his actual needs
the surplus he holds merely as custodian and it is passed on to the younger members of the community as necessity demands
the women and children of a man's retinue may be likened to a military unit for which he is responsible in various ways as in matters of instruction discipline sustenance and the exigencies of their continual roamings and their unending strife with other communities and with the red martians
his women are in no sense wives
the green martians use no word corresponding in meaning with this earthly word
their mating is a matter of community interest solely and is directed without reference to natural selection
the council of chieftains of each community control the matter as surely as the owner of a kentucky racing stud directs the scientific breeding of his stock for the improvement of the whole
in theory it may sound well as is often the case with theories but the results of ages of this unnatural practice coupled with the community interest in the offspring being held paramount to that of the mother is shown in the cold cruel creatures and their gloomy loveless mirthless existence
it is true that the green martians are absolutely virtuous both men and women with the exception of such degenerates as tal hajus but better far a finer balance of human characteristics even at the expense of a slight and occasional loss of chastity
finding that i must assume responsibility for these creatures whether i would or not i made the best of it and directed them to find quarters on the upper floors leaving the third floor to me
one of the girls i charged with the duties of my simple cuisine and directed the others to take up the various activities which had formerly constituted their vocations
thereafter i saw little of them nor did i care to
chapter xiii  lovemaking on mars   following the battle with the air ships the community remained within the city for several days abandoning the homeward march until they could feel reasonably assured that the ships would not return for to be caught on the open plains with a cavalcade of chariots and children was far from the desire of even so warlike a people as the green martians
during our period of inactivity tars tarkas had instructed me in many of the customs and arts of war familiar to the tharks including lessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which bore the warriors
these creatures which are known as thoats are as dangerous and vicious as their masters but when once subdued are sufficiently tractable for the purposes of the green martians
two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal i wore and in a short time i could handle them quite as well as the native warriors
the method was not at all complicated
if the thoats did not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic instructions of their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with the butt of a pistol and if they showed fight this treatment was continued until the brutes either were subdued or had unseated their riders
in the latter case it became a life and death struggle between the man and the beast
if the former were quick enough with his pistol he might live to ride again though upon some other beast if not his torn and mangled body was gathered up by his women and burned in accordance with tharkian custom
my experience with woola determined me to attempt the experiment of kindness in my treatment of my thoats
first i taught them that they could not unseat me and even rapped them sharply between the ears to impress upon them my authority and mastery
then by degrees i won their confidence in much the same manner as i had adopted countless times with my many mundane mounts
i was ever a good hand with animals and by inclination as well as because it brought more lasting and satisfactory results i was always kind and humane in my dealings with the lower orders
i could take a human life if necessary with far less compunction than that of a poor unreasoning irresponsible brute
in the course of a few days my thoats were the wonder of the entire community
they would follow me like dogs rubbing their great snouts against my body in awkward evidence of affection and respond to my every command with an alacrity and docility which caused the martian warriors to ascribe to me the possession of some earthly power unknown on mars
how have you bewitched them
asked tars tarkas one afternoon when he had seen me run my arm far between the great jaws of one of my thoats which had wedged a piece of stone between two of his teeth while feeding upon the mosslike vegetation within our court yard
by kindness i replied
you see tars tarkas the softer sentiments have their value even to a warrior
in the height of battle as well as upon the march i know that my thoats will obey my every command and therefore my fighting efficiency is enhanced and i am a better warrior for the reason that i am a kind master
your other warriors would find it to the advantage of themselves as well as of the community to adopt my methods in this respect
only a few days since you yourself told me that these great brutes by the uncertainty of their tempers often were the means of turning victory into defeat since at a crucial moment they might elect to unseat and rend their riders
show me how you accomplish these results was tars tarkas' only rejoinder
and so i explained as carefully as i could the entire method of training i had adopted with my beasts and later he had me repeat it before lorquas ptomel and the assembled warriors
that moment marked the beginning of a new existence for the poor thoats and before i left the community of lorquas ptomel i had the satisfaction of observing a regiment of as tractable and docile mounts as one might care to see
the effect on the precision and celerity of the military movements was so remarkable that lorquas ptomel presented me with a massive anklet of gold from his own leg as a sign of his appreciation of my service to the horde
on the seventh day following the battle with the air craft we again took up the march toward thark all probability of another attack being deemed remote by lorquas ptomel
during the days just preceding our departure i had seen but little of dejah thoris as i had been kept very busy by tars tarkas with my lessons in the art of martian warfare as well as in the training of my thoats
the few times i had visited her quarters she had been absent walking upon the streets with sola or investigating the buildings in the near vicinity of the plaza
i had warned them against venturing far from the plaza for fear of the great white apes whose ferocity i was only too well acquainted with
however since woola accompanied them on all their excursions and as sola was well armed there was comparatively little cause for fear
on the evening before our departure i saw them approaching along one of the great avenues which lead into the plaza from the east
i advanced to meet them and telling sola that i would take the responsibility for dejah thoris' safekeeping i directed her to return to her quarters on some trivial errand
i liked and trusted sola but for some reason i desired to be alone with dejah thoris who represented to me all that i had left behind upon earth in agreeable and congenial companionship
there seemed bonds of mutual interest between us as powerful as though we had been born under the same roof rather than upon different planets hurtling through space some fortyeight million miles apart
that she shared my sentiments in this respect i was positive for on my approach the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance to be replaced by a smile of joyful welcome as she placed her little right hand upon my left shoulder in true red martian salute
sarkoja told sola that you had become a true thark she said and that i would now see no more of you than of any of the other warriors
sarkoja is a liar of the first magnitude i replied notwithstanding the proud claim of the tharks to absolute verity
dejah thoris laughed
i knew that even though you became a member of the community you would not cease to be my friend 'a warrior may change his metal but not his heart' as the saying is upon barsoom
i think they have been trying to keep us apart she continued for whenever you have been off duty one of the older women of tars tarkas' retinue has always arranged to trump up some excuse to get sola and me out of sight
they have had me down in the pits below the buildings helping them mix their awful radium powder and make their terrible projectiles
you know that these have to be manufactured by artificial light as exposure to sunlight always results in an explosion
you have noticed that their bullets explode when they strike an object
well the opaque outer coating is broken by the impact exposing a glass cylinder almost solid in the forward end of which is a minute particle of radium powder
the moment the sunlight even though diffused strikes this powder it explodes with a violence which nothing can withstand
if you ever witness a night battle you will note the absence of these explosions while the morning following the battle will be filled at sunrise with the sharp detonations of exploding missiles fired the preceding night
as a rule however nonexploding projectiles are used at night
i have used the word radium in describing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries on earth i believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base
in captain carter's manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in the written language of helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it would be difficult and useless to reproduce
while i was much interested in dejah thoris' explanation of this wonderful adjunct to martian warfare i was more concerned by the immediate problem of their treatment of her
that they were keeping her away from me was not a matter for surprise but that they should subject her to dangerous and arduous labor filled me with rage
have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy dejah thoris
i asked feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestors leap in my veins as i awaited her reply
only in little ways john carter she answered
nothing that can harm me outside my pride
they know that i am the daughter of ten thousand jeddaks that i trace my ancestry straight back without a break to the builder of the first great waterway and they who do not even know their own mothers are jealous of me
at heart they hate their horrid fates and so wreak their poor spite on me who stand for everything they have not and for all they most crave and never can attain
let us pity them my chieftain for even though we die at their hands we can afford them pity since we are greater than they and they know it
had i known the significance of those words my chieftain as applied by a red martian woman to a man i should have had the surprise of my life but i did not know at that time nor for many months thereafter
yes i still had much to learn upon barsoom
i presume it is the better part of wisdom that we bow to our fate with as good grace as possible dejah thoris but i hope nevertheless that i may be present the next time that any martian green red pink or violet has the temerity to even so much as frown on you my princess
dejah thoris caught her breath at my last words and gazed upon me with dilated eyes and quickening breath and then with an odd little laugh which brought roguish dimples to the corners of her mouth she shook her head and cried  what a child
a great warrior and yet a stumbling little child
what have i done now
i asked in sore perplexity
some day you shall know john carter if we live but i may not tell you
and i the daughter of mors kajak son of tardos mors have listened without anger she soliloquized in conclusion
then she broke out again into one of her gay happy laughing moods joking with me on my prowess as a thark warrior as contrasted with my soft heart and natural kindliness
i presume that should you accidentally wound an enemy you would take him home and nurse him back to health she laughed
that is precisely what we do on earth i answered
at least among civilized men
this made her laugh again
she could not understand it for with all her tenderness and womanly sweetness she was still a martian and to a martian the only good enemy is a dead enemy for every dead foeman means so much more to divide between those who live
i was very curious to know what i had said or done to cause her so much perturbation a moment before and so i continued to importune her to enlighten me
no she exclaimed it is enough that you have said it and that i have listened
and when you learn john carter and if i be dead as likely i shall be ere the further moon has circled barsoom another twelve times remember that i listened and that ismiled
it was all greek to me but the more i begged her to explain the more positive became her denials of my request and so in very hopelessness i desisted
day had now given away to night and as we wandered along the great avenue lighted by the two moons of barsoom and with earth looking down upon us out of her luminous green eye it seemed that we were alone in the universe and i at least was content that it should be so
the chill of the martian night was upon us and removing my silks i threw them across the shoulders of dejah thoris
as my arm rested for an instant upon her i felt a thrill pass through every fiber of my being such as contact with no other mortal had even produced and it seemed to me that she had leaned slightly toward me but of that i was not sure
only i knew that as my arm rested there across her shoulders longer than the act of adjusting the silk required she did not draw away nor did she speak
and so in silence we walked the surface of a dying world but in the breast of one of us at least had been born that which is ever oldest yet ever new
i loved dejah thoris
the touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had spoken to me in words i would not mistake and i knew that i had loved her since the first moment that my eyes had met hers that first time in the plaza of the dead city of korad
chapter xiv  a duel to the death   my first impulse was to tell her of my love and then i thought of the helplessness of her position wherein i alone could lighten the burdens of her captivity and protect her in my poor way against the thousands of hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at thark
i could not chance causing her additional pain or sorrow by declaring a love which in all probability she did not return
should i be so indiscreet her position would be even more unbearable than now and the thought that she might feel that i was taking advantage of her helplessness to influence her decision was the final argument which sealed my lips
why are you so quiet dejah thoris
i asked
possibly you would rather return to sola and your quarters
no she murmured i am happy here
i do not know why it is that i should always be happy and contented when you john carter a stranger are with me yet at such times it seems that i am safe and that with you i shall soon return to my father's court and feel his strong arms about me and my mother's tears and kisses on my cheek
do people kiss then upon barsoom
i asked when she had explained the word she used in answer to my inquiry as to its meaning
parents brothers and sisters yes and she added in a low thoughtful tone lovers
and you dejah thoris have parents and brothers and sisters
yes
and alover
she was silent nor could i venture to repeat the question
the man of barsoom she finally ventured does not ask personal questions of women except his mother and the woman he has fought for and won
but i have fought i started and then i wished my tongue had been cut from my mouth for she turned even as i caught myself and ceased and drawing my silks from her shoulder she held them out to me and without a word and with head held high she moved with the carriage of the queen she was toward the plaza and the doorway of her quarters
i did not attempt to follow her other than to see that she reached the building in safety but directing woola to accompany her i turned disconsolately and entered my own house
i sat for hours crosslegged and crosstempered upon my silks meditating upon the queer freaks chance plays upon us poor devils of mortals
so this was love
i had escaped it for all the years i had roamed the five continents and their encircling seas in spite of beautiful women and urging opportunity in spite of a halfdesire for love and a constant search for my ideal it had remained for me to fall furiously and hopelessly in love with a creature from another world of a species similar possibly yet not identical with mine
a woman who was hatched from an egg and whose span of life might cover a thousand years whose people had strange customs and ideas a woman whose hopes whose pleasures whose standards of virtue and of right and wrong might vary as greatly from mine as did those of the green martians
yes i was a fool but i was in love and though i was suffering the greatest misery i had ever known i would not have had it otherwise for all the riches of barsoom
such is love and such are lovers wherever love is known
to me dejah thoris was all that was perfect all that was virtuous and beautiful and noble and good
i believed that from the bottom of my heart from the depth of my soul on that night in korad as i sat crosslegged upon my silks while the nearer moon of barsoom raced through the western sky toward the horizon and lighted up the gold and marble and jeweled mosaics of my worldold chamber and i believe it today as i sit at my desk in the little study overlooking the hudson
twenty years have intervened for ten of them i lived and fought for dejah thoris and her people and for ten i have lived upon her memory
the morning of our departure for thark dawned clear and hot as do all martian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at the poles
i sought out dejah thoris in the throng of departing chariots but she turned her shoulder to me and i could see the red blood mount to her cheek
with the foolish inconsistency of love i held my peace when i might have pled ignorance of the nature of my offense or at least the gravity of it and so have effected at worst a half conciliation
illustration i sought out dejah thoris in the throng of departing chariots
my duty dictated that i must see that she was comfortable and so i glanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs
in doing so i noted with horror that she was heavily chained by one ankle to the side of the vehicle
what does this mean
i cried turning to sola
sarkoja thought it best she answered her face betokening her disapproval of the procedure
examining the manacles i saw that they fastened with a massive spring lock
where is the key sola
let me have it
sarkoja wears it john carter she answered
i turned without further word and sought out tars tarkas to whom i vehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties as they seemed to my lover's eyes that were being heaped upon dejah thoris
john carter he answered if ever you and dejah thoris escape the tharks it will be upon this journey
we know that you will not go without her
you have shown yourself a mighty fighter and we do not wish to manacle you so we hold you both in the easiest way that will yet ensure security
i have spoken
i saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash and knew that it was futile to appeal from his decision but i asked that the key be taken from sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the prisoner alone in future
this much tars tarkas you may do for me in return for the friendship that i must confess i feel for you
friendship
he replied
there is no such thing john carter but have your will
i shall direct that sarkoja cease to annoy the girl and i myself will take the custody of the key
unless you wish me to assume the responsibility i said smiling
he looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke
were you to give me your word that neither you nor dejah thoris would attempt to escape until after we have safely reached the court of tal hajus you might have the key and throw the chains into the river iss
it was better that you held the key tars tarkas i replied  he smiled and said no more but that night as we were making camp i saw him unfasten dejah thoris' fetters himself
with all his cruel ferocity and coldness there was an undercurrent of something in tars tarkas which he seemed ever battling to subdue
could it be a vestige of some human instinct come back from an ancient forbear to haunt him with the horror of his people's ways
as i was approaching dejah thoris' chariot i passed sarkoja and the black venomous look she accorded me was the sweetest balm i had felt for many hours
lord how she hated me
it bristled from her so palpably that one might almost have cut it with a sword
a few moments later i saw her deep in conversation with a warrior named zad a big hulking powerful brute but one who had never made a kill among his own chieftains and so was still an o mad or man with one name he could win a second name only with the metal of some chieftain
it was this custom which entitled me to the names of either of the chieftains i had killed in fact some of the warriors addressed me as dotar sojat a combination of the surnames of the two warrior chieftains whose metal i had taken or in other words whom i had slain in fair fight
as sarkoja talked with zad he cast occasional glances in my direction while she seemed to be urging him very strongly to some action
i paid little attention to it at the time but the next day i had good reason to recall the circumstances and at the same time gain a slight insight into the depths of sarkoja's hatred and the lengths to which she was capable of going to wreak her horrid vengeance on me
dejah thoris would have none of me again on this evening and though i spoke her name she neither replied nor conceded by so much as the flutter of an eyelid that she realized my existence
in my extremity i did what most other lovers would have done i sought word from her through an intimate
in this instance it was sola whom i intercepted in another part of camp
what is the matter with dejah thoris
i blurted out at her
why will she not speak to me
sola seemed puzzled herself as though such strange actions on the part of two humans were quite beyond her as indeed they were poor child
she says you have angered her and that is all she will say except that she is the daughter of a jed and the granddaughter of a jeddak and she has been humiliated by a creature who could not polish the teeth of her grandmother's sorak
i pondered over this report for some time finally asking what might a sorak be sola
a little animal about as big as my hand which the red martian women keep to play with explained sola
not fit to polish the teeth of her grandmother's cat
i must rank pretty low in the consideration of dejah thoris i thought but i could not help laughing at the strange figure of speech so homely and in this respect so earthly
it made me homesick for it sounded very much like not fit to polish her shoes
and then commenced a train of thought quite new to me
i began to wonder what my people at home were doing
i had not seen them for years
there was a family of carters in virginia who claimed close relationship with me i was supposed to be a great uncle or something of the kind equally foolish
i could pass anywhere for twentyfive to thirty years of age and to be a great uncle always seemed the height of incongruity for my thoughts and feelings were those of a boy
there were two little kiddies in the carter family whom i had loved and who had thought there was no one on earth like uncle jack i could see them just as plainly as i stood there under the moonlit skies of barsoom and i longed for them as i had never longed for any mortals before
by nature a wanderer i had never known the true meaning of the word home but the great hall of the carters had always stood for all that the word did mean to me and now my heart turned toward it from the cold and unfriendly peoples i had been thrown amongst
for did not even dejah thoris despise me
i was a low creature so low in fact that i was not even fit to polish the teeth of her grandmother's cat and then my saving sense of humor came to my rescue and laughing i turned into my silks and furs and slept upon the moonhaunted ground the sleep of a tired and healthy fighting man
we broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only a single halt until just before dark
two incidents broke the tediousness of the march
about noon we espied far to our right what was evidently an incubator and lorquas ptomel directed tars tarkas to investigate it
the latter took a dozen warriors including myself and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the little enclosure
it was indeed an incubator but the eggs were very small in comparison with those i had seen hatching in ours at the time of my arrival on mars
tars tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely finally announcing that it belonged to the green men of warhoon and that the cement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up
they cannot be a day's march ahead of us he exclaimed the light of battle leaping to his fierce face
the work at the incubator was short indeed
the warriors tore open the entrance and a couple of them crawling in soon demolished all the eggs with their shortswords
then remounting we dashed back to join the cavalcade
during the ride i took occasion to ask tars tarkas if these warhoons whose eggs we had destroyed were a smaller people than his tharks
i noticed that their eggs were so much smaller than those i saw hatching in your incubator i added
he explained that the eggs had just been placed there but like all green martian eggs they would grow during the fiveyear period of incubation until they obtained the size of those i had seen hatching on the day of my arrival on barsoom
this was indeed an interesting piece of information for it had always seemed remarkable to me that the green martian women large as they were could bring forth such enormous eggs as i had seen the fourfoot infants emerging from
as a matter of fact the newlaid egg is but little larger than an ordinary goose egg and as it does not commence to grow until subjected to the light of the sun the chieftains have little difficulty in transporting several hundreds of them at one time from the storage vaults to the incubators
shortly after the incident of the warhoon eggs we halted to rest the animals and it was during this halt that the second of the day's interesting episodes occurred
i was engaged in changing my riding cloths from one of my thoats to the other for i divided the day's work between them when zad approached me and without a word struck my animal a terrific blow with his longsword
i did not need a manual of green martian etiquette to know what reply to make for in fact i was so wild with anger that i could scarcely refrain from drawing my pistol and shooting him down for the brute he was but he stood waiting with drawn longsword and my only choice was to draw my own and meet him in fair fight with his choice of weapons or a lesser one
this latter alternative is always permissible therefore i could have used my shortsword my dagger my hatchet or my fists had i wished and been entirely within my rights but i could not use firearms or a spear while he held only his longsword
i chose the same weapon he had drawn because i knew he prided himself upon his ability with it and i wished if i worsted him at all to do it with his own weapon
the fight that followed was a long one and delayed the resumption of the march for an hour
the entire community surrounded us leaving a clear space about one hundred feet in diameter for our battle
zad first attempted to rush me down as a bull might a wolf but i was much too quick for him and each time i sidestepped his rushes he would go lunging past me only to receive a nick from my sword upon his arm or back
he was soon streaming blood from a half dozen minor wounds but i could not obtain an opening to deliver an effective thrust
then he changed his tactics and fighting warily and with extreme dexterity he tried to do by science what he was unable to do by brute strength
i must admit that he was a magnificent swordsman and had it not been for my greater endurance and the remarkable agility the lesser gravitation of mars lent me i might not have been able to put up the creditable fight i did against him
we circled for some time without doing much damage on either side the long straight needlelike swords flashing in the sunlight and ringing out upon the stillness as they crashed together with each effective parry
finally zad realizing that he was tiring more than i evidently decided to close in and end the battle in a final blaze of glory for himself just as he rushed me a blinding flash of light struck full in my eyes so that i could not see his approach and could only leap blindly to one side in an effort to escape the mighty blade that it seemed i could already feel in my vitals
i was only partially successful as a sharp pain in my left shoulder attested but in the sweep of my glance as i sought to again locate my adversary a sight met my astonished gaze which paid me well for the wound the temporary blindness had caused me
there upon dejah thoris' chariot stood three figures for the purpose evidently of witnessing the encounter above the heads of the intervening tharks
there were dejah thoris sola and sarkoja and as my fleeting glance swept over them a little tableau was presented which will stand graven in my memory to the day of my death
as i looked dejah thoris turned upon sarkoja with the fury of a young tigress and struck something from her upraised hand something which flashed in the sunlight as it spun to the ground
then i knew what had blinded me at that crucial moment of the fight and how sarkoja had found a way to kill me without herself delivering the final thrust
another thing i saw too which almost lost my life for me then and there for it took my mind for the fraction of an instant entirely from my antagonist for as dejah thoris struck the tiny mirror from her hand sarkoja her face livid with hatred and baffled rage whipped out her dagger and aimed a terrific blow at dejah thoris and then sola our dear and faithful sola sprang between them the last i saw was the great knife descending upon her shielding breast
my enemy had recovered from his thrust and was making it extremely interesting for me so i reluctantly gave my attention to the work in hand but my mind was not upon the battle
we rushed each other furiously time after time 'til suddenly feeling the sharp point of his sword at my breast in a thrust i could neither parry nor escape i threw myself upon him with outstretched sword and with all the weight of my body determined that i would not die alone if i could prevent it
i felt the steel tear into my chest all went black before me my head whirled in dizziness and i felt my knees giving beneath me
chapter xv  sola tells me her story   when consciousness returned and as i soon learned i was down but a moment i sprang quickly to my feet searching for my sword and there i found it buried to the hilt in the green breast of zad who lay stone dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom
as i regained my full senses i found his weapon piercing my left breast but only through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs entering near the center of my chest and coming out below the shoulder
as i had lunged i had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound
removing the blade from my body i also regained my own and turning my back upon his ugly carcass i moved sick sore and disgusted toward the chariots which bore my retinue and my belongings
a murmur of martian applause greeted me but i cared not for it
bleeding and weak i reached my women who accustomed to such happenings dressed my wounds applying the wonderful healing and remedial agents which make only the most instantaneous of death blows fatal
give a martian woman a chance and death must take a back seat
they soon had me patched up so that except for weakness from loss of blood and a little soreness around the wound i suffered no great distress from this thrust which under earthly treatment undoubtedly would have put me flat on my back for days
as soon as they were through with me i hastened to the chariot of dejah thoris where i found my poor sola with her chest swathed in bandages but apparently little the worse for her encounter with sarkoja whose dagger it seemed had struck the edge of one of sola's metal breast ornaments and thus deflected had inflicted but a slight flesh wound
as i approached i found dejah thoris lying prone upon her silks and furs her lithe form wracked with sobs
she did not notice my presence nor did she hear me speaking with sola who was standing a short distance from the vehicle
is she injured
i asked of sola indicating dejah thoris by an inclination of my head
no she answered she thinks that you are dead
and that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its teeth
i queried smiling
i think you wrong her john carter said sola
i do not understand either her ways or yours but i am sure the granddaughter of ten thousand jeddaks would never grieve like this over any who held but the highest claim upon her affections
they are a proud race but they are just as are all barsoomians and you must have hurt or wronged her grievously that she will not admit your existence living though she mourns you dead
tears are a strange sight upon barsoom she continued and so it is difficult for me to interpret them
i have seen but two people weep in all my life other than dejah thoris one wept from sorrow the other from baffled rage
the first was my mother years ago before they killed her the other was sarkoja when they dragged her from me today
your mother
i exclaimed but sola you could not have known your mother child
but i did
and my father also she added
if you would like to hear the strange and unbarsoomian story come to the chariot tonight john carter and i will tell you that of which i have never spoken in all my life before
and now the signal has been given to resume the march you must go
i will come tonight sola i promised
be sure to tell dejah thoris i am alive and well
i shall not force myself upon her and be sure that you do not let her know i saw her tears
if she would speak with me i but await her command
sola mounted the chariot which was swinging into its place in line and i hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped to my station beside tars tarkas at the rear of the column
we made a most imposing and aweinspiring spectacle as we strung out across the yellow landscape the two hundred and fifty ornate and brightly colored chariots preceded by an advance guard of some two hundred mounted warriors and chieftains riding five abreast and one hundred yards apart and followed by a like number in the same formation with a score or more of flankers on either side the fifty extra mastodons or heavy draught animals known as zitidars and the five or six hundred extra thoats of the warriors running loose within the hollow square formed by the surrounding warriors
the gleaming metal and jewels of the gorgeous ornaments of the men and women duplicated in the trappings of the zitidars and thoats and interspersed with the flashing colors of magnificent silks and furs and feathers lent a barbaric splendor to the caravan which would have turned an east indian potentate green with envy
the enormous broad tires of the chariots and the padded feet of the animals brought forth no sound from the mosscovered sea bottom and so we moved in utter silence like some huge phantasmagoria except when the stillness was broken by the guttural growling of a goaded zitidar or the squealing of fighting thoats
the green martians converse but little and then usually in monosyllables low and like the faint rumbling of distant thunder
we traversed a trackless waste of moss which bending to the pressure of broad tire or padded foot rose up again behind us leaving no sign that we had passed
we might indeed have been the wraiths of the departed dead upon the dead sea of that dying planet for all the sound or sign we made in passing
it was the first march of a large body of men and animals i had ever witnessed which raised no dust and left no spoor for there is no dust upon mars except in the cultivated districts during the winter months and even then the absence of high winds renders it almost unnoticeable
we camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been approaching for two days and which marked the southern boundary of this particular sea
our animals had been two days without drink nor had they had water for nearly two months not since shortly after leaving thark but as tars tarkas explained to me they require but little and can live almost indefinitely upon the moss which covers barsoom and which he told me holds in its tiny stems sufficient moisture to meet the limited demands of the animals
after partaking of my evening meal of cheeselike food and vegetable milk i sought out sola whom i found working by the light of a torch upon some of tars tarkas' trappings
she looked up at my approach her face lighting with pleasure and with welcome
i am glad you came she said dejah thoris sleeps and i am lonely
mine own people do not care for me john carter i am too unlike them
it is a sad fate since i must live my life amongst them and i often wish that i were a true green martian woman without love and without hope but i have known love and so i am lost
i promised to tell you my story or rather the story of my parents
from what i have learned of you and the ways of your people i am sure that the tale will not seem strange to you but among green martians it has no parallel within the memory of the oldest living thark nor do our legends hold many similar tales
my mother was rather small in fact too small to be allowed the responsibilities of maternity as our chieftains breed principally for size
she was also less cold and cruel than most green martian women and caring little for their society she often roamed the deserted avenues of thark alone or went and sat among the wild flowers that deck the nearby hills thinking thoughts and wishing wishes which i believe i alone among tharkian women today may understand for am i not the child of my mother
and there among the hills she met a young warrior whose duty it was to guard the feeding zitidars and thoats and see that they roamed not beyond the hills
they spoke at first only of such things as interest a community of tharks but gradually as they came to meet more often and as was now quite evident to both no longer by chance they talked about themselves their likes their ambitions and their hopes
she trusted him and told him of the awful repugnance she felt for the cruelties of their kind for the hideous loveless lives they must ever lead and then she waited for the storm of denunciation to break from his cold hard lips but instead he took her in his arms and kissed her
they kept their love a secret for six long years
she my mother was of the retinue of the great tal hajus while her lover was a simple warrior wearing only his own metal
had their defection from the traditions of the tharks been discovered both would have paid the penalty in the great arena before tal hajus and the assembled hordes
the egg from which i came was hidden beneath a great glass vessel upon the highest and most inaccessible of the partially ruined towers of ancient thark
once each year my mother visited it for the five long years it lay there in the process of incubation
she dared not come oftener for in the mighty guilt of her conscience she feared that her every move was watched
during this period my father gained great distinction as a warrior and had taken the metal from several chieftains
his love for my mother had never diminished and his own ambition in life was to reach a point where he might wrest the metal from tal hajus himself and thus as ruler of the tharks be free to claim her as his own as well as by the might of his power protect the child which otherwise would be quickly dispatched should the truth become known
it was a wild dream that of wresting the metal from tal hajus in five short years but his advance was rapid and he soon stood high in the councils of thark
but one day the chance was lost forever in so far as it could come in time to save his loved ones for he was ordered away upon a long expedition to the iceclad south to make war upon the natives there and despoil them of their furs for such is the manner of the green barsoomian he does not labor for what he can wrest in battle from others
he was gone for four years and when he returned all had been over for three for about a year after his departure and shortly before the time for the return of an expedition which had gone forth to fetch the fruits of a community incubator the egg had hatched
thereafter my mother continued to keep me in the old tower visiting me nightly and lavishing upon me the love the community life would have robbed us both of
she hoped upon the return of the expedition from the incubator to mix me with the other young assigned to the quarters of tal hajus and thus escape the fate which would surely follow discovery of her sin against the ancient traditions of the green men
she taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind and one night she told me the story i have told to you up to this point impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great caution i must exercise after she had placed me with the other young tharks to permit no one to guess that i was further advanced in education than they nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of others my affection for her or my knowledge of my parentage and then drawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father
and then a light flashed out upon the darkness of the tower chamber and there stood sarkoja her gleaming baleful eyes fixed in a frenzy of loathing and contempt upon my mother
the torrent of hatred and abuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold in terror
that she had heard the entire story was apparent and that she had suspected something wrong from my mother's long nightly absences from her quarters accounted for her presence there on that fateful night
one thing she had not heard nor did she know the whispered name of my father
this was apparent from her repeated demands upon my mother to disclose the name of her partner in sin but no amount of abuse or threats could wring this from her and to save me from needless torture she lied for she told sarkoja that she alone knew nor would she ever tell her child
with final imprecations sarkoja hastened away to tal hajus to report her discovery and while she was gone my mother wrapping me in the silks and furs of her night coverings so that i was scarcely noticeable descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward the outskirts of the city in the direction which led to the far south out toward the man whose protection she might not claim but on whose face she wished to look once more before she died
as we neared the city's southern extremity a sound came to us from across the mossy flat from the direction of the only pass through the hills which led to the gates the pass by which caravans from either north or south or east or west would enter the city
the sounds we heard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars with the occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body of warriors
the thought uppermost in her mind was that it was my father returned from his expedition but the cunning of the thark held her from headlong and precipitate flight to greet him
retreating into the shadows of a doorway she awaited the coming of the cavalcade which shortly entered the avenue breaking its formation and thronging the thoroughfare from wall to wall
as the head of the procession passed us the lesser moon swung clear of the overhanging roofs and lit up the scene with all the brilliancy of her wondrous light
my mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows and from her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of my father but the returning caravan bearing the young tharks
instantly her plan was formed and as a great chariot swung close to our hiding place she slipped stealthily in upon the trailing tailboard crouching low in the shadow of the high side straining me to her bosom in a frenzy of love
she knew what i did not that never again after that night would she hold me to her breast nor was it likely we would ever look upon each other's face again
in the confusion of the plaza she mixed me with the other children whose guardians during the journey were now free to relinquish their responsibility
we were herded together into a great room fed by women who had not accompanied the expedition and the next day we were parceled out among the retinues of the chieftains
i never saw my mother after that night
she was imprisoned by tal hajus and every effort including the most horrible and shameful torture was brought to bear upon her to wring from her lips the name of my father but she remained steadfast and loyal dying at last amidst the laughter of tal hajus and his chieftains during some awful torture she was undergoing
i learned afterwards that she told them that she had killed me to save me from a like fate at their hands and that she had thrown my body to the white apes
sarkoja alone disbelieved her and i feel to this day that she suspects my true origin but does not dare expose me at the present at all events because she also guesses i am sure the identity of my father
when he returned from his expedition and learned the story of my mother's fate i was present as tal hajus told him but never by the quiver of a muscle did he betray the slightest emotion only he did not laugh as tal hajus gleefully described her death struggles
from that moment on he was the cruelest of the cruel and i am awaiting the day when he shall win the goal of his ambition and feel the carcass of tal hajus beneath his foot for i am as sure that he but waits the opportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance and that his great love is as strong in his breast as when it first transfigured him nearly forty years ago as i am that we sit here upon the edge of a worldold ocean while sensible people sleep john carter
and your father sola is he with us now
i asked
yes she replied but he does not know me for what i am nor does he know who betrayed my mother to tal hajus
i alone know my father's name and only i and tal hajus and sarkoja know that it was she who carried the tale that brought death and torture upon her he loved
we sat silent for a few moments she wrapped in the gloomy thoughts of her terrible past and i in pity for the poor creatures whom the heartless senseless customs of their race had doomed to loveless lives of cruelty and of hate
presently she spoke
john carter if ever a real man walked the cold dead bosom of barsoom you are one
i know that i can trust you and because the knowledge may someday help you or him or dejah thoris or myself i am going to tell you the name of my father nor place any restrictions or conditions upon your tongue
when the time comes speak the truth if it seems best to you
i trust you because i know that you are not cursed with the terrible trait of absolute and unswerving truthfulness that you could lie like one of your own virginia gentlemen if a lie would save others from sorrow or suffering
my father's name is tars tarkas
chapter xvi  we plan escape   the remainder of our journey to thark was uneventful
we were twenty days upon the road crossing two sea bottoms and passing through or around a number of ruined cities mostly smaller than korad
twice we crossed the famous martian waterways or canals socalled by our earthly astronomers
when we approached these points a warrior would be sent far ahead with a powerful field glass and if no great body of red martian troops was in sight we would advance as close as possible without chance of being seen and then camp until dark when we would slowly approach the cultivated tract and locating one of the numerous broad highways which cross these areas at regular intervals creep silently and stealthily across to the arid lands upon the other side
it required five hours to make one of these crossings without a single halt and the other consumed the entire night so that we were just leaving the confines of the highwalled fields when the sun broke out upon us
crossing in the darkness as we did i was unable to see but little except as the nearer moon in her wild and ceaseless hurtling through the barsoomian heavens lit up little patches of the landscape from time to time disclosing walled fields and low rambling buildings presenting much the appearance of earthly farms
there were many trees methodically arranged and some of them were of enormous height there were animals in some of the enclosures and they announced their presence by terrified squealings and snortings as they scented our queer wild beasts and wilder human beings
only once did i perceive a human being and that was at the intersection of our crossroad with the wide white turnpike which cuts each cultivated district longitudinally at its exact center
the fellow must have been sleeping beside the road for as i came abreast of him he raised upon one elbow and after a single glance at the approaching caravan leaped shrieking to his feet and fled madly down the road scaling a nearby wall with the agility of a scared cat
the tharks paid him not the slightest attention they were not out upon the warpath and the only sign that i had that they had seen him was a quickening of the pace of the caravan as we hastened toward the bordering desert which marked our entrance into the realm of tal hajus
not once did i have speech with dejah thoris as she sent no word to me that i would be welcome at her chariot and my foolish pride kept me from making any advances
i verily believe that a man's way with women is in inverse ratio to his prowess among men
the weakling and the saphead have often great ability to charm the fair sex while the fighting man who can face a thousand real dangers unafraid sits hiding in the shadows like some frightened child
just thirty days after my advent upon barsoom we entered the ancient city of thark from whose longforgotten people this horde of green men have stolen even their name
the hordes of thark number some thirty thousand souls and are divided into twentyfive communities
each community has its own jed and lesser chieftains but all are under the rule of tal hajus jeddak of thark
five communities make their headquarters at the city of thark and the balance are scattered among other deserted cities of ancient mars throughout the district claimed by tal hajus
we made our entry into the great central plaza early in the afternoon
there were no enthusiastic friendly greetings for the returned expedition
those who chanced to be in sight spoke the names of warriors or women with whom they came in direct contact in the formal greeting of their kind but when it was discovered that they brought two captives a greater interest was aroused and dejah thoris and i were the centers of inquiring groups
we were soon assigned to new quarters and the balance of the day was devoted to settling ourselves to the changed conditions
my home now was upon an avenue leading into the plaza from the south the main artery down which we had marched from the gates of the city
i was at the far end of the square and had an entire building to myself
the same grandeur of architecture which was so noticeable a characteristic of korad was in evidence here only if that were possible on a larger and richer scale
my quarters would have been suitable for housing the greatest of earthly emperors but to these queer creatures nothing about a building appealed to them but its size and the enormity of its chambers the larger the building the more desirable and so tal hajus occupied what must have been an enormous public building the largest in the city but entirely unfitted for residence purposes the next largest was reserved for lorquas ptomel the next for the jed of a lesser rank and so on to the bottom of the list of five jeds
the warriors occupied the buildings with the chieftains to whose retinues they belonged or if they preferred sought shelter among any of the thousands of untenanted buildings in their own quarter of town each community being assigned a certain section of the city
the selection of building had to be made in accordance with these divisions except in so far as the jeds were concerned they all occupying edifices which fronted upon the plaza
when i had finally put my house in order or rather seen that it had been done it was nearing sunset and i hastened out with the intention of locating sola and her charges as i had determined upon having speech with dejah thoris and trying to impress on her the necessity of our at least patching up a truce until i could find some way of aiding her to escape
i searched in vain until the upper rim of the great red sun was just disappearing behind the horizon and then i spied the ugly head of woola peering from a secondstory window on the opposite side of the very street where i was quartered but nearer the plaza
without waiting for a further invitation i bolted up the winding runway which led to the second floor and entering a great chamber at the front of the building was greeted by the frenzied woola who threw his great carcass upon me nearly hurling me to the floor the poor old fellow was so glad to see me that i thought he would devour me his head split from ear to ear showing his three rows of tusks in his hobgoblin smile
quieting him with a word of command and a caress i looked hurriedly through the approaching gloom for a sign of dejah thoris and then not seeing her i called her name
there was an answering murmur from the far corner of the apartment and with a couple of quick strides i was standing beside her where she crouched among the furs and silks upon an ancient carved wooden seat
as i waited she rose to her full height and looking me straight in the eye said  what would dotar sojat thark of dejah thoris his captive
dejah thoris i do not know how i have angered you
it was furtherest from my desire to hurt or offend you whom i had hoped to protect and comfort
have none of me if it is your will but that you must aid me in effecting your escape if such a thing be possible is not my request but my command
when you are safe once more at your father's court you may do with me as you please but from now on until that day i am your master and you must obey and aid me
she looked at me long and earnestly and i thought that she was softening toward me
i understand your words dotar sojat she replied but you i do not understand
you are a queer mixture of child and man of brute and noble
i only wish that i might read your heart
look down at your feet dejah thoris it lies there now where it has lain since that other night at korad and where it will ever lie beating alone for you until death stills it forever
she took a little step toward me her beautiful hands outstretched in a strange groping gesture
what do you mean john carter
she whispered
what are you saying to me
i am saying what i had promised myself that i would not say to you at least until you were no longer a captive among the green men what from your attitude toward me for the past twenty days i had thought never to say to you i am saying dejah thoris that i am yours body and soul to serve you to fight for you and to die for you
only one thing i ask of you in return and that is that you make no sign either of condemnation or of approbation of my words until you are safe among your own people and that whatever sentiments you harbor toward me they be not influenced or colored by gratitude whatever i may do to serve you will be prompted solely from selfish motives since it gives me more pleasure to serve you than not
i will respect your wishes john carter because i understand the motives which prompt them and i accept your service no more willingly than i bow to your authority your word shall be my law
i have twice wronged you in my thoughts and again i ask your forgiveness
further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the entrance of sola who was much agitated and wholly unlike her usual calm and possessed self
that horrible sarkoja has been before tal hajus she cried and from what i heard upon the plaza there is little hope for either of you
what do they say
inquired dejah thoris
that you will be thrown to the wild calots dogs in the great arena as soon as the hordes have assembled for the yearly games
sola i said you are a thark but you hate and loathe the customs of your people as much as we do
will you not accompany us in one supreme effort to escape
i am sure that dejah thoris can offer you a home and protection among her people and your fate can be no worse among them than it must ever be here
yes cried dejah thoris come with us sola you will be better off among the red men of helium than you are here and i can promise you not only a home with us but the love and affection your nature craves and which must always be denied you by the customs of your own race
come with us sola we might go without you but your fate would be terrible if they thought you had connived to aid us
i know that even that fear would not tempt you to interfere in our escape but we want you with us we want you to come to a land of sunshine and happiness amongst a people who know the meaning of love of sympathy and of gratitude
say that you will sola tell me that you will
the great waterway which leads to helium is but fifty miles to the south murmured sola half to herself a swift thoat might make it in three hours and then to helium it is five hundred miles most of the way through thinly settled districts
they would know and they would follow us
we might hide among the great trees for a time but the chances are small indeed for escape
they would follow us to the very gates of helium and they would take toll of life at every step you do not know them
is there no other way we might reach helium
i asked
can you not draw me a rough map of the country we must traverse dejah thoris
yes she replied and taking a great diamond from her hair she drew upon the marble floor the first map of barsoomian territory i had ever seen
it was crisscrossed in every direction with long straight lines sometimes running parallel and sometimes converging toward some great circle
the lines she said were waterways the circles cities and one far to the northwest of us she pointed out as helium
there were other cities closer but she said she feared to enter many of them as they were not all friendly toward helium
illustration she drew upon the marble floor the first map of the barsoomian territory i had ever seen
finally after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room i pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which also seemed to lead to helium
does not this pierce your grandfather's territory
i asked
yes she answered but it is two hundred miles north of us it is one of the waterways we crossed on the trip to thark
they would never suspect that we would try for that distant waterway i answered and that is why i think that it is the best route for our escape
sola agreed with me and it was decided that we should leave thark this same night just as quickly in fact as i could find and saddle my thoats
sola was to ride one and dejah thoris and i the other each of us carrying sufficient food and drink to last us for two days since the animals could not be urged too rapidly for so long a distance
i directed sola to proceed with dejah thoris along one of the less frequented avenues to the southern boundary of the city where i would overtake them with the thoats as quickly as possible then leaving them to gather what food silks and furs we were to need i slipped quietly to the rear of the first floor and entered the courtyard where our animals were moving restlessly about as was their habit before settling down for the night
in the shadows of the buildings and out beneath the radiance of the martian moons moved the great herd of thoats and zitidars the latter grunting their low gutturals and the former occasionally emitting the sharp squeal which denotes the almost habitual state of rage in which these creatures passed their existence
they were quieter now owing to the absence of man but as they scented me they became more restless and their hideous noise increased
it was risky business this entering a paddock of thoats alone and at night first because their increasing noisiness might warn the nearby warriors that something was amiss and also because for the slightest cause or for no cause at all some great bull thoat might take it upon himself to lead a charge upon me
having no desire to awaken their nasty tempers upon such a night as this where so much depended upon secrecy and dispatch i hugged the shadows of the buildings ready at an instant's warning to leap into the safety of a nearby door or window
thus i moved silently to the great gates which opened upon the street at the back of the court and as i neared the exit i called softly to my two animals
how i thanked the kind providence which had given me the foresight to win the love and confidence of these wild dumb brutes for presently from the far side of the court i saw two huge bulks forcing their way toward me through the surging mountains of flesh
they came quite close to me rubbing their muzzles against my body and nosing for the bits of food it was always my practice to reward them with
opening the gates i ordered the two great beasts to pass out and then slipping quietly after them i closed the portals behind me
i did not saddle or mount the animals there but instead walked quietly in the shadows of the buildings toward an unfrequented avenue which led toward the point i had arranged to meet dejah thoris and sola
with the noiselessness of disembodied spirits we moved stealthily along the deserted streets but not until we were within sight of the plain beyond the city did i commence to breathe freely
i was sure that sola and dejah thoris would find no difficulty in reaching our rendezvous undetected but with my great thoats i was not so sure for myself as it was quite unusual for warriors to leave the city after dark in fact there was no place for them to go within any but a long ride
i reached the appointed meeting place safely but as dejah thoris and sola were not there i led my animals into the entrance hall of one of the large buildings
presuming that one of the other women of the same household may have come in to speak to sola and so delayed their departure i did not feel any undue apprehension until nearly an hour had passed without a sign of them and by the time another half hour had crawled away i was becoming filled with grave anxiety
then there broke upon the stillness of the night the sound of an approaching party which from the noise i knew could be no fugitives creeping stealthily toward liberty
soon the party was near me and from the black shadows of my entranceway i perceived a score of mounted warriors who in passing dropped a dozen words that fetched my heart clean into the top of my head
he would likely have arranged to meet them just without the city and so  i heard no more they had passed on but it was enough
our plan had been discovered and the chances for escape from now on to the fearful end would be small indeed
my one hope now was to return undetected to the quarters of dejah thoris and learn what fate had overtaken her but how to do it with these great monstrous thoats upon my hands now that the city probably was aroused by the knowledge of my escape was a problem of no mean proportions
suddenly an idea occurred to me and acting on my knowledge of the construction of the buildings of these ancient martian cities with a hollow court within the center of each square i groped my way blindly through the dark chambers calling the great thoats after me
they had difficulty in negotiating some of the doorways but as the buildings fronting the city's principal exposures were all designed upon a magnificent scale they were able to wriggle through without sticking fast and thus we finally made the inner court where i found as i had expected the usual carpet of mosslike vegetation which would provide their food and drink until i could return them to their own enclosure
that they would be as quiet and contented here as elsewhere i was confident nor was there but the remotest possibility that they would be discovered as the green men had no great desire to enter these outlying buildings which were frequented by the only thing i believe which caused them the sensation of fearthe great white apes of barsoom
removing the saddle trappings i hid them just within the rear doorway of the building through which we had entered the court and turning the beasts loose quickly made my way across the court to the rear of the buildings upon the further side and thence to the avenue beyond
waiting in the doorway of the building until i was assured that no one was approaching i hurried across to the opposite side and through the first doorway to the court beyond thus crossing through court after court with only the slight chance of detection which the necessary crossing of the avenues entailed i made my way in safety to the courtyard in the rear of dejah thoris' quarters
here of course i found the beasts of the warriors who quartered in the adjacent buildings and the warriors themselves i might expect to meet within if i entered but fortunately for me i had another and safer method of reaching the upper story where dejah thoris should be found and after first determining as nearly as possible which of the buildings she occupied for i had never observed them before from the court side i took advantage of my relatively great strength and agility and sprang upward until i grasped the sill of a secondstory window which i thought to be in the rear of her apartment
drawing myself inside the room i moved stealthily toward the front of the building and not until i had quite reached the doorway of her room was i made aware by voices that it was occupied
i did not rush headlong in but listened without to assure myself that it was dejah thoris and that it was safe to venture within
it was well indeed that i took this precaution for the conversation i heard was in the low gutturals of men and the words which finally came to me proved a most timely warning
the speaker was a chieftain and he was giving orders to four of his warriors
and when he returns to this chamber he was saying as he surely will when he finds she does not meet him at the city's edge you four are to spring upon him and disarm him
it will require the combined strength of all of you to do it if the reports they bring back from korad are correct
when you have him fast bound bear him to the vaults beneath the jeddak's quarters and chain him securely where he may be found when tal hajus wishes him
allow him to speak with none nor permit any other to enter this apartment before he comes
there will be no danger of the girl returning for by this time she is safe in the arms of tal hajus and may all her ancestors have pity upon her for tal hajus will have none the great sarkoja has done a noble night's work
i go and if you fail to capture him when he comes i commend your carcasses to the cold bosom of iss
chapter xvii  a costly recapture   as the speaker ceased he turned to leave the apartment by the door where i was standing but i needed to wait no longer i had heard enough to fill my soul with dread and stealing quietly away i returned to the courtyard by the way i had come
my plan of action was formed upon the instant and crossing the square and the bordering avenue upon the opposite side i soon stood within the courtyard of tal hajus
the brilliantly lighted apartments of the first floor told me where first to seek and advancing to the windows i peered within
i soon discovered that my approach was not to be the easy thing i had hoped for the rear rooms bordering the court were filled with warriors and women
i then glanced up at the stories above discovering that the third was apparently unlighted and so decided to make my entrance to the building from that point
it was the work of but a moment for me to reach the windows above and soon i had drawn myself within the sheltering shadows of the unlighted third floor
fortunately the room i had selected was untenanted and creeping noiselessly to the corridor beyond i discovered a light in the apartments ahead of me
reaching what appeared to be a doorway i discovered that it was but an opening upon an immense inner chamber which towered from the first floor two stories below me to the domelike roof of the building high above my head
the floor of this great circular hall was thronged with chieftains warriors and women and at one end was a great raised platform upon which squatted the most hideous beast i had ever put my eyes upon
he had all the cold hard cruel terrible features of the green warriors but accentuated and debased by the animal passions to which he had given himself over for many years
there was not a mark of dignity or pride upon his bestial countenance while his enormous bulk spread itself out upon the platform where he squatted like some huge devil fish his six limbs accentuating the similarity in a horrible and startling manner
but the sight that froze me with apprehension was that of dejah thoris and sola standing there before him and the fiendish leer of him as he let his great protruding eyes gloat upon the lines of her beautiful figure
she was speaking but i could not hear what she said nor could i make out the low grumbling of his reply
she stood there erect before him her head high held and even at the distance i was from them i could read the scorn and disgust upon her face as she let her haughty glance rest without sign of fear upon him
she was indeed the proud daughter of a thousand jeddaks every inch of her dear precious little body so small so frail beside the towering warriors around her but in her majesty dwarfing them into insignificance she was the mightiest figure among them and i verily believe that they felt it
presently tal hajus made a sign that the chamber be cleared and that the prisoners be left alone before him
slowly the chieftains the warriors and the women melted away into the shadows of the surrounding chambers and dejah thoris and sola stood alone before the jeddak of the tharks
one chieftain alone had hesitated before departing i saw him standing in the shadows of a mighty column his fingers nervously toying with the hilt of his greatsword and his cruel eyes bent in implacable hatred upon tal hajus
it was tars tarkas and i could read his thoughts as they were an open book for the undisguised loathing upon his face
he was thinking of that other woman who forty years ago had stood before this beast and could i have spoken a word into his ear at that moment the reign of tal hajus would have been over but finally he also strode from the room not knowing that he left his own daughter at the mercy of the creature he most loathed
tal hajus arose and i half fearing half anticipating his intentions hurried to the winding runway which led to the floors below
no one was near to intercept me and i reached the main floor of the chamber unobserved taking my station in the shadow of the same column that tars tarkas had but just deserted
as i reached the floor tal hajus was speaking
princess of helium i might wring a mighty ransom from your people would i but return you to them unharmed but a thousand times rather would i watch that beautiful face writhe in the agony of torture it shall be long drawn out that i promise you ten days of pleasure were all too short to show the love i harbor for your race
the terrors of your death shall haunt the slumbers of the red men through all the ages to come they will shudder in the shadows of the night as their fathers tell them of the awful vengeance of the green men of the power and might and hate and cruelty of tal hajus
but before the torture you shall be mine for one short hour and word of that too shall go forth to tardos mors jeddak of helium your grandfather that he may grovel upon the ground in the agony of his sorrow
tomorrow the torture will commence tonight thou art tal hajus' come
he sprang down from the platform and grasped her roughly by the arm but scarcely had he touched her than i leaped between them
my shortsword sharp and gleaming was in my right hand i could have plunged it into his putrid heart before he realized that i was upon him but as i raised my arm to strike i thought of tars tarkas and with all my rage with all my hatred i could not rob him of that sweet moment for which he had lived and hoped all these long weary years and so instead i swung my good right fist full upon the point of his jaw
without a sound he slipped to the floor as one dead
in the same deathly silence i grasped dejah thoris by the hand and motioning sola to follow we sped noiselessly from the chamber and to the floor above
unseen we reached a rear window and with the straps and leather of my trappings i lowered first sola and then dejah thoris to the ground below
dropping lightly after them i drew them rapidly around the court in the shadows of the buildings and thus we returned over the same course i had so recently followed from the distant boundary of the city
we finally came upon my thoats in the courtyard where i had left them and placing the trappings upon them we hastened through the building to the avenue beyond
mounting sola upon one beast and dejah thoris behind me upon the other we rode from the city of thark through the hills to the south
instead of circling back around the city to the northwest and toward the nearest waterway which lay so short a distance from us we turned to the northeast and struck out upon the mossy waste across which for two hundred dangerous and weary miles lay another main artery leading to helium
no word was spoken until we had left the city far behind but i could hear the quiet sobbing of dejah thoris as she clung to me with her dear head resting against my shoulder
if we make it my chieftain the debt of helium will be a mighty one greater than she can ever pay you and should we not make it she continued the debt is no less though helium will never know for you have saved the last of our line from worse than death
i did not answer but instead reached to my side and pressed the little fingers of her i loved where they clung to me for support and then in unbroken silence we sped over the yellow moonlit moss each of us occupied with his own thoughts
for my part i could not be other than joyful had i tried with dejah thoris' warm body pressed close to mine and with all our unpassed danger my heart was singing as gaily as though we were already entering the gates of helium
our earlier plans had been so sadly upset that we now found ourselves without food or drink and i alone was armed
we therefore urged our beasts to a speed that must tell on them sorely before we could hope to sight the ending of the first stage of our journey
we rode all night and all the following day with only a few short rests
on the second night both we and our animals were completely fagged and so we lay down upon the moss and slept for some five or six hours taking up the journey once more before daylight
all the following day we rode and when late in the afternoon we had sighted no distant trees the mark of the great waterways throughout all barsoom the terrible truth flashed upon uswe were lost
evidently we had circled but which way it was difficult to say nor did it seem possible with the sun to guide us by day and the moons and stars by night
at any rate no waterway was in sight and the entire party was almost ready to drop from hunger thirst and fatigue
far ahead of us and a trifle to the right we could distinguish the outlines of low mountains
these we decided to attempt to reach in the hope that from some ridge we might discern the missing waterway
night fell upon us before we reached our goal and almost fainting from weariness and weakness we lay down and slept
i was awakened early in the morning by some huge body pressing close to mine and opening my eyes with a start i beheld my blessed old woola snuggling close to me the faithful brute had followed us across that trackless waste to share our fate whatever it might be
putting my arms about his neck i pressed my cheek close to his nor am i ashamed that i did it nor of the tears that came to my eyes as i thought of his love for me
shortly after this dejah thoris and sola awakened and it was decided that we push on at once in an effort to gain the hills
we had gone scarcely a mile when i noticed that my thoat was commencing to stumble and stagger in a most pitiful manner although we had not attempted to force them out of a walk since about noon of the preceding day
suddenly he lurched wildly to one side and pitched violently to the ground
dejah thoris and i were thrown clear of him and fell upon the soft moss with scarcely a jar but the poor beast was in a pitiable condition not even being able to rise although relieved of our weight
sola told me that the coolness of the night when it fell together with the rest would doubtless revive him and so i decided not to kill him as was my first intention as i had thought it cruel to leave him alone there to die of hunger and thirst
relieving him of his trappings which i flung down beside him we left the poor fellow to his fate and pushed on with the one thoat as best we could
sola and i walked making dejah thoris ride much against her will
in this way we had progressed to within about a mile of the hills we were endeavoring to reach when dejah thoris from her point of vantage upon the thoat cried out that she saw a great party of mounted men filing down from a pass in the hills several miles away
sola and i both looked in the direction she indicated and there plainly discernible were several hundred mounted warriors
they seemed to be headed in a southwesterly direction which would take them away from us
they doubtless were thark warriors who had been sent out to capture us and we breathed a great sigh of relief that they were traveling in the opposite direction
quickly lifting dejah thoris from the thoat i commanded the animal to lie down and we three did the same presenting as small an object as possible for fear of attracting the attention of the warriors toward us
we could see them as they filed out of the pass just for an instant before they were lost to view behind a friendly ridge to us a most providential ridge since had they been in view for any great length of time they scarcely could have failed to discover us
as what proved to be the last warrior came into view from the pass he halted and to our consternation threw his small but powerful fieldglass to his eye and scanned the sea bottom in all directions
evidently he was a chieftain for in certain marching formations among the green men a chieftain brings up the extreme rear of the column
as his glass swung toward us our hearts stopped in our breasts and i could feel the cold sweat start from every pore in my body
presently it swung full upon us andstopped
the tension on our nerves was near the breaking point and i doubt if any of us breathed for the few moments he held us covered by his glass and then he lowered it and we could see him shout a command to the warriors who had passed from our sight behind the ridge
he did not wait for them to join him however instead he wheeled his thoat and came tearing madly in our direction
there was but one slight chance and that we must take quickly
raising my strange martian rifle to my shoulder i sighted and touched the button which controlled the trigger there was a sharp explosion as the missile reached its goal and the charging chieftain pitched backward from his flying mount
springing to my feet i urged the thoat to rise and directed sola to take dejah thoris with her upon him and make a mighty effort to reach the hills before the green warriors were upon us
i knew that in the ravines and gullies they might find a temporary hiding place and even though they died there of hunger and thirst it would be better so than that they fell into the hands of the tharks
forcing my two revolvers upon them as a slight means of protection and as a last resort as an escape for themselves from the horrid death which recapture would surely mean i lifted dejah thoris in my arms and placed her upon the thoat behind sola who had already mounted at my command
goodbye my princess i whispered we may meet in helium yet
i have escaped from worse plights than this and i tried to smile as i lied
what she cried are you not coming with us
how may i dejah thoris
someone must hold these fellows off for a while and i can better escape them alone than could the three of us together
she sprang quickly from the thoat and throwing her dear arms about my neck turned to sola saying with quiet dignity fly sola
dejah thoris remains to die with the man she loves
those words are engraved upon my heart
ah gladly would i give up my life a thousand times could i only hear them once again but i could not then give even a second to the rapture of her sweet embrace and pressing my lips to hers for the first time i picked her up bodily and tossed her to her seat behind sola again commanding the latter in peremptory tones to hold her there by force and then slapping the thoat upon the flank i saw them borne away dejah thoris struggling to the last to free herself from sola's grasp
turning i beheld the green warriors mounting the ridge and looking for their chieftain
in a moment they saw him and then me but scarcely had they discovered me than i commenced firing lying flat upon my belly in the moss
i had an even hundred rounds in the magazine of my rifle and another hundred in the belt at my back and i kept up a continuous stream of fire until i saw all of the warriors who had been first to return from behind the ridge either dead or scurrying to cover
my respite was shortlived however for soon the entire party numbering some thousand men came charging into view racing madly toward me
i fired until my rifle was empty and they were almost upon me and then a glance showing me that dejah thoris and sola had disappeared among the hills i sprang up throwing down my useless gun and started away in the direction opposite to that taken by sola and her charge
if ever martians had an exhibition of jumping it was granted those astonished warriors on that day long years ago but while it led them away from dejah thoris it did not distract their attention from endeavoring to capture me
they raced wildly after me until finally my foot struck a projecting piece of quartz and down i went sprawling upon the moss
as i looked up they were upon me and although i drew my longsword in an attempt to sell my life as dearly as possible it was soon over
i reeled beneath their blows which fell upon me in perfect torrents my head swam all was black and i went down beneath them to oblivion
chapter xviii  chained in warhoon   it must have been several hours before i regained consciousness and i well remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as i realized that i was not dead
i was lying among a pile of sleeping silks and furs in the corner of a small room in which were several green warriors and bending over me was an ancient and ugly female
as i opened my eyes she turned to one of the warriors saying  he will live o jed
'tis well replied the one so addressed rising and approaching my couch he should render rare sport for the great games
and now as my eyes fell upon him i saw that he was no thark for his ornaments and metal were not of that horde
he was a huge fellow terribly scarred about the face and chest and with one broken tusk and a missing ear
strapped on either breast were human skulls and depending from these a number of dried human hands
his reference to the great games of which i had heard so much while among the tharks convinced me that i had but jumped from purgatory into gehenna
after a few more words with the female during which she assured him that i was now fully fit to travel the jed ordered that we mount and ride after the main column
i was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as i had ever seen and with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent the beast from bolting we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of the column
my wounds gave me but little pain so wonderfully and rapidly had the applications and injections of the female exercised their therapeutic powers and so deftly had she bound and plastered the injuries
just before dark we reached the main body of troops shortly after they had made camp for the night
i was immediately taken before the leader who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of warhoon
like the jed who had brought me he was frightfully scarred and also decorated with the breastplate of human skulls and dried dead hands which seemed to mark all the greater warriors among the warhoons as well as to indicate their awful ferocity which greatly transcends even that of the tharks
the jeddak bar comas who was comparatively young was the object of the fierce and jealous hatred of his old lieutenant dak kova the jed who had captured me and i could not but note the almost studied efforts which the latter made to affront his superior
he entirely omitted the usual formal salutation as we entered the presence of the jeddak and as he pushed me roughly before the ruler he exclaimed in a loud and menacing voice
i have brought a strange creature wearing the metal of a thark whom it is my pleasure to have battle with a wild thoat at the great games
he will die as bar comas your jeddak sees fit if at all replied the young ruler with emphasis and dignity
if at all
roared dak kova
by the dead hands at my throat but he shall die bar comas
no maudlin weakness on your part shall save him
o would that warhoon were ruled by a real jeddak rather than by a waterhearted weakling from whom even old dak kova could tear the metal with his bare hands
bar comas eyed the defiant and insubordinate chieftain for an instant his expression one of haughty fearless contempt and hate and then without drawing a weapon and without uttering a word he hurled himself at the throat of his defamer
i never before had seen two green martian warriors battle with nature's weapons and the exhibition of animal ferocity which ensued was as fearful a thing as the most disordered imagination could picture
they tore at each others' eyes and ears with their hands and with their gleaming tusks repeatedly slashed and gored until both were cut fairly to ribbons from head to foot
bar comas had much the better of the battle as he was stronger quicker and more intelligent
it soon seemed that the encounter was done saving only the final death thrust when bar comas slipped in breaking away from a clinch
it was the one little opening that dak kova needed and hurling himself at the body of his adversary he buried his single mighty tusk in bar comas' groin and with a last powerful effort ripped the young jeddak wide open the full length of his body the great tusk finally wedging in the bones of bar comas' jaw
victor and vanquished rolled limp and lifeless upon the moss a huge mass of torn and bloody flesh
bar comas was stone dead and only the most herculean efforts on the part of dak kova's females saved him from the fate he deserved
three days later he walked without assistance to the body of bar comas which by custom had not been moved from where it fell and placing his foot upon the neck of his erstwhile ruler he assumed the title of jeddak of warhoon
the dead jeddak's hands and head were removed to be added to the ornaments of his conqueror and then his women cremated what remained amid wild and terrible laughter
the injuries to dak kova had delayed the march so greatly that it was decided to give up the expedition which was a raid upon a small thark community in retaliation for the destruction of the incubator until after the great games and the entire body of warriors ten thousand in number turned back toward warhoon
my introduction to these cruel and bloodthirsty people was but an index to the scenes i witnessed almost daily while with them
they are a smaller horde than the tharks but much more ferocious
not a day passed but that some members of the various warhoon communities met in deadly combat
i have seen as high as eight mortal duels within a single day
we reached the city of warhoon after some three days march and i was immediately cast into a dungeon and heavily chained to the floor and walls
food was brought me at intervals but owing to the utter darkness of the place i do not know whether i lay there days or weeks or months
it was the most horrible experience of all my life and that my mind did not give way to the terrors of that inky blackness has been a wonder to me ever since
the place was filled with creeping crawling things cold sinuous bodies passed over me when i lay down and in the darkness i occasionally caught glimpses of gleaming fiery eyes fixed in horrible intentness upon me
no sound reached me from the world above and no word would my jailer vouchsafe when my food was brought to me although i at first bombarded him with questions
finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful creatures who had placed me in this horrible place was centered by my tottering reason upon this single emissary who represented to me the entire horde of warhoons
i had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where he could place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it upon the floor his head was about on a level with my breast
so with the cunning of a madman i backed into the far corner of my cell when next i heard him approaching and gathering a little slack of the great chain which held me in my hand i waited his coming crouching like some beast of prey
as he stooped to place my food upon the ground i swung the chain above my head and crashed the links with all my strength upon his skull
without a sound he slipped to the floor stone dead
laughing and chattering like the idiot i was fast becoming i fell upon his prostrate form my fingers feeling for his dead throat
presently they came in contact with a small chain at the end of which dangled a number of keys
the touch of my fingers on these keys brought back my reason with the suddenness of thought
no longer was i a jibbering idiot but a sane reasoning man with the means of escape within my very hands
as i was groping to remove the chain from about my victim's neck i glanced up into the darkness to see six pairs of gleaming eyes fixed unwinking upon me
slowly they approached and slowly i shrank back from the awful horror of them
back into my corner i crouched holding my hands palms out before me and stealthily on came the awful eyes until they reached the dead body at my feet
then slowly they retreated but this time with a strange grating sound and finally they disappeared in some black and distant recess of my dungeon
chapter xix  battling in the arena   slowly i regained my composure and finally essayed again to attempt to remove the keys from the dead body of my former jailer
but as i reached out into the darkness to locate it i found to my horror that it was gone
then the truth flashed on me the owners of those gleaming eyes had dragged my prize away from me to be devoured in their neighboring lair as they had been waiting for days for weeks for months through all this awful eternity of my imprisonment to drag my dead carcass to their feast
for two days no food was brought me but then a new messenger appeared and my incarceration went on as before but not again did i allow my reason to be submerged by the horror of my position
shortly after this episode another prisoner was brought in and chained near me
by the dim torch light i saw that he was a red martian and i could scarcely await the departure of his guards to address him
as their retreating footsteps died away in the distance i called out softly the martian word of greeting kaor
who are you who speaks out of the darkness
he answered  john carter a friend of the red men of helium
i am of helium he said but i do not recall your name
and then i told him my story as i have written it here omitting only any reference to my love for dejah thoris
he was much excited by the news of helium's princess and seemed quite positive that she and sola could easily have reached a point of safety from where they left me
he said that he knew the place well because the defile through which the warhoon warriors had passed when they discovered us was the only one ever used by them when marching to the south
dejah thoris and sola entered the hills not five miles from a great waterway and are now probably quite safe he assured me
my fellow prisoner was kantos kan a padwar lieutenant in the navy of helium
he had been a member of the illfated expedition which had fallen into the hands of the tharks at the time of dejah thoris' capture and he briefly related the events which followed the defeat of the battleships
badly injured and only partially manned they had limped slowly toward helium but while passing near the city of zodanga the capital of helium's hereditary enemies among the red men of barsoom they had been attacked by a great body of war vessels and all but the craft to which kantos kan belonged were either destroyed or captured
his vessel was chased for days by three of the zodangan war ships but finally escaped during the darkness of a moonless night
thirty days after the capture of dejah thoris or about the time of our coming to thark his vessel had reached helium with about ten survivors of the original crew of seven hundred officers and men
immediately seven great fleets each of one hundred mighty war ships had been dispatched to search for dejah thoris and from these vessels two thousand smaller craft had been kept out continuously in futile search for the missing princess
two green martian communities had been wiped off the face of barsoom by the avenging fleets but no trace of dejah thoris had been found
they had been searching among the northern hordes and only within the past few days had they extended their quest to the south
kantos kan had been detailed to one of the small oneman fliers and had had the misfortune to be discovered by the warhoons while exploring their city
the bravery and daring of the man won my greatest respect and admiration
alone he had landed at the city's boundary and on foot had penetrated to the buildings surrounding the plaza
for two days and nights he had explored their quarters and their dungeons in search of his beloved princess only to fall into the hands of a party of warhoons as he was about to leave after assuring himself that dejah thoris was not a captive there
during the period of our incarceration kantos kan and i became well acquainted and formed a warm personal friendship
a few days only elapsed however before we were dragged forth from our dungeon for the great games
we were conducted early one morning to an enormous amphitheater which instead of having been built upon the surface of the ground was excavated below the surface
it had partially filled with debris so that how large it had originally been was difficult to say
in its present condition it held the entire twenty thousand warhoons of the assembled hordes
the arena was immense but extremely uneven and unkempt
around it the warhoons had piled building stone from some of the ruined edifices of the ancient city to prevent the animals and the captives from escaping into the audience and at each end had been constructed cages to hold them until their turns came to meet some horrible death upon the arena
kantos kan and i were confined together in one of the cages
in the others were wild calots thoats mad zitidars green warriors and women of other hordes and many strange and ferocious wild beasts of barsoom which i had never before seen
the din of their roaring growling and squealing was deafening and the formidable appearance of any one of them was enough to make the stoutest heart feel grave forebodings
kantos kan explained to me that at the end of the day one of these prisoners would gain freedom and the others would lie dead about the arena
the winners in the various contests of the day would be pitted against each other until only two remained alive the victor in the last encounter being set free whether animal or man
the following morning the cages would be filled with a new consignment of victims and so on throughout the ten days of the games
shortly after we had been caged the amphitheater began to fill and within an hour every available part of the seating space was occupied
dak kova with his jeds and chieftains sat at the center of one side of the arena upon a large raised platform
at a signal from dak kova the doors of two cages were thrown open and a dozen green martian females were driven to the center of the arena
each was given a dagger and then at the far end a pack of twelve calots or wild dogs were loosed upon them
as the brutes growling and foaming rushed upon the almost defenseless women i turned my head that i might not see the horrid sight
the yells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellent quality of the sport and when i turned back to the arena as kantos kan told me it was over i saw three victorious calots snarling and growling over the bodies of their prey
the women had given a good account of themselves
next a mad zitidar was loosed among the remaining dogs and so it went throughout the long hot horrible day
during the day i was pitted against first men and then beasts but as i was armed with a longsword and always outclassed my adversary in agility and generally in strength as well it proved but child's play to me
time and time again i won the applause of the bloodthirsty multitude and toward the end there were cries that i be taken from the arena and be made a member of the hordes of warhoon
finally there were but three of us left a great green warrior of some far northern horde kantos kan and myself
the other two were to battle and then i to fight the conqueror for the liberty which was accorded the final winner
kantos kan had fought several times during the day and like myself had always proven victorious but occasionally by the smallest of margins especially when pitted against the green warriors
i had little hope that he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all before him during the day
the fellow towered nearly sixteen feet in height while kantos kan was some inches under six feet
as they advanced to meet one another i saw for the first time a trick of martian swordsmanship which centered kantos kan's every hope of victory and life on one cast of the dice for as he came to within about twenty feet of the huge fellow he threw his sword arm far behind him over his shoulder and with a mighty sweep hurled his weapon point foremost at the green warrior
it flew true as an arrow and piercing the poor devil's heart laid him dead upon the arena
kantos kan and i were now pitted against each other but as we approached to the encounter i whispered to him to prolong the battle until nearly dark in the hope that we might find some means of escape
the horde evidently guessed that we had no hearts to fight each other and so they howled in rage as neither of us placed a fatal thrust
just as i saw the sudden coming of dark i whispered to kantos kan to thrust his sword between my left arm and my body
as he did so i staggered back clasping the sword tightly with my arm and thus fell to the ground with his weapon apparently protruding from my chest
kantos kan perceived my coup and stepping quickly to my side he placed his foot upon my neck and withdrawing his sword from my body gave me the final death blow through the neck which is supposed to sever the jugular vein but in this instance the cold blade slipped harmlessly into the sand of the arena
in the darkness which had now fallen none could tell but that he had really finished me
i whispered to him to go and claim his freedom and then look for me in the hills east of the city and so he left me
when the amphitheater had cleared i crept stealthily to the top and as the great excavation lay far from the plaza and in an untenanted portion of the great dead city i had little trouble in reaching the hills beyond
chapter xx  in the atmosphere factory   for two days i waited there for kantos kan but as he did not come i started off on foot in a northwesterly direction toward a point where he had told me lay the nearest waterway
my only food consisted of vegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of this priceless fluid
through two long weeks i wandered stumbling through the nights guided only by the stars and hiding during the days behind some protruding rock or among the occasional hills i traversed
several times i was attacked by wild beasts strange uncouth monstrosities that leaped upon me in the dark so that i had ever to grasp my longsword in my hand that i might be ready for them
usually my strange newly acquired telepathic power warned me in ample time but once i was down with vicious fangs at my jugular and a hairy face pressed close to mine before i knew that i was even threatened
what manner of thing was upon me i did not know but that it was large and heavy and manylegged i could feel
my hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury themselves in my neck and slowly i forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers viselike upon its windpipe
without sound we lay there the beast exerting every effort to reach me with those awful fangs and i straining to maintain my grip and choke the life from it as i kept it from my throat
slowly my arms gave to the unequal struggle and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleaming tusks of my antagonist crept toward me until as the hairy face touched mine again i realized that all was over
and then a living mass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon the creature that held me pinioned to the ground
the two rolled growling upon the moss tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above the throat of the dead thing which would have killed me
the nearer moon hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting up the barsoomian scene showed me that my preserver was woola but from whence he had come or how found me i was at a loss to know
that i was glad of his companionship it is needless to say but my pleasure at seeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leaving dejah thoris
only her death i felt sure could account for his absence from her so faithful i knew him to be to my commands
by the light of the now brilliant moons i saw that he was but a shadow of his former self and as he turned from my caress and commenced greedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet i realized that the poor fellow was more than half starved
i myself was in but little better plight but i could not bring myself to eat the uncooked flesh and i had no means of making a fire
when woola had finished his meal i again took up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of the elusive waterway
at daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search i was overjoyed to see the high trees that denoted the object of my search
about noon i dragged myself wearily to the portals of a huge building which covered perhaps four square miles and towered two hundred feet in the air
it showed no aperture in the mighty walls other than the tiny door at which i sank exhausted nor was there any sign of life about it
i could find no bell or other method of making my presence known to the inmates of the place unless a small round hole in the wall near the door was for that purpose
it was of about the bigness of a lead pencil and thinking that it might be in the nature of a speaking tube i put my mouth to it and was about to call into it when a voice issued from it asking me whom i might be where from and the nature of my errand
i explained that i had escaped from the warhoons and was dying of starvation and exhaustion
you wear the metal of a green warrior and are followed by a calot yet you are of the figure of a red man
in color you are neither green nor red
in the name of the ninth ray what manner of creature are you
i am a friend of the red men of barsoom and i am starving
in the name of humanity open to us i replied
presently the door commenced to recede before me until it had sunk into the wall fifty feet then it stopped and slid easily to the left exposing a short narrow corridor of concrete at the further end of which was another door similar in every respect to the one i had just passed
no one was in sight yet immediately we passed the first door it slid gently into place behind us and receded rapidly to its original position in the front wall of the building
as the door had slipped aside i had noted its great thickness fully twenty feet and as it reached its place once more after closing behind us great cylinders of steel had dropped from the ceiling behind it and fitted their lower ends into apertures countersunk in the floor
a second and third door receded before me and slipped to one side as the first before i reached a large inner chamber where i found food and drink set out upon a great stone table
a voice directed me to satisfy my hunger and to feed my calot and while i was thus engaged my invisible host put me through a severe and searching crossexamination
your statements are most remarkable said the voice on concluding its questioning but you are evidently speaking the truth and it is equally evident that you are not of barsoom
i can tell that by the conformation of your brain and the strange location of your internal organs and the shape and size of your heart
can you see through me
i exclaimed
yes i can see all but your thoughts and were you a barsoomian i could read those
then a door opened at the far side of the chamber and a strange dried up little mummy of a man came toward me
he wore but a single article of clothing or adornment a small collar of gold from which depended upon his chest a great ornament as large as a dinner plate set solid with huge diamonds except for the exact center which was occupied by a strange stone an inch in diameter that scintillated nine different and distinct rays the seven colors of our earthly prism and two beautiful rays which to me were new and nameless
i cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man
i only know that they were beautiful in the extreme
the old man sat and talked with me for hours and the strangest part of our intercourse was that i could read his every thought while he could not fathom an iota from my mind unless i spoke
illustration the old man sat and talked with me for hours
i did not apprise him of my ability to sense his mental operations and thus i learned a great deal which proved of immense value to me later and which i would never have known had he suspected my strange power for the martians have such perfect control of their mental machinery that they are able to direct their thoughts with absolute precision
the building in which i found myself contained the machinery which produces that artificial atmosphere which sustains life on mars
the secret of the entire process hinges on the use of the ninth ray one of the beautiful scintillations which i had noted emanating from the great stone in my host's diadem
this ray is separated from the other rays of the sun by means of finely adjusted instruments placed upon the roof of the huge building threequarters of which is used for reservoirs in which the ninth ray is stored
this product is then treated electrically or rather certain proportions of refined electric vibrations are incorporated with it and the result is then pumped to the five principal air centers of the planet where as it is released contact with the ether of space transforms it into atmosphere
there is always sufficient reserve of the ninth ray stored in the great building to maintain the present martian atmosphere for a thousand years and the only fear as my new friend told me was that some accident might befall the pumping apparatus
he led me to an inner chamber where i beheld a battery of twenty radium pumps any one of which was equal to the task of furnishing all mars with the atmosphere compound
for eight hundred years he told me he had watched these pumps which are used alternately a day each at a stretch or a little over twentyfour and onehalf earth hours
he has one assistant who divides the watch with him
half a martian year about three hundred and fortyfour of our days each of these men spend alone in this huge isolated plant
every red martian is taught during earliest childhood the principles of the manufacture of atmosphere but only two at one time ever hold the secret of ingress to the great building which built as it is with walls a hundred and fifty feet thick is absolutely unassailable even the roof being guarded from assault by air craft by a glass covering five feet thick
the only fear they entertain of attack is from the green martians or some demented red man as all barsoomians realize that the very existence of every form of life of mars is dependent upon the uninterrupted working of this plant
one curious fact i discovered as i watched his thoughts was that the outer doors are manipulated by telepathic means
the locks are so finely adjusted that the doors are released by the action of a certain combination of thought waves
to experiment with my newfound toy i thought to surprise him into revealing this combination and so i asked him in a casual manner how he had managed to unlock the massive doors for me from the inner chambers of the building
as quick as a flash there leaped to his mind nine martian sounds but as quickly faded as he answered that this was a secret he must not divulge
from then on his manner toward me changed as though he feared that he had been surprised into divulging his great secret and i read suspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts though his words were still fair
before i retired for the night he promised to give me a letter to a nearby agricultural officer who would help me on my way to zodanga which he said was the nearest martian city
but be sure that you do not let them know you are bound for helium as they are at war with that country
my assistant and i are of no country we belong to all barsoom and this talisman which we wear protects us in all lands even among the green menthough we do not trust ourselves to their hands if we can avoid it he added
and so goodnight my friend he continued may you have a long and restful sleepyes a long sleep
and though he smiled pleasantly i saw in his thoughts the wish that he had never admitted me and then a picture of him standing over me in the night and the swift thrust of a long dagger and the half formed words i am sorry but it is for the best good of barsoom
as he closed the door of my chamber behind him his thoughts were cut off from me as was the sight of him which seemed strange to me in my little knowledge of thought transference
what was i to do
how could i escape through these mighty walls
easily could i kill him now that i was warned but once he was dead i could no more escape and with the stopping of the machinery of the great plant i should die with all the other inhabitants of the planetall even dejah thoris were she not already dead
for the others i did not give the snap of my finger but the thought of dejah thoris drove from my mind all desire to kill my mistaken host
cautiously i opened the door of my apartment and followed by woola sought the inner of the great doors
a wild scheme had come to me i would attempt to force the great locks by the nine thought waves i had read in my host's mind
creeping stealthily through corridor after corridor and down winding runways which turned hither and thither i finally reached the great hall in which i had broken my long fast that morning
nowhere had i seen my host nor did i know where he kept himself by night
i was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slight noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in the corridor
dragging woola after me i crouched low in the darkness
presently the old man passed close by me and as he entered the dimly lighted chamber which i had been about to pass through i saw that he held a long thin dagger in his hand and that he was sharpening it upon a stone
in his mind was the decision to inspect the radium pumps which would take about thirty minutes and then return to my bed chamber and finish me
as he passed through the great hall and disappeared down the runway which led to the pumproom i stole stealthily from my hiding place and crossed to the great door the inner of the three which stood between me and liberty
concentrating my mind upon the massive lock i hurled the nine thought waves against it
in breathless expectancy i waited when finally the great door moved softly toward me and slid quietly to one side
one after the other the remaining mighty portals opened at my command and woola and i stepped forth into the darkness free but little better off than we had been before other than that we had full stomachs
hastening away from the shadows of the formidable pile i made for the first crossroad intending to strike the central turnpike as quickly as possible
this i reached about morning and entering the first enclosure i came to i searched for some evidences of a habitation
there were low rambling buildings of concrete barred with heavy impassable doors and no amount of hammering and hallooing brought any response
weary and exhausted from sleeplessness i threw myself upon the ground commanding woola to stand guard
some time later i was awakened by his frightful growlings and opened my eyes to see three red martians standing a short distance from us and covering me with their rifles
i am unarmed and no enemy i hastened to explain
i have been a prisoner among the green men and am on my way to zodanga
all i ask is food and rest for myself and my calot and the proper directions for reaching my destination
they lowered their rifles and advanced pleasantly toward me placing their right hands upon my left shoulder after the manner of their custom of salute and asking me many questions about myself and my wanderings
they then took me to the house of one of them which was only a short distance away
the buildings i had been hammering at in the early morning were occupied only by stock and farm produce the house proper standing among a grove of enormous trees and like all redmartian homes had been raised at night some forty or fifty feet from the ground on a large round metal shaft which slid up or down within a sleeve sunk in the ground and was operated by a tiny radium engine in the entrance hall of the building
instead of bothering with bolts and bars for their dwellings the red martians simply run them up out of harm's way during the night
they also have private means for lowering or raising them from the ground without if they wish to go away and leave them
these brothers with their wives and children occupied three similar houses on this farm
they did no work themselves being government officers in charge
the labor was performed by convicts prisoners of war delinquent debtors and confirmed bachelors who were too poor to pay the high celibate tax which all redmartian governments impose
they were the personification of cordiality and hospitality and i spent several days with them resting and recuperating from my long and arduous experiences
when they had heard my storyi omitted all reference to dejah thoris and the old man of the atmosphere plantthey advised me to color my body to more nearly resemble their own race and then attempt to find employment in zodanga either in the army or the navy
the chances are small that your tale will be believed until after you have proven your trustworthiness and won friends among the higher nobles of the court
this you can most easily do through military service as we are a warlike people on barsoom explained one of them and save our richest favors for the fighting man
when i was ready to depart they furnished me with a small domestic bull thoat such as is used for saddle purposes by all red martians
the animal is about the size of a horse and quite gentle but in color and shape an exact replica of his huge and fierce cousin of the wilds
the brothers had supplied me with a reddish oil with which i anointed my entire body and one of them cut my hair which had grown quite long in the prevailing fashion of the time square at the back and banged in front so that i could have passed anywhere upon barsoom as a fullfledged red martian
my metal and ornaments were also renewed in the style of a zodangan gentleman attached to the house of ptor which was the family name of my benefactors
they filled a little sack at my side with zodangan money
the medium of exchange upon mars is not dissimilar from our own except that the coins are oval
paper money is issued by individuals as they require it and redeemed twice yearly
if a man issues more than he can redeem the government pays his creditors in full and the debtor works out the amount upon the farms or in mines which are all owned by the government
this suits everybody except the debtor as it has been a difficult thing to obtain sufficient voluntary labor to work the great isolated farm lands of mars stretching as they do like narrow ribbons from pole to pole through wild stretches peopled by wild animals and wilder men
when i mentioned my inability to repay them for their kindness to me they assured me that i would have ample opportunity if i lived long upon barsoom and bidding me farewell they watched me until i was out of sight upon the broad white turnpike
chapter xxi  an air scout for zodanga   as i proceeded on my journey toward zodanga many strange and interesting sights arrested my attention and at the several farm houses where i stopped i learned a number of new and instructive things concerning the methods and manners of barsoom
the water which supplies the farms of mars is collected in immense underground reservoirs at either pole from the melting ice caps and pumped through long conduits to the various populated centers
along either side of these conduits and extending their entire length lie the cultivated districts
these are divided into tracts of about the same size each tract being under the supervision of one or more government officers
instead of flooding the surface of the fields and thus wasting immense quantities of water by evaporation the precious liquid is carried underground through a vast network of small pipes directly to the roots of the vegetation
the crops upon mars are always uniform for there are no droughts no rains no high winds and no insects or destroying birds
on this trip i tasted the first meat i had eaten since leaving earthlarge juicy steaks and chops from the wellfed domestic animals of the farms
also i enjoyed luscious fruits and vegetables but not a single article of food which was exactly similar to anything on earth
every plant and flower and vegetable and animal has been so refined by ages of careful scientific cultivation and breeding that the like of them on earth dwindled into pale gray characterless nothingness by comparison
at a second stop i met some highly cultivated people of the noble class and while in conversation we chanced to speak of helium
one of the older men had been there on a diplomatic mission several years before and spoke with regret of the conditions which seemed destined ever to keep these two countries at war
helium he said rightly boasts the most beautiful women of barsoom and of all her treasures the wondrous daughter of mors kajak dejah thoris is the most exquisite flower
why he added the people really worship the ground she walks upon and since her loss on that illstarred expedition all helium has been draped in mourning
that our ruler should have attacked the disabled fleet as it was returning to helium was but another of his awful blunders which i fear will sooner or later compel zodanga to elevate a wiser man to his place
even now though our victorious armies are surrounding helium the people of zodanga are voicing their displeasure for the war is not a popular one since it is not based on right or justice
our forces took advantage of the absence of the principal fleet of helium on their search for the princess and so we have been able easily to reduce the city to a sorry plight
it is said she will fall within the next few passages of the further moon
and what think you may have been the fate of the princess dejah thoris
i asked as casually as possible
she is dead he answered
this much was learned from a green warrior recently captured by our forces in the south
she escaped from the hordes of thark with a strange creature of another world only to fall into the hands of the warhoons
their thoats were found wandering upon the sea bottom and evidences of a bloody conflict were discovered nearby
while this information was in no way reassuring neither was it at all conclusive proof of the death of dejah thoris and so i determined to make every effort possible to reach helium as quickly as i could and carry to tardos mors such news of his granddaughter's possible whereabouts as lay in my power
ten days after leaving the three ptor brothers i arrived at zodanga
from the moment that i had come in contact with the red inhabitants of mars i had noticed that woola drew a great amount of unwelcome attention to me since the huge brute belonged to a species which is never domesticated by the red men
were one to stroll down broadway with a numidian lion at his heels the effect would be somewhat similar to that which i should have produced had i entered zodanga with woola
the very thought of parting with the faithful fellow caused me so great regret and genuine sorrow that i put it off until just before we arrived at the city's gates but then finally it became imperative that we separate
had nothing further than my own safety or pleasure been at stake no argument could have prevailed upon me to turn away the one creature upon barsoom that had never failed in a demonstration of affection and loyalty but as i would willingly have offered my life in the service of her in search of whom i was about to challenge the unknown dangers of this to me mysterious city i could not permit even woola's life to threaten the success of my venture much less his momentary happiness for i doubted not he soon would forget me
and so i bade the poor beast an affectionate farewell promising him however that if i came through my adventure in safety that in some way i should find the means to search him out
he seemed to understand me fully and when i pointed back in the direction of thark he turned sorrowfully away nor could i bear to watch him go but resolutely set my face toward zodanga and with a touch of heartsickness approached her frowning walls
the letter i bore from them gained me immediate entrance to the vast walled city
it was still very early in the morning and the streets were practically deserted
the residences raised high upon their metal columns resembled huge rookeries while the uprights themselves presented the appearance of steel tree trunks
the shops as a rule were not raised from the ground nor were their doors bolted or barred since thievery is practically unknown upon barsoom
assassination is the everpresent fear of all barsoomians and for this reason alone their homes are raised high above the ground at night or in times of danger
the ptor brothers had given me explicit directions for reaching the point of the city where i could find living accommodations and be near the offices of the government agents to whom they had given me letters
my way led to the central square or plaza which is a characteristic of all martian cities
the plaza of zodanga covers a square mile and is bounded by the palaces of the jeddak the jeds and other members of the royalty and nobility of zodanga as well as by the principal public buildings cafes and shops
as i was crossing the great square lost in wonder and admiration of the magnificent architecture and the gorgeous scarlet vegetation which carpeted the broad lawns i discovered a red martian walking briskly toward me from one of the avenues
he paid not the slightest attention to me but as he came abreast i recognized him and turning i placed my hand upon his shoulder calling out  kaor kantos kan
like lightning he wheeled and before i could so much as lower my hand the point of his longsword was at my breast
who are you
he growled and then as a backward leap carried me fifty feet from his sword he dropped the point to the ground and exclaimed laughing  i do not need a better reply there is but one man upon all barsoom who can bounce about like a rubber ball
by the mother of the further moon john carter how came you here and have you become a darseen that you can change your color at will
you gave me a bad half minute my friend he continued after i had briefly outlined my adventures since parting with him in the arena at warhoon
were my name and city known to the zodangans i would shortly be sitting on the banks of the lost sea of korus with my revered and departed ancestors
i am here in the interest of tardos mors jeddak of helium to discover the whereabouts of dejah thoris our princess
sab than prince of zodanga has her hidden in the city and has fallen madly in love with her
his father than kosis jeddak of zodanga has made her voluntary marriage to his son the price of peace between our countries but tardos mors will not accede to the demands and has sent word that he and his people would rather look upon the dead face of their princess than see her wed to any than her own choice and that personally he would prefer being engulfed in the ashes of a lost and burning helium to joining the metal of his house with that of than kosis
his reply was the deadliest affront he could have put upon than kosis and the zodangans but his people love him the more for it and his strength in helium is greater today than ever
i have been here three days continued kantos kan but i have not yet found where dejah thoris is imprisoned
today i join the zodangan navy as an air scout and i hope in this way to win the confidence of sab than the prince who is commander of this division of the navy and thus learn the whereabouts of dejah thoris
i am glad that you are here john carter for i know your loyalty to my princess and two of us working together should be able to accomplish much
the plaza was now commencing to fill with people going and coming upon the daily activities of their duties
the shops were opening and the cafes filling with early morning patrons
kantos kan led me to one of these gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely by mechanical apparatus
no hand touched the food from the time it entered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot and delicious upon the tables before the guests in response to the touching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires
after our meal kantos kan took me with him to the headquarters of the airscout squadron and introducing me to his superior asked that i be enrolled as a member of the corps
in accordance with custom an examination was necessary but kantos kan had told me to have no fear on this score as he would attend to that part of the matter
he accomplished this by taking my order for examination to the examining officer and representing himself as john carter
this ruse will be discovered later he cheerfully explained when they check up my weights measurements and other personal identification data but it will be several months before this is done and our mission should be accomplished or have failed long before that time
the next few days were spent by kantos kan in teaching me the intricacies of flying and of repairing the dainty little contrivances which the martians use for this purpose
the body of the oneman air craft is about sixteen feet long two feet wide and three inches thick tapering to a point at each end
the driver sits on top of this plane upon a seat constructed over the small noiseless radium engine which propels it
the medium of buoyancy is contained within the thin metal walls of the body and consists of the eighth barsoomian ray or ray of propulsion as it may be termed in view of its properties
this ray like the ninth ray is unknown on earth but the martians have discovered that it is an inherent property of all light no matter from what source it emanates
they have learned that it is the solar eighth ray which propels the light of the sun to the various planets and that it is the individual eighth ray of each planet which reflects or propels the light thus obtained out into space once more
the solar eighth ray would be absorbed by the surface of barsoom but the barsoomian eighth ray which tends to propel light from mars into space is constantly streaming out from the planet constituting a force of repulsion of gravity which when confined is able to lift enormous weights from the surface of the ground
it is this ray which has enabled them to so perfect aviation that battle ships far outweighing anything known upon earth sail as gracefully and lightly through the thin air of barsoom as a toy balloon in the heavy atmosphere of earth
during the early years of the discovery of this ray many strange accidents occurred before the martians learned to measure and control the wonderful power they had found
in one instance some nine hundred years before the first great battle ship to be built with eighth ray reservoirs was stored with too great a quantity of the rays and she had sailed up from helium with five hundred officers and men never to return
her power of repulsion for the planet was so great that it had carried her far into space where she can be seen today by the aid of powerful telescopes hurtling through the heavens ten thousand miles from mars a tiny satellite that will thus encircle barsoom to the end of time
the fourth day after my arrival at zodanga i made my first flight and as a result of it i won a promotion which included quarters in the palace of than kosis
as i rose above the city i circled several times as i had seen kantos kan do and then throwing my engine into top speed i raced at terrific velocity toward the south following one of the great waterways which enter zodanga from that direction
i had traversed perhaps two hundred miles in a little less than an hour when i descried far below me a party of three green warriors racing madly toward a small figure on foot which seemed to be trying to reach the confines of one of the walled fields
dropping my machine rapidly toward them and circling to the rear of the warriors i soon saw that the object of their pursuit was a red martian wearing the metal of the scout squadron to which i was attached
a short distance away lay his tiny flier surrounded by the tools with which he had evidently been occupied in repairing some damage when surprised by the green warriors
they were now almost upon him their flying mounts charging down on the relatively puny figure at terrific speed while the warriors leaned low to the right with their great metalshod spears
each seemed striving to be the first to impale the poor zodangan and in another moment his fate would have been sealed had it not been for my timely arrival
driving my fleet air craft at high speed directly behind the warriors i soon overtook them and without diminishing my speed i rammed the prow of my little flier between the shoulders of the nearest
the impact sufficient to have torn through inches of solid steel hurled the fellow's headless body into the air over the head of his thoat where it fell sprawling upon the moss
the mounts of the other two warriors turned squealing in terror and bolted in opposite directions
reducing my speed i circled and came to the ground at the feet of the astonished zodangan
he was warm in his thanks for my timely aid and promised that my day's work would bring the reward it merited for it was none other than a cousin of the jeddak of zodanga whose life i had saved
we wasted no time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surely return as soon as they had gained control of their mounts
hastening to his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish the needed repairs and had almost completed them when we saw the two green monsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us
when they had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the air craft which had frightened them
the warriors finally dismounted and hobbling their animals advanced toward us on foot with drawn longswords
i advanced to meet the larger telling the zodangan to do the best he could with the other
finishing my man with almost no effort as had now from much practice become habitual with me i hastened to return to my new acquaintance whom i found indeed in desperate straits
he was wounded and down with the huge foot of his antagonist upon his throat and the great longsword raised to deal the final thrust
with a bound i cleared the fifty feet intervening between us and with outstretched point drove my sword completely through the body of the green warrior
his sword fell harmless to the ground and he sank limply upon the prostrate form of the zodangan
a cursory examination of the latter revealed no mortal injuries and after a brief rest he asserted that he felt fit to attempt the return voyage
he would have to pilot his own craft however as these frail vessels are not intended to convey but a single person
quickly completing the repairs we rose together into the still cloudless martian sky and at great speed and without further mishap returned to zodanga
as we neared the city we discovered a mighty concourse of civilians and troops assembled upon the plain before the city
the sky was black with naval vessels and private and public pleasure craft flying long streamers of gaycolored silks and banners and flags of odd and picturesque design
my companion signaled that i slow down and running his machine close beside mine suggested that we approach and watch the ceremony which he said was for the purpose of conferring honors on individual officers and men for bravery and other distinguished service
he then unfurled a little ensign which denoted that his craft bore a member of the royal family of zodanga and together we made our way through the maze of lowlying air vessels until we hung directly over the jeddak of zodanga and his staff
all were mounted upon the small domestic bull thoats of the red martians and their trappings and ornamentation bore such a quantity of gorgeously colored feathers that i could not but be struck with the startling resemblance the concourse bore to a band of the red indians of my own earth
one of the staff called the attention of than kosis to the presence of my companion above them and the ruler motioned for him to descend
as they waited for the troops to move into position facing the jeddak the two talked earnestly together the jeddak and his staff occasionally glancing up at me
i could not hear their conversation and presently it ceased and all dismounted as the last body of troops had wheeled into position before their emperor
a member of the staff advanced toward the troops and calling the name of a soldier commanded him to advance
the officer then recited the nature of the heroic act which had won the approval of the jeddak and the latter advanced and placed a metal ornament upon the left arm of the lucky man
ten men had been so decorated when the aide called out  john carter air scout
never in my life had i been so surprised but the habit of military discipline is strong within me and i dropped my little machine lightly to the ground and advanced on foot as i had seen the others do
as i halted before the officer he addressed me in a voice audible to the entire assemblage of troops and spectators
in recognition john carter he said of your remarkable courage and skill in defending the person of the cousin of the jeddak than kosis and singlehanded vanquishing three green warriors it is the pleasure of our jeddak to confer on you the mark of his esteem
than kosis then advanced toward me and placing an ornament upon me said  my cousin has narrated the details of your wonderful achievement which seems little short of miraculous and if you can so well defend a cousin of the jeddak how much better could you defend the person of the jeddak himself
you are therefore appointed a padwar of the guards and will be quartered in my palace hereafter
i thanked him and at his direction joined the members of his staff
after the ceremony i returned my machine to its quarters on the roof of the barracks of the airscout squadron and with an orderly from the palace to guide me i reported to the officer in charge of the palace
chapter xxii  i find dejah   the majordomo to whom i reported had been given instructions to station me near the person of the jeddak who in time of war is always in great danger of assassination as the rule that all is fair in war seems to constitute the entire ethics of martian conflict
he therefore escorted me immediately to the apartment in which than kosis then was
the ruler was engaged in conversation with his son sab than and several courtiers of his household and did not perceive my entrance
the walls of the apartment were completely hung with splendid tapestries which hid any windows or doors which may have pierced them
the room was lighted by imprisoned rays of sunshine held between the ceiling proper and what appeared to be a groundglass false ceiling a few inches below
my guide drew aside one of the tapestries disclosing a passage which encircled the room between the hangings and the walls of the chamber
within this passage i was to remain he said so long as than kosis was in the apartment
when he left i was to follow
my only duty was to guard the ruler and keep out of sight as much as possible
i would be relieved after a period of four hours
the majordomo then left me
the tapestries were of a strange weaving which gave the appearance of heavy solidity from one side but from my hiding place i could perceive all that took place within the room as readily as though there had been no curtain intervening
scarcely had i gained my post than the tapestry at the opposite end of the chamber separated and four soldiers of the guard entered surrounding a female figure
as they approached than kosis the soldiers fell to either side and there standing before the jeddak and not ten feet from me her beautiful face radiant with smiles was dejah thoris
sab than prince of zodanga advanced to meet her and hand in hand they approached close to the jeddak
than kosis looked up in surprise and rising saluted her
to what strange freak do i owe this visit from the princess of helium who two days ago with rare consideration for my pride assured me that she would prefer tal hajus the green thark to my son
dejah thoris only smiled the more and with the roguish dimples playing at the corners of her mouth she made answer  from the beginning of time upon barsoom it has been the prerogative of woman to change her mind as she listed and to dissemble in matters concerning her heart
that you will forgive than kosis as has your son
two days ago i was not sure of his love for me but now i am and i have come to beg of you to forget my rash words and to accept the assurance of the princess of helium that when the time comes she will wed sab than prince of zodanga
i am glad that you have so decided replied than kosis
it is far from my desire to push war further against the people of helium and your promise shall be recorded and a proclamation to my people issued forthwith
it were better than kosis interrupted dejah thoris that the proclamation wait the ending of this war
it would look strange indeed to my people and to yours were the princess of helium to give herself to her country's enemy in the midst of hostilities
cannot the war be ended at once
spoke sab than
it requires but the word of than kosis to bring peace
say it my father say the word that will hasten my happiness and end this unpopular strife
we shall see replied than kosis how the people of helium take to peace
i shall at least offer it to them
dejah thoris after a few words turned and left the apartment still followed by her guards
thus was the edifice of my brief dream of happiness dashed broken to the ground of reality
the woman for whom i had offered my life and from whose lips i had so recently heard a declaration of love for me had lightly forgotten my very existence and smilingly given herself to the son of her people's most hated enemy
although i had heard it with my own ears i could not believe it
i must search out her apartments and force her to repeat the cruel truth to me alone before i would be convinced and so i deserted my post and hastened through the passage behind the tapestries toward the door by which she had left the chamber
slipping quietly through this opening i discovered a maze of winding corridors branching and turning in every direction
running rapidly down first one and then another of them i soon became hopelessly lost and was standing panting against a side wall when i heard voices near me
apparently they were coming from the opposite side of the partition against which i leaned and presently i made out the tones of dejah thoris
i could not hear the words but i knew that i could not possibly be mistaken in the voice
moving on a few steps i discovered another passageway at the end of which lay a door
walking boldly forward i pushed into the room only to find myself in a small antechamber in which were the four guards who had accompanied her
one of them instantly arose and accosted me asking the nature of my business
i am from than kosis i replied and wish to speak privately with dejah thoris princess of helium
and your order
asked the fellow
i did not know what he meant but replied that i was a member of the guard and without waiting for a reply from him i strode toward the opposite door of the antechamber behind which i could hear dejah thoris conversing
but my entrance was not to be so easily accomplished
the guardsman stepped before me saying  no one comes from than kosis without carrying an order or the password
you must give me one or the other before you may pass
the only order i require my friend to enter where i will hangs at my side i answered tapping my longsword will you let me pass in peace or no
for reply he whipped out his own sword calling to the others to join him and thus the four stood with drawn weapons barring my further progress
you are not here by the order of than kosis cried the one who had first addressed me and not only shall you not enter the apartments of the princess of helium but you shall go back to than kosis under guard to explain this unwarranted temerity
throw down your sword you cannot hope to overcome four of us he added with a grim smile
my reply was a quick thrust which left me but three antagonists and i can assure you that they were worthy of my metal
they had me backed against the wall in no time fighting for my life
slowly i worked my way to a corner of the room where i could force them to come at me only one at a time and thus we fought upward of twenty minutes the clanging of steel on steel producing a veritable bedlam in the little room
the noise had brought dejah thoris to the door of her apartment and there she stood throughout the conflict with sola at her back peering over her shoulder
her face was set and emotionless and i knew that she did not recognize me nor did sola
finally a lucky cut brought down a second guardsman and then with only two opposing me i changed my tactics and rushed them down after the fashion of my fighting that had won me many a victory
the third fell within ten seconds after the second and the last lay dead upon the bloody floor a few moments later
they were brave men and noble fighters and it grieved me that i had been forced to kill them but i would have willingly depopulated all barsoom could i have reached the side of my dejah thoris in no other way
sheathing my bloody blade i advanced toward my martian princess who still stood mutely gazing at me without sign of recognition
who are you zodangan
she whispered
another enemy to harass me in my misery
i am a friend i answered a once cherished friend
no friend of helium's princess wears that metal she replied and yet the voice
i have heard it before it is notit cannot beno for he is dead
it is though my princess none other than john carter i said
do you not recognize even through paint and strange metal the heart of your chieftain
as i came close to her she swayed toward me with outstretched hands but as i reached to take her in my arms she drew back with a shudder and a little moan of misery
too late too late she grieved
o my chieftain that was and whom i thought dead had you but returned one little hour beforebut now it is too late too late
what do you mean dejah thoris
i cried
that you would not have promised yourself to the zodangan prince had you known that i lived
think you john carter that i would give my heart to you yesterday and today to another
i thought that it lay buried with your ashes in the pits of warhoon and so today i have promised my body to another to save my people from the curse of a victorious zodangan army
but i am not dead my princess
i have come to claim you and all zodanga cannot prevent it
it is too late john carter my promise is given and on barsoom that is final
the ceremonies which follow later are but meaningless formalities
they make the fact of marriage no more certain than does the funeral cortege of a jeddak again place the seal of death upon him
i am as good as married john carter
no longer may you call me your princess
no longer are you my chieftain
i know but little of your customs here upon barsoom dejah thoris but i do know that i love you and if you meant the last words you spoke to me that day as the hordes of warhoon were charging down upon us no other man shall ever claim you as his bride
you meant them then my princess and you mean them still
say that it is true
i meant them john carter she whispered
i cannot repeat them now for i have given myself to another
ah if you had only known our ways my friend she continued half to herself the promise would have been yours long months ago and you could have claimed me before all others
it might have meant the fall of helium but i would have given my empire for my tharkian chief
then aloud she said do you remember the night when you offended me
you called me your princess without having asked my hand of me and then you boasted that you had fought for me
you did not know and i should not have been offended i see that now
but there was no one to tell you what i could not that upon barsoom there are two kinds of women in the cities of the red men
the one they fight for that they may ask them in marriage the other kind they fight for also but never ask their hands
when a man has won a woman he may address her as his princess or in any of the several terms which signify possession
you had fought for me but had never asked me in marriage and so when you called me your princess you see she faltered i was hurt but even then john carter i did not repulse you as i should have done until you made it doubly worse by taunting me with having won me through combat
i do not need ask your forgiveness now dejah thoris i cried
you must know that my fault was of ignorance of your barsoomian customs
what i failed to do through implicit belief that my petition would be presumptuous and unwelcome i do now dejah thoris i ask you to be my wife and by all the virginian fighting blood that flows in my veins you shall be
no john carter it is useless she cried hopelessly i may never be yours while sab than lives
you have sealed his death warrant my princesssab than dies
nor that either she hastened to explain
i may not wed the man who slays my husband even in selfdefense
it is custom
we are ruled by custom upon barsoom
it is useless my friend
you must bear the sorrow with me
that at least we may share in common
that and the memory of the brief days among the tharks
you must go now nor ever see me again
goodbye my chieftain that was
disheartened and dejected i withdrew from the room but i was not entirely discouraged nor would i admit that dejah thoris was lost to me until the ceremony had actually been performed
as i wandered along the corridors i was as absolutely lost in the mazes of winding passageways as i had been before i discovered dejah thoris' apartments
i knew that my only hope lay in escape from the city of zodanga for the matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained and as i could never reach my original post without a guide suspicion would surely rest on me so soon as i was discovered wandering aimlessly through the palace
presently i came upon a spiral runway leading to a lower floor and this i followed downward for several stories until i reached the doorway of a large apartment in which were a number of guardsmen
the walls of this room were hung with transparent tapestries behind which i secreted myself without being apprehended
the conversation of the guardsmen was general and awakened no interest in me until an officer entered the room and ordered four of the men to relieve the detail who were guarding the princess of helium
now i knew my troubles would commence in earnest and indeed they were upon me all too soon for it seemed that the squad had scarcely left the guardroom before one of their number burst in again breathlessly crying that they had found their four comrades butchered in the antechamber
in a moment the entire palace was alive with people
guardsmen officers courtiers servants and slaves ran helterskelter through the corridors and apartments carrying messages and orders and searching for signs of the assassin
this was my opportunity and slim as it appeared i grasped it for as a number of soldiers came hurrying past my hiding place i fell in behind them and followed through the mazes of the palace until in passing through a great hall i saw the blessed light of day coming in through a series of larger windows
here i left my guides and slipping to the nearest window sought for an avenue of escape
the windows opened upon a great balcony which overlooked one of the broad avenues of zodanga
the ground was about thirty feet below and at a like distance from the building was a wall fully twenty feet high constructed of polished glass about a foot in thickness
to a red martian escape by this path would have appeared impossible but to me with my earthly strength and agility it seemed already accomplished
my only fear was in being detected before darkness fell for i could not make the leap in broad daylight while the court below and the avenue beyond were crowded with zodangans
accordingly i searched for a hiding place and finally found one by accident inside a huge hanging ornament which swung from the ceiling of the hall and about ten feet from the floor
into the capacious bowllike vase i sprang with ease and scarcely had i settled down within it than i heard a number of people enter the apartment
the group stopped beneath my hiding place and i could plainly overhear their every word
it is the work of heliumites said one of the men
yes o jeddak but how had they access to the palace
i could believe that even with the diligent care of your guardsmen a single enemy might reach the inner chambers but how a force of six or eight fighting men could have done so unobserved is beyond me
we shall soon know however for here comes the royal psychologist
another man now joined the group and after making his formal greetings to his ruler said  o mighty jeddak it is a strange tale i read in the dead minds of your faithful guardsmen
they were felled not by a number of fighting men but by a single opponent
he paused to let the full weight of this announcement impress his hearers and that his statement was scarcely credited was evidenced by the impatient exclamation of incredulity which escaped the lips of than kosis
what manner of weird tale are you bringing me notan
he cried
it is the truth my jeddak replied the psychologist
in fact the impressions were strongly marked on the brain of each of the four guardsmen
their antagonist was a very tall man wearing the metal of one of your own guardsmen and his fighting ability was little short of marvelous for he fought fair against the entire four and vanquished them by his surpassing skill and superhuman strength and endurance
though he wore the metal of zodanga my jeddak such a man was never seen before in this or any other country upon barsoom
the mind of the princess of helium whom i have examined and questioned was a blank to me she has perfect control and i could not read one iota of it
she said that she witnessed a portion of the encounter and that when she looked there was but one man engaged with the guardsmen a man whom she did not recognize as ever having seen
where is my erstwhile savior
spoke another of the party and i recognized the voice of the cousin of than kosis whom i had rescued from the green warriors
by the metal of my first ancestor he went on but the description fits him to perfection especially as to his fighting ability
where is this man
cried than kosis
have him brought to me at once
what know you of him cousin
it seemed strange to me now that i think upon it that there should have been such a fighting man in zodanga of whose name even we were ignorant before today
and his name too john carter who ever heard of such a name upon barsoom
word was soon brought that i was nowhere to be found either in the palace or at my former quarters in the barracks of the airscout squadron
kantos kan they had found and questioned but he knew nothing of my whereabouts and as to my past he had told them he knew as little since he had but recently met me during our captivity among the warhoons
keep your eyes on this other one commanded than kosis
he also is a stranger and likely as not they both hail from helium and where one is we shall sooner or later find the other
quadruple the air patrol and let every man who leaves the city by air or ground be subjected to the closest scrutiny
another messenger now entered with word that i was still within the palace walls
the likeness of every person who has entered or left the palace grounds today has been carefully examined concluded the fellow and not one approaches the likeness of this new padwar of the guards other than that which was recorded of him at the time he entered
then we will have him shortly commented than kosis contentedly and in the meanwhile we will repair to the apartments of the princess of helium and question her in regard to the affair
she may know more than she cared to divulge to you notan
come
they left the hall and as darkness had fallen without i slipped lightly from my hiding place and hastened to the balcony
few were in sight and choosing a moment when none seemed near i sprang quickly to the top of the glass wall and from there to the avenue beyond the palace grounds
chapter xxiii  lost in the sky   without effort at concealment i hastened to the vicinity of our quarters where i felt sure i should find kantos kan  as i neared the building i became more careful as i judged and rightly that the place would be guarded
several men in civilian metal loitered near the front entrance and in the rear were others
my only means of reaching unseen the upper story where our apartments were situated was through an adjoining building and after considerable maneuvering i managed to attain the roof of a shop several doors away
leaping from roof to roof i soon reached an open window in the building where i hoped to find the heliumite and in another moment i stood in the room before him
he was alone and showed no surprise at my coming saying he had expected me much earlier as my tour of duty must have ended some time since
i saw that he knew nothing of the events of the day at the palace and when i had enlightened him he was all excitement
the news that dejah thoris had promised her hand to sab than filled him with dismay
it cannot be he exclaimed
it is impossible
why no man in all helium but would prefer death to the selling of our loved princess to the ruling house of zodanga
she must have lost her mind to have assented to such an atrocious bargain
you who do not know how we of helium love the members of our ruling house cannot appreciate the horror with which i contemplate such an unholy alliance
what can be done john carter
he continued
you are a resourceful man
can you not think of some way to save helium from this disgrace
if i can come within sword's reach of sab than i answered i can solve the difficulty in so far as helium is concerned but for personal reasons i would prefer that another struck the blow that frees dejah thoris
kantos kan eyed me narrowly before he spoke
you love her
he said
does she know it
she knows it kantos kan and repulses me only because she is promised to sab than
the splendid fellow sprang to his feet and grasping me by the shoulder raised his sword on high exclaiming  and had the choice been left to me i could not have chosen a more fitting mate for the first princess of barsoom
here is my hand upon your shoulder john carter and my word that sab than shall go out at the point of my sword for the sake of my love for helium for dejah thoris and for you
this very night i shall try to reach his quarters in the palace
how
i asked
you are strongly guarded and a quadruple force patrols the sky
he bent his head in thought a moment then raised it with an air of confidence
i only need to pass these guards and i can do it he said at last
i know a secret entrance to the palace through the pinnacle of the highest tower
i fell upon it by chance one day as i was passing above the palace on patrol duty
in this work it is required that we investigate any unusual occurrence we may witness and a face peering from the pinnacle of the high tower of the palace was to me most unusual
i therefore drew near and discovered that the possessor of the peering face was none other than sab than
he was slightly put out at being detected and commanded me to keep the matter to myself explaining that the passage from the tower led directly to his apartments and was known only to him
if i can reach the roof of the barracks and get my machine i can be in sab than's quarters in five minutes but how am i to escape from this building guarded as you say it is
how well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded
i asked
there is usually but one man on duty there at night upon the roof
go to the roof of this building kantos kan and wait me there
without stopping to explain my plans i retraced my way to the street and hastened to the barracks
i did not dare to enter the building filled as it was with members of the airscout squadron who in common with all zodanga were on the lookout for me
the building was an enormous one rearing its lofty head fully a thousand feet into the air
but few buildings in zodanga were higher than these barracks though several topped it by a few hundred feet the docks of the great battleships of the line standing some fifteen hundred feet from the ground while the freight and passenger stations of the merchant squadrons rose nearly as high
it was a long climb up the face of the building and one fraught with much danger but there was no other way and so i essayed the task
the fact that barsoomian architecture is extremely ornate made the feat much simpler than i had anticipated since i found ornamental ledges and projections which fairly formed a perfect ladder for me all the way to the eaves of the building
here i met my first real obstacle
the eaves projected nearly twenty feet from the wall to which i clung and though i encircled the great building i could find no opening through them
the top floor was alight and filled with soldiers engaged in the pastimes of their kind i could not therefore reach the roof through the building
there was one slight desperate chance and that i decided i must takeit was for dejah thoris and no man has lived who would not risk a thousand deaths for such as she
clinging to the wall with my feet and one hand i unloosened one of the long leather straps of my trappings at the end of which dangled a great hook by which air sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of their craft for various purposes of repair and by means of which landing parties are lowered to the ground from the battleships
i swung this hook cautiously to the roof several times before it finally found lodgment gently i pulled on it to strengthen its hold but whether it would bear the weight of my body i did not know
it might be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof so that as my body swung out at the end of the strap it would slip off and launch me to the pavement a thousand feet below
an instant i hesitated and then releasing my grasp upon the supporting ornament i swung out into space at the end of the strap
far below me lay the brilliantly lighted streets the hard pavements and death
there was a little jerk at the top of the supporting eaves and a nasty slipping grating sound which turned me cold with apprehension then the hook caught and i was safe
clambering quickly aloft i grasped the edge of the eaves and drew myself to the surface of the roof above
as i gained my feet i was confronted by the sentry on duty into the muzzle of whose revolver i found myself looking
who are you and whence came you
he cried
i am an air scout friend and very near a dead one for just by the merest chance i escaped falling to the avenue below i replied
but how came you upon the roof man
no one has landed or come up from the building for the past hour
quick explain yourself or i call the guard
look you here sentry and you shall see how i came and how close a shave i had to not coming at all i answered turning toward the edge of the roof where twenty feet below at the end of my strap hung all my weapons
the fellow acting on impulse of curiosity stepped to my side and to his undoing for as he leaned to peer over the eaves i grasped him by his throat and his pistol arm and threw him heavily to the roof
the weapon dropped from his grasp and my fingers choked off his attempted cry for assistance
i gagged and bound him and then hung him over the edge of the roof as i myself had hung a few moments before
i knew it would be morning before he would be discovered and i needed all the time that i could gain
donning my trappings and weapons i hastened to the sheds and soon had out both my machine and kantos kan's
making his fast behind mine i started my engine and skimming over the edge of the roof i dove down into the streets of the city far below the plane usually occupied by the air patrol
in less than a minute i was settling safely upon the roof of our apartment beside the astonished kantos kan
i lost no time in explanation but plunged immediately into a discussion of our plans for the immediate future
it was decided that i was to try to make helium while kantos kan was to enter the palace and dispatch sab than
if successful he was then to follow me
he set my compass for me a clever little device which will remain steadfastly fixed upon any given point on the surface of barsoom and bidding each other farewell we rose together and sped in the direction of the palace which lay in the route which i must take to reach helium
as we neared the high tower a patrol shot down from above throwing its piercing searchlight full upon my craft and a voice roared out a command to halt following with a shot as i paid no attention to his hail
kantos kan dropped quickly into the darkness while i rose steadily and at terrific speed raced through the martian sky followed by a dozen of the airscout craft which had joined the pursuit and later by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and a battery of rapidfire guns
by twisting and turning my little machine now rising and now falling i managed to elude their searchlights most of the time but i was also losing ground by these tactics and so i decided to hazard everything on a straightaway course and leave the result to fate and the speed of my machine
kantos kan had shown me a trick of gearing which is known only to the navy of helium that greatly increased the speed of our machines so that i felt sure i could distance my pursuers if i could dodge their projectiles for a few moments
as i sped through the air the screeching of the bullets around me convinced me that only by a miracle could i escape but the die was cast and throwing on full speed i raced a straight course toward helium
gradually i left my pursuers further and further behind and i was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape when a welldirected shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft
the concussion nearly capsized her and with a sickening plunge she hurtled downward through the dark night
how far i fell before i regained control of the plane i do not know but i must have been very close to the ground when i started to rise again as i plainly heard the squealing of animals below me
rising again i scanned the heavens for my pursuers and finally making out their lights far behind me saw that they were landing evidently in search of me
not until their lights were no longer discernible did i venture to flash my little lamp upon my compass and then i found to my consternation that a fragment of the projectile had utterly destroyed my only guide as well as my speedometer
it was true i could follow the stars in the general direction of helium but without knowing the exact location of the city or the speed at which i was traveling my chances for finding it were slim
helium lies a thousand miles southwest of zodanga and with my compass intact i should have made the trip barring accidents in between four and five hours
as it turned out however morning found me speeding over a vast expanse of dead sea bottom after nearly six hours of continuous flight at high speed
presently a great city showed below me but it was not helium as that alone of all barsoomian metropolises consists in two immense circular walled cities about seventyfive miles apart and would have been easily distinguishable from the altitude at which i was flying
believing that i had come too far to the north and west i turned back in a southeasterly direction passing during the forenoon several other large cities but none resembling the description which kantos kan had given me of helium
in addition to the twincity formation of helium another distinguishing feature is the two immense towers one of vivid scarlet rising nearly a mile into the air from the center of one of the cities while the other of bright yellow and of the same height marks her sister
chapter xxiv  tars tarkas finds a friend   about noon i passed low over a great dead city of ancient mars and as i skimmed out across the plain beyond i came full upon several thousand green warriors engaged in a terrific battle
scarcely had i seen them than a volley of shots was directed at me and with the almost unfailing accuracy of their aim my little craft was instantly a ruined wreck sinking erratically to the ground
i fell almost directly in the center of the fierce combat among warriors who had not seen my approach so busily were they engaged in life and death struggles
the men were fighting on foot with longswords while an occasional shot from a sharpshooter on the outskirts of the conflict would bring down a warrior who might for an instant separate himself from the entangled mass
as my machine sank among them i realized that it was fight or die with good chances of dying in any event and so i struck the ground with drawn longsword ready to defend myself as i could
i fell beside a huge monster who was engaged with three antagonists and as i glanced at his fierce face filled with the light of battle i recognized tars tarkas the thark
he did not see me as i was a trifle behind him and just then the three warriors opposing him and whom i recognized as warhoons charged simultaneously
the mighty fellow made quick work of one of them but in stepping back for another thrust he fell over a dead body behind him and was down and at the mercy of his foes in an instant
quick as lightning they were upon him and tars tarkas would have been gathered to his fathers in short order had i not sprung before his prostrate form and engaged his adversaries
i had accounted for one of them when the mighty thark regained his feet and quickly settled the other
he gave me one look and a slight smile touched his grim lip as touching my shoulder he said  i would scarcely recognize you john carter but there is no other mortal upon barsoom who would have done what you have for me
i think i have learned that there is such a thing as friendship my friend
he said no more nor was there opportunity for the warhoons were closing in about us and together we fought shoulder to shoulder during all that long hot afternoon until the tide of battle turned and the remnant of the fierce warhoon horde fell back upon their thoats and fled into the gathering darkness
ten thousand men had been engaged in that titanic struggle and upon the field of battle lay three thousand dead
neither side asked or gave quarter nor did they attempt to take prisoners
on our return to the city after the battle we had gone directly to tars tarkas' quarters where i was left alone while the chieftain attended the customary council which immediately follows an engagement
as i sat awaiting the return of the green warrior i heard something move in an adjoining apartment and as i glanced up there rushed suddenly upon me a huge and hideous creature which bore me backward upon the pile of silks and furs upon which i had been reclining
it was woolafaithful loving woola
he had found his way back to thark and as tars tarkas later told me had gone immediately to my former quarters where he had taken up his pathetic and seemingly hopeless watch for my return
tal hajus knows that you are here john carter said tars tarkas on his return from the jeddak's quarters sarkoja saw and recognized you as we were returning
tal hajus has ordered me to bring you before him tonight
i have ten thoats john carter you may take your choice from among them and i will accompany you to the nearest waterway that leads to helium
tars tarkas may be a cruel green warrior but he can be a friend as well
come we must start
and when you return tars tarkas
i asked
the wild calots possibly or worse he replied
unless i should chance to have the opportunity i have so long waited of battling with tal hajus
we will stay tars tarkas and see tal hajus tonight
you shall not sacrifice yourself and it may be that tonight you can have the chance you wait
he objected strenuously saying that tal hajus often flew into wild fits of passion at the mere thought of the blow i had dealt him and that if ever he laid his hands upon me i would be subjected to the most horrible tortures
while we were eating i repeated to tars tarkas the story which sola had told me that night upon the sea bottom during the march to thark
he said but little but the great muscles of his face worked in passion and in agony at recollection of the horrors which had been heaped upon the only thing he had ever loved in all his cold cruel terrible existence
he no longer demurred when i suggested that we go before tal hajus only saying that he would like to speak to sarkoja first
at his request i accompanied him to her quarters and the look of venomous hatred she cast upon me was almost adequate recompense for any future misfortunes this accidental return to thark might bring me
sarkoja said tars tarkas forty years ago you were instrumental in bringing about the torture and death of a woman named gozava
i have just discovered that the warrior who loved that woman has learned of your part in the transaction
he may not kill you sarkoja it is not our custom but there is nothing to prevent him tying one end of a strap about your neck and the other end to a wild thoat merely to test your fitness to survive and help perpetuate our race
having heard that he would do this on the morrow i thought it only right to warn you for i am a just man
the river iss is but a short pilgrimage sarkoja
come john carter
the next morning sarkoja was gone nor was she ever seen after
in silence we hastened to the jeddak's palace where we were immediately admitted to his presence in fact he could scarcely wait to see me and was standing erect upon his platform glowering at the entrance as i came in
strap him to that pillar he shrieked
we shall see who it is dares strike the mighty tal hajus
heat the irons with my own hands i shall burn the eyes from his head that he may not pollute my person with his vile gaze
chieftains of thark i cried turning to the assembled council and ignoring tal hajus i have been a chief among you and today i have fought for thark shoulder to shoulder with her greatest warrior
you owe me at least a hearing
i have won that much today
you claim to be a just people  silence roared tal hajus
gag the creature and bind him as i command
justice tal hajus exclaimed lorquas ptomel
who are you to set aside the customs of ages among the tharks
yes justice
echoed a dozen voices and so while tal hajus fumed and frothed i continued
you are a brave people and you love bravery but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today
i did not see him in the thick of battle he was not there
he rends defenseless women and little children in his lair but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men
why even i a midget beside him felled him with a single blow of my fist
is it of such that the tharks fashion their jeddaks
there stands beside me now a great thark a mighty warrior and a noble man
chieftains how sounds tars tarkas jeddak of thark
a roar of deeptoned applause greeted this suggestion
it but remains for this council to command and tal hajus must prove his fitness to rule
were he a brave man he would invite tars tarkas to combat for he does not love him but tal hajus is afraid tal hajus your jeddak is a coward
with my bare hands i could kill him and he knows it
after i ceased there was tense silence as all eyes were riveted upon tal hajus
he did not speak or move but the blotchy green of his countenance turned livid and the froth froze upon his lips
tal hajus said lorquas ptomel in a cold hard voice never in my long life have i seen a jeddak of the tharks so humiliated
there could be but one answer to this arraignment
we wait it
and still tal hajus stood as though petrified
chieftains continued lorquas ptomel shall the jeddak tal hajus prove his fitness to rule over tars tarkas
there were twenty chieftains about the rostrum and twenty swords flashed high in assent
there was no alternative
that decree was final and so tal hajus drew his longsword and advanced to meet tars tarkas
the combat was soon over and with his foot upon the neck of the dead monster tars tarkas became jeddak among the tharks
his first act was to make me a fullfledged chieftain with the rank i had won by my combats the first few weeks of my captivity among them
seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward tars tarkas as well as toward me i grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my cause against zodanga
i told tars tarkas the story of my adventures and in a few words had explained to him the thought i had in mind
john carter has made a proposal he said addressing the council which meets with my sanction
i shall put it to you briefly
dejah thoris the princess of helium who was our prisoner is now held by the jeddak of zodanga whose son she must wed to save her country from devastation at the hands of the zodangan forces
john carter suggests that we rescue her and return her to helium
the loot of zodanga would be magnificent and i have often thought that had we an alliance with the people of helium we could obtain sufficient assurance of sustenance to permit us to increase the size and frequency of our hatchings and thus become unquestionably supreme among the green men of all barsoom
what say you
it was a chance to fight an opportunity to loot and they rose to the bait as a speckled trout to a fly
for tharks they were wildly enthusiastic and before another half hour had passed twenty mounted messengers were speeding across dead sea bottoms to call the hordes together for the expedition
in three days we were on the march toward zodanga one hundred thousand strong as tars tarkas had been able to enlist the services of three smaller hordes on the promise of the great loot of zodanga
at the head of the column i rode beside the great thark while at the heels of my mount trotted my beloved woola
we traveled entirely by night timing our marches so that we camped during the day at deserted cities where even to the beasts we were all kept indoors during the daylight hours
on the march tars tarkas through his remarkable ability and statesmanship enlisted fifty thousand more warriors from various hordes so that ten days after we set out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of zodanga one hundred and fifty thousand strong
the fighting strength and efficiency of this horde of ferocious green monsters was equivalent to ten times their number of red men
never in the history of barsoom tars tarkas told me had such a force of green warriors marched to battle together
it was a monstrous task to keep even a semblance of harmony among them and it was a marvel to me that he got them to the city without a mighty battle among themselves
but as we neared zodanga their personal quarrels were submerged by their greater hatred for the red men and especially for the zodangans who had for years waged a ruthless campaign of extermination against the green men directing special attention toward despoiling their incubators
now that we were before zodanga the task of obtaining entry to the city devolved upon me and directing tars tarkas to hold his forces in two divisions out of earshot of the city with each division opposite a large gateway i took twenty dismounted warriors and approached one of the small gates that pierced the walls at short intervals
these gates have no regular guard but are covered by sentries who patrol the avenue that encircles the city just within the walls as our metropolitan police patrol their beats
the walls of zodanga are seventyfive feet in height and fifty feet thick
they are built of enormous blocks of carborundum and the task of entering the city seemed to my escort of green warriors an impossibility
the fellows who had been detailed to accompany me were of one of the smaller hordes and therefore did not know me
placing three of them with their faces to the wall and arms locked i commanded two more to mount to their shoulders and a sixth i ordered to climb upon the shoulders of the upper two
the head of the topmost warrior towered over forty feet from the ground
in this way with ten warriors i built a series of three steps from the ground to the shoulders of the topmost man
then starting from a short distance behind them i ran swiftly up from one tier to the next and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest i clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broad expanse
after me i dragged six lengths of leather from an equal number of my warriors
these lengths we had previously fastened together and passing one end to the topmost warrior i lowered the other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below
no one was in sight so lowering myself to the end of my leather strap i dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavement below
i had learned from kantos kan the secret of opening these gates and in another moment my twenty great fighting men stood within the doomed city of zodanga
i found to my delight that i had entered at the lower boundary of the enormous palace grounds
the building itself showed in the distance a blaze of glorious light and on the instant i determined to lead a detachment of warriors directly within the palace itself while the balance of the great horde was attacking the barracks of the soldiery
dispatching one of my men to tars tarkas for a detail of fifty tharks with word of my intentions i ordered ten warriors to capture and open one of the great gates while with the nine remaining i took the other
we were to do our work quietly no shots were to be fired and no general advance made until i had reached the palace with my fifty tharks
our plans worked to perfection
the two sentries we met were dispatched to their fathers upon the banks of the lost sea of korus and the guards at both gates followed them in silence
chapter xxv  the looting of zodanga   as the great gate where i stood swung open my fifty tharks headed by tars tarkas himself rode in upon their mighty thoats
i led them to the palace walls which i negotiated easily without assistance
once inside however the gate gave me considerable trouble but i finally was rewarded by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges and soon my fierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of zodanga
as we approached the palace i could see through the great windows of the first floor into the brilliantly illuminated audience chamber of than kosis
the immense hall was crowded with nobles and their women as though some important function was in progress
there was not a guard in sight without the palace due i presume to the fact that the city and palace walls were considered impregnable and so i came close and peered within
at one end of the chamber upon massive golden thrones encrusted with diamonds sat than kosis and his consort surrounded by officers and dignitaries of state
before them stretched a broad aisle lined on either side with soldiery and as i looked there entered this aisle at the far end of the hall the head of a procession which advanced to the foot of the throne
first there marched four officers of the jeddak's guard bearing a huge salver on which reposed upon a cushion of scarlet silk a great golden chain with a collar and padlock at each end
directly behind these officers came four others carrying a similar salver which supported the magnificent ornaments of a prince and princess of the reigning house of zodanga
at the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle
then came more dignitaries and the officers of the palace and of the army and finally two figures entirely muffled in scarlet silk so that not a feature of either was discernible
these two stopped at the foot of the throne facing than kosis
when the balance of the procession had entered and assumed their stations than kosis addressed the couple standing before him
i could not hear his words but presently two officers advanced and removed the scarlet robe from one of the figures and i saw that kantos kan had failed in his mission for it was sab than prince of zodanga who stood revealed before me
than kosis now took a set of the ornaments from one of the salvers and placed one of the collars of gold about his son's neck springing the padlock fast
after a few more words addressed to sab than he turned to the other figure from which the officers now removed the enshrouding silks disclosing to my now comprehending view dejah thoris princess of helium
the object of the ceremony was clear to me in another moment dejah thoris would be joined forever to the prince of zodanga
it was an impressive and beautiful ceremony i presume but to me it seemed the most fiendish sight i had ever witnessed and as the ornaments were adjusted upon her beautiful figure and her collar of gold swung open in the hands of than kosis i raised my longsword above my head and with the heavy hilt i shattered the glass of the great window and sprang into the midst of the astonished assemblage
with a bound i was on the steps of the platform beside than kosis and as he stood riveted with surprise i brought my longsword down upon the golden chain that would have bound dejah thoris to another
in an instant all was confusion a thousand drawn swords menaced me from every quarter and sab than sprang upon me with a jeweled dagger he had drawn from his nuptial ornaments
i could have killed him as easily as i might a fly but the ageold custom of barsoom stayed my hand and grasping his wrist as the dagger flew toward my heart i held him as though in a vise and with my longsword pointed to the far end of the hall
zodanga has fallen i cried
look
all eyes turned in the direction i had indicated and there forging through the portals of the entranceway rode tars tarkas and his fifty warriors on their great thoats
a cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage but no word of fear and in a moment the soldiers and nobles of zodanga were hurling themselves upon the advancing tharks
thrusting sab than headlong from the platform i drew dejah thoris to my side
behind the throne was a narrow doorway and in this than kosis now stood facing me with drawn longsword
in an instant we were engaged and i found no mean antagonist
as we circled upon the broad platform i saw sab than rushing up the steps to aid his father but as he raised his hand to strike dejah thoris sprang before him and then my sword found the spot that made sab than jeddak of zodanga
as his father rolled dead upon the floor the new jeddak tore himself free from dejah thoris' grasp and again we faced each other
he was soon joined by a quartet of officers and with my back against a golden throne i fought once again for dejah thoris
i was hard pressed to defend myself and yet not strike down sab than and with him my last chance to win the woman i loved
my blade was swinging with the rapidity of lightning as i sought to parry the thrusts and cuts of my opponents
two i had disarmed and one was down when several more rushed to the aid of their new ruler and to avenge the death of the old
as they advanced there were cries of the woman
the woman
strike her down it is her plot
kill her
kill her
calling to dejah thoris to get behind me i worked my way toward the little doorway back of the throne but the officers realized my intentions and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position where i could have defended dejah thoris against an army of swordsmen
the tharks were having their hands full in the center of the room and i began to realize that nothing short of a miracle could save dejah thoris and myself when i saw tars tarkas surging through the crowd of pygmies that swarmed about him
with one swing of his mighty longsword he laid a dozen corpses at his feet and so he hewed a pathway before him until in another moment he stood upon the platform beside me dealing death and destruction right and left
the bravery of the zodangans was aweinspiring not one attempted to escape and when the fighting ceased it was because only tharks remained alive in the great hall other than dejah thoris and myself
sab than lay dead beside his father and the corpses of the flower of zodangan nobility and chivalry covered the floor of the bloody shambles
my first thought when the battle was over was for kantos kan and leaving dejah thoris in charge of tars tarkas i took a dozen warriors and hastened to the dungeons beneath the palace
the jailers had all left to join the fighters in the throne room so we searched the labyrinthine prison without opposition
i called kantos kan's name aloud in each new corridor and compartment and finally i was rewarded by hearing a faint response
guided by the sound we soon found him helpless in a dark recess
he was overjoyed at seeing me and to know the meaning of the fight faint echoes of which had reached his prison cell
he told me that the air patrol had captured him before he reached the high tower of the palace so that he had not even seen sab than
we discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut away the bars and chains which held him prisoner so at his suggestion i returned to search the bodies on the floor above for keys to open the padlocks of his cell and of his chains
fortunately among the first i examined i found his jailer and soon we had kantos kan with us in the throne room
the sounds of heavy firing mingled with shouts and cries came to us from the city's streets and tars tarkas hastened away to direct the fighting without
kantos kan accompanied him to act as guide the green warriors commencing a thorough search of the palace for other zodangans and for loot and dejah thoris and i were left alone
she had sunk into one of the golden thrones and as i turned to her she greeted me with a wan smile
was there ever such a man
she exclaimed
i know that barsoom has never before seen your like
can it be that all earth men are as you
alone a stranger hunted threatened persecuted you have done in a few short months what in all the past ages of barsoom no man has ever done joined together the wild hordes of the sea bottoms and brought them to fight as allies of a red martian people
the answer is easy dejah thoris i replied smiling
it was not i who did it it was love love for dejah thoris a power that would work greater miracles than this you have seen
a pretty flush overspread her face and she answered  you may say that now john carter and i may listen for i am free
and more still i have to say ere it is again too late i returned
i have done many strange things in my life many things that wiser men would not have dared but never in my wildest fancies have i dreamed of winning a dejah thoris for myselffor never had i dreamed that in all the universe dwelt such a woman as the princess of helium
that you are a princess does not abash me but that you are you is enough to make me doubt my sanity as i ask you my princess to be mine
he does not need to be abashed who so well knew the answer to his plea before the plea were made she replied rising and placing her dear hands upon my shoulders and so i took her in my arms and kissed her
and thus in the midst of a city of wild conflict filled with the alarms of war with death and destruction reaping their terrible harvest around her did dejah thoris princess of helium true daughter of mars the god of war promise herself in marriage to john carter gentleman of virginia
chapter xxvi  through carnage to joy   sometime later tars tarkas and kantos kan returned to report that zodanga had been completely reduced
her forces were entirely destroyed or captured and no further resistance was to be expected from within
several battleships had escaped but there were thousands of war and merchant vessels under guard of thark warriors
the lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among themselves so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could man as many vessels as possible with zodangan prisoners and make for helium without further loss of time
five hours later we sailed from the roofs of the dock buildings with a fleet of two hundred and fifty battleships carrying nearly one hundred thousand green warriors followed by a fleet of transports with our thoats
behind us we left the stricken city in the fierce and brutal clutches of some forty thousand green warriors of the lesser hordes
they were looting murdering and fighting amongst themselves
in a hundred places they had applied the torch and columns of dense smoke were rising above the city as though to blot out from the eye of heaven the horrid sights beneath
in the middle of the afternoon we sighted the scarlet and yellow towers of helium and a short time later a great fleet of zodangan battleships rose from the camps of the besiegers without the city and advanced to meet us
the banners of helium had been strung from stem to stern of each of our mighty craft but the zodangans did not need this sign to realize that we were enemies for our green martian warriors had opened fire upon them almost as they left the ground
with their uncanny marksmanship they raked the oncoming fleet with volley after volley
the twin cities of helium perceiving that we were friends sent out hundreds of vessels to aid us and then began the first real air battle i had ever witnessed
the vessels carrying our green warriors were kept circling above the contending fleets of helium and zodanga since their batteries were useless in the hands of the tharks who having no navy have no skill in naval gunnery
their smallarm fire however was most effective and the final outcome of the engagement was strongly influenced if not wholly determined by their presence
at first the two forces circled at the same altitude pouring broadside after broadside into each other
presently a great hole was torn in the hull of one of the immense battle craft from the zodangan camp with a lurch she turned completely over the little figures of her crew plunging turning and twisting toward the ground a thousand feet below then with sickening velocity she tore after them almost completely burying herself in the soft loam of the ancient sea bottom
a wild cry of exultation arose from the heliumite squadron and with redoubled ferocity they fell upon the zodangan fleet
by a pretty maneuver two of the vessels of helium gained a position above their adversaries from which they poured upon them from their keel bomb batteries a perfect torrent of exploding bombs
then one by one the battleships of helium succeeded in rising above the zodangans and in a short time a number of the beleaguering battleships were drifting hopeless wrecks toward the high scarlet tower of greater helium
several others attempted to escape but they were soon surrounded by thousands of tiny individual fliers and above each hung a monster battleship of helium ready to drop boarding parties upon their decks
within but little more than an hour from the moment the victorious zodangan squadron had risen to meet us from the camp of the besiegers the battle was over and the remaining vessels of the conquered zodangans were headed toward the cities of helium under prize crews
there was an extremely pathetic side to the surrender of these mighty fliers the result of an ageold custom which demanded that surrender should be signalized by the voluntary plunging to earth of the commander of the vanquished vessel
one after another the brave fellows holding their colors high above their heads leaped from the towering bows of their mighty craft to an awful death
not until the commander of the entire fleet took the fearful plunge thus indicating the surrender of the remaining vessels did the fighting cease and the useless sacrifice of brave men come to an end
we now signaled the flagship of helium's navy to approach and when she was within hailing distance i called out that we had the princess dejah thoris on board and that we wished to transfer her to the flagship that she might be taken immediately to the city
as the full import of my announcement bore in upon them a great cry arose from the decks of the flagship and a moment later the colors of the princess of helium broke from a hundred points upon her upper works
when the other vessels of the squadron caught the meaning of the signals flashed them they took up the wild acclaim and unfurled her colors in the gleaming sunlight
the flagship bore down upon us and as she swung gracefully to and touched our side a dozen officers sprang upon our decks
as their astonished gaze fell upon the hundreds of green warriors who now came forth from the fighting shelters they stopped aghast but at sight of kantos kan who advanced to meet them they came forward crowding about him
dejah thoris and i then advanced and they had no eyes for other than her
she received them gracefully calling each by name for they were men high in the esteem and service of her grandfather and she knew them well
lay your hands upon the shoulder of john carter she said to them turning toward me the man to whom helium owes her princess as well as her victory today
they were very courteous to me and said many kind and complimentary things but what seemed to impress them most was that i had won the aid of the fierce tharks in my campaign for the liberation of dejah thoris and the relief of helium
you owe your thanks more to another man than to me i said and here he is meet one of barsoom's greatest soldiers and statesmen tars tarkas jeddak of thark
with the same polished courtesy that had marked their manner toward me they extended their greetings to the great thark nor to my surprise was he much behind them in ease of bearing or in courtly speech
though not a garrulous race the tharks are extremely formal and their ways lend themselves amazingly to dignified and courtly manners
dejah thoris went aboard the flagship and was much put out that i would not follow but as i explained to her the battle was but partly won we still had the land forces of the besieging zodangans to account for and i would not leave tars tarkas until that had been accomplished
the commander of the naval forces of helium promised to arrange to have the armies of helium attack from the city in conjunction with our land attack and so the vessels separated and dejah thoris was borne in triumph back to the court of her grandfather tardos mors jeddak of helium
in the distance lay our fleet of transports with the thoats of the green warriors where they had remained during the battle
without landing stages it was to be a difficult matter to unload these beasts upon the open plain but there was nothing else for it and so we put out for a point about ten miles from the city and began the task
it was necessary to lower the animals to the ground in slings and this work occupied the remainder of the day and half the night
twice we were attacked by parties of zodangan cavalry but with little loss however and after darkness shut down they withdrew
as soon as the last thoat was unloaded tars tarkas gave the command to advance and in three parties we crept upon the zodangan camp from the north the south and the east
about a mile from the main camp we encountered their outposts and as had been prearranged accepted this as the signal to charge
with wild ferocious cries and amidst the nasty squealing of battleenraged thoats we bore down upon the zodangans
we did not catch them napping but found a wellentrenched battle line confronting us
time after time we were repulsed until toward noon i began to fear for the result of the battle
the zodangans numbered nearly a million fighting men gathered from pole to pole wherever stretched their ribbonlike waterways while pitted against them were less than a hundred thousand green warriors
the forces from helium had not arrived nor could we receive any word from them
just at noon we heard heavy firing all along the line between the zodangans and the cities and we knew then that our muchneeded reinforcements had come
again tars tarkas ordered the charge and once more the mighty thoats bore their terrible riders against the ramparts of the enemy
at the same moment the battle line of helium surged over the opposite breastworks of the zodangans and in another moment they were being crushed as between two millstones
nobly they fought but in vain
the plain before the city became a veritable shambles ere the last zodangan surrendered but finally the carnage ceased the prisoners were marched back to helium and we entered the greater city's gates a huge triumphal procession of conquering heroes
the broad avenues were lined with women and children among which were the few men whose duties necessitated that they remain within the city during the battle
we were greeted with an endless round of applause and showered with ornaments of gold platinum silver and precious jewels
the city had gone mad with joy
my fierce tharks caused the wildest excitement and enthusiasm
never before had an armed body of green warriors entered the gates of helium and that they came now as friends and allies filled the red men with rejoicing
that my poor services to dejah thoris had become known to the heliumites was evidenced by the loud crying of my name and by the loads of ornaments that were fastened upon me and my huge thoat as we passed up the avenues to the palace for even in the face of the ferocious appearance of woola the populace pressed close about me
as we approached this magnificent pile we were met by a party of officers who greeted us warmly and requested that tars tarkas and his jeds with the jeddaks and jeds of his wild allies together with myself dismount and accompany them to receive from tardos mors an expression of his gratitude for our services
at the top of the great steps leading up to the main portals of the palace stood the royal party and as we reached the lower steps one of their number descended to meet us
he was an almost perfect specimen of manhood tall straight as an arrow superbly muscled and with the carriage and bearing of a ruler of men
i did not need to be told that he was tardos mors jeddak of helium
the first member of our party he met was tars tarkas and his first words sealed forever the new friendship between the races
that tardos mors he said earnestly may meet the greatest living warrior of barsoom is a priceless honor but that he may lay his hand on the shoulder of a friend and ally is a far greater boon
jeddak of helium returned tars tarkas it has remained for a man of another world to teach the green warriors of barsoom the meaning of friendship to him we owe the fact that the hordes of thark can understand you that they can appreciate and reciprocate the sentiments so graciously expressed
tardos mors then greeted each of the green jeddaks and jeds and to each spoke words of friendship and appreciation
as he approached me he laid both hands upon my shoulders
welcome my son he said that you are granted gladly and without one word of opposition the most precious jewel in all helium yes on all barsoom is sufficient earnest of my esteem
we were then presented to mors kajak jed of lesser helium and father of dejah thoris
he had followed close behind tardos mors and seemed even more affected by the meeting than had his father
he tried a dozen times to express his gratitude to me but his voice choked with emotion and he could not speak and yet he had as i was to later learn a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a fighter that was remarkable even upon warlike barsoom
in common with all helium he worshiped his daughter nor could he think of what she had escaped without deep emotion
chapter xxvii  from joy to death   for ten days the hordes of thark and their wild allies were feasted and entertained and then loaded with costly presents and escorted by ten thousand soldiers of helium commanded by mors kajak they started on the return journey to their own lands
the jed of lesser helium with a small party of nobles accompanied them all the way to thark to cement more closely the new bonds of peace and friendship
sola also accompanied tars tarkas her father who before all his chieftains had acknowledged her as his daughter
three weeks later mors kajak and his officers accompanied by tars tarkas and sola returned upon a battleship that had been dispatched to thark to fetch them in time for the ceremony which made dejah thoris and john carter one
for nine years i served in the councils and fought in the armies of helium as a prince of the house of tardos mors
the people seemed never to tire of heaping honors upon me and no day passed that did not bring some new proof of their love for my princess the incomparable dejah thoris
in a golden incubator upon the roof of our palace lay a snowwhite egg
for nearly five years ten soldiers of the jeddak's guard had constantly stood over it and not a day passed when i was in the city that dejah thoris and i did not stand hand in hand before our little shrine planning for the future when the delicate shell should break
vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we sat there talking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives together and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes
in the distance we saw the brightwhite light of an approaching airship but we attached no special significance to so common a sight
like a bolt of lightning it raced toward helium until its very speed bespoke the unusual
flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer for the jeddak it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy patrol boat which must convoy it to the palace docks
ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message called me to the council chamber which i found filling with the members of that body
on the raised platform of the throne was tardos mors pacing back and forth with tensedrawn face
when all were in their seats he turned toward us
this morning he said word reached the several governments of barsoom that the keeper of the atmosphere plant had made no wireless report for two days nor had almost ceaseless calls upon him from a score of capitals elicited a sign of response
the ambassadors of the other nations asked us to take the matter in hand and hasten the assistant keeper to the plant
all day a thousand cruisers have been searching for him until just now one of them returns bearing his dead body which was found in the pits beneath his house horribly mutilated by some assassin
i do not need to tell you what this means to barsoom
it would take months to penetrate those mighty walls in fact the work has already commenced and there would be little to fear were the engine of the pumping plant to run as it should and as they all have for hundreds of years but the worst we fear has happened
the instruments show a rapidly decreasing air pressure on all parts of barsoomthe engine has stopped
my gentlemen he concluded we have at best three days to live
there was absolute silence for several minutes and then a young noble arose and with his drawn sword held high above his head addressed tardos mors
the men of helium have prided themselves that they have ever shown barsoom how a nation of red men should live now is our opportunity to show them how they should die
let us go about our duties as though a thousand useful years still lay before us
the chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing better to do than to allay the fears of the people by our example we went our ways with smiles upon our faces and sorrow gnawing at our hearts
when i returned to my palace i found that the rumor already had reached dejah thoris so i told her all that i had heard
we have been very happy john carter she said and i thank whatever fate overtakes us that it permits us to die together
the next two days brought no noticeable change in the supply of air but on the morning of the third day breathing became difficult at the higher altitudes of the rooftops
the avenues and plazas of helium were filled with people
all business had ceased
for the most part the people looked bravely into the face of their unalterable doom
here and there however men and women gave way to quiet grief
toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced to succumb and within an hour the people of barsoom were sinking by thousands into the unconsciousness which precedes death by asphyxiation
dejah thoris and i with the other members of the royal family had collected in a sunken garden within an inner courtyard of the palace
we conversed in low tones when we conversed at all as the awe of the grim shadow of death crept over us
even woola seemed to feel the weight of the impending calamity for he pressed close to dejah thoris and to me whining pitifully
the little incubator had been brought from the roof of our palace at request of dejah thoris and she sat gazing longingly upon the unknown little life that now she would never know
as it was becoming perceptibly difficult to breathe tardos mors arose saying  let us bid each other farewell
the days of the greatness of barsoom are over
tomorrow's sun will look down upon a dead world which through all eternity must go swinging through the heavens peopled not even by memories
it is the end
he stooped and kissed the women of his family and laid his strong hand upon the shoulders of the men
as i turned sadly from him my eyes fell upon dejah thoris
her head was drooping upon her breast to all appearances she was lifeless
with a cry i sprang to her and raised her in my arms
her eyes opened and looked into mine
kiss me john carter she murmured
i love you
i love you
it is cruel that we must be torn apart who were just starting upon a life of love and happiness
as i pressed her dear lips to mine the old feeling of unconquerable power and authority rose in me
the fighting blood of virginia sprang to life in my veins
it shall not be my princess i cried
there is there must be some way and john carter who has fought his way through a strange world for love of you will find it
and with my words there crept above the threshold of my conscious mind a series of nine long forgotten sounds
like a flash of lightning in the darkness their full purport dawned upon methe key to the three great doors of the atmosphere plant
turning suddenly toward tardos mors as i still clasped my dying love to my breast i cried
a flier jeddak
quick
order your swiftest flier to the palace top
i can save barsoom yet
he did not wait to question but in an instant a guard was racing to the nearest dock and though the air was thin and almost gone at the rooftop they managed to launch the fastest oneman airscout machine that the skill of barsoom had ever produced
kissing dejah thoris a dozen times and commanding woola who would have followed me to remain and guard her i bounded with my old agility and strength to the high ramparts of the palace and in another moment i was headed toward the goal of the hopes of all barsoom
i had to fly low to get sufficient air to breathe but i took a straight course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise only a few feet above the ground
i traveled with awful velocity for my errand was a race against time with death
the face of dejah thoris hung always before me
as i turned for a last look as i left the palace garden i had seen her stagger and sink upon the ground beside the little incubator
that she had dropped into the last coma which would end in death if the air supply remained unreplenished i well knew and so throwing caution to the winds i flung overboard everything but the engine and compass even to my ornaments and lying on my belly along the deck with one hand on the steering wheel and the other pushing the speed lever to its last notch i split the thin air of dying mars with the speed of a meteor
an hour before dark the great walls of the atmosphere plant loomed suddenly before me and with a sickening thud i plunged to the ground before the small door which was withholding the spark of life from the inhabitants of an entire planet
beside the door a great crew of men had been laboring to pierce the wall but they had scarcely scratched the flintlike surface and now most of them lay in the last sleep from which not even air would awaken them
conditions seemed much worse here than at helium and it was with difficulty that i breathed at all
there were a few men still conscious and to one of these i spoke
if i can open these doors is there a man who can start the engines
i asked
i can he replied if you open quickly
i can last but a few moments more
but it is useless they are both dead and no one else upon barsoom knew the secret of these awful locks
for three days men crazed with fear have surged about this portal in vain attempts to solve its mystery
i had no time to talk i was becoming very weak and it was with difficulty that i controlled my mind at all
but with a final effort as i sank weakly to my knees i hurled the nine thought waves at that awful thing before me
the martian had crawled to my side and with staring eyes fixed on the single panel before us we waited in the silence of death
slowly the mighty door receded before us
i attempted to rise and follow it but i was too weak
after it i cried to my companion and if you reach the pump room turn loose all the pumps
it is the only chance barsoom has to exist tomorrow
from where i lay i opened the second door and then the third and as i saw the hope of barsoom crawling weakly on hands and knees through the last doorway i sank unconscious upon the ground
chapter xxviii  at the arizona cave   it was dark when i opened my eyes again
strange stiff garments were upon my body garments that cracked and powdered away from me as i rose to a sitting posture
i felt myself over from head to foot and from head to foot i was clothed though when i fell unconscious at the little doorway i had been naked
before me was a small patch of moonlit sky which showed through a ragged aperture
as my hands passed over my body they came in contact with pockets and in one of these a small parcel of matches wrapped in oiled paper
one of these matches i struck and its dim flame lighted up what appeared to be a huge cave toward the back of which i discovered a strange still figure huddled over a tiny bench
as i approached it i saw that it was the dead and mummified remains of a little old woman with long black hair and the thing it leaned over was a small charcoal burner upon which rested a round copper vessel containing a small quantity of greenish powder
behind her depending from the roof upon rawhide thongs and stretching entirely across the cave was a row of human skeletons
from the thong which held them stretched another to the dead hand of the little old woman as i touched the cord the skeletons swung to the motion with a noise as of the rustling of dry leaves
it was a most grotesque and horrid tableau and i hastened out into the fresh air glad to escape from so gruesome a place
the sight that met my eyes as i stepped out upon a small ledge which ran before the entrance of the cave filled me with consternation
a new heaven and a new landscape met my gaze
the silvered mountains in the distance the almost stationary moon hanging in the sky the cactistudded valley below me were not of mars
i could scarce believe my eyes but the truth slowly forced itself upon mei was looking upon arizona from the same ledge from which ten years before i had gazed with longing upon mars
burying my head in my arms i turned broken and sorrowful down the trail from the cave
above me shone the red eye of mars holding her awful secret fortyeight million miles away
did the martian reach the pump room
did the vitalizing air reach the people of that distant planet in time to save them
was my dejah thoris alive or did her beautiful body lie cold in death beside the tiny golden incubator in the sunken garden of the inner courtyard of the palace of tardos mors the jeddak of helium
for ten years i have waited and prayed for an answer to my questions
for ten years i have waited and prayed to be taken back to the world of my lost love
i would rather lie dead beside her there than live on earth all those millions of terrible miles from her
the old mine which i found untouched has made me fabulously wealthy but what care i for wealth
as i sit here tonight in my little study overlooking the hudson just twenty years have elapsed since i first opened my eyes upon mars
i can see her shining in the sky through the little window by my desk and tonight she seems calling to me again as she has not called before since that long dead night and i think i can see across that awful abyss of space a beautiful blackhaired woman standing in the garden of a palace and at her side is a little boy who puts his arm around her as she points into the sky toward the planet earth while at their feet is a huge and hideous creature with a heart of gold
i believe that they are waiting there for me and something tells me that i shall soon know
chapter i  out to sea   i had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me or to any other
i may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale
when my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much and that i was prone to doubtfulness his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript and dry official records of the british colonial office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative
i do not say the story is true for i did not witness the happenings which it portrays but the fact that in the telling of it to you i have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it may be true
the yellow mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead and the records of the colonial office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host and so i give you the story as i painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies
if you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique remarkable and interesting
from the records of the colonial office and from the dead man's diary we learn that a certain young english nobleman whom we shall call john clayton lord greystoke was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a british west coast african colony from whose simple native inhabitants another european power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the congo and the aruwimi
the natives of the british colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises but that few if any ever returned to their families
the englishmen in africa went even further saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers and they were told that they had yet several years to serve
and so the colonial office appointed john clayton to a new post in british west africa but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black british subjects by the officers of a friendly european power
why he was sent is however of little moment to this story for he never made an investigation nor in fact did he ever reach his destination
clayton was the type of englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefieldsa strong virile manmentally morally and physically
in stature he was above the average height his eyes were gray his features regular and strong his carriage that of perfect robust health influenced by his years of army training
political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the colonial office and so we find him still young entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the queen
when he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled
the preferment seemed to him in the nature of a wellmerited reward for painstaking and intelligent service and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility but on the other hand he had been married to the hon
alice rutherford for scarce a three months and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical africa that appalled him
for her sake he would have refused the appointment but she would not have it so
instead she insisted that he accept and indeed take her with him
there were mothers and brothers and sisters and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject but as to what they severally advised history is silent
we know only that on a bright may morning in  john lord greystoke and lady alice sailed from dover on their way to africa
a month later they arrived at freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel the fuwalda which was to bear them to their final destination
and here john lord greystoke and lady alice his wife vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men
two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of freetown a half dozen british war vessels were scouring the south atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of st helena which convinced the world that the fuwalda had gone down with all on board and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years
the fuwalda a barkentine of about one hundred tons was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern atlantic their crews composed of the offscourings of the seaunhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation
the fuwalda was no exception to the rule
her officers were swarthy bullies hating and hated by their crew
the captain while a competent seaman was a brute in his treatment of his men
he knew or at least he used but two arguments in his dealings with thema belaying pin and a revolvernor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else
so it was that from the second day out from freetown john clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea
it was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man
two sailors were washing down the decks of the fuwalda the first mate was on duty and the captain had stopped to speak with john clayton and lady alice
the men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors
closer and closer they came until one of them was directly behind the captain
in another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded
but just that instant the officer turned to leave lord and lady greystoke and as he did so tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck overturning the waterpail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents
for an instant the scene was ludicrous but only for an instant
with a volley of awful oaths his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage the captain regained his feet and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck
the man was small and rather old so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated
the other seaman however was neither old nor smalla huge bear of a man with fierce black mustachios and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders
as he saw his mate go down he crouched and with a low snarl sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow
from scarlet the officer's face went white for this was mutiny and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career
without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him but quick as he was john clayton was almost as quick so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead for lord greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun
words passed between clayton and the captain the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and lady greystoke remained passengers
the captain was on the point of making an angry reply but thinking better of it turned on his heel and black and scowling strode aft
he did not care to antagonize an english official for the queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate and which he fearedengland's farreaching navy
the two sailors picked themselves up the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise
the big fellow who was known among his mates as black michael tried his leg gingerly and finding that it bore his weight turned to clayton with a word of gruff thanks
though the fellow's tone was surly his words were evidently well meant
ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation
they did not see him again for several days nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them
they took their meals in his cabin as they had before the unfortunate occurrence but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time
the other officers were coarse illiterate fellows but little above the villainous crew they bullied and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished english noble and his lady so that the claytons were left very much to themselves
this in itself accorded perfectly with their desires but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy
there was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that undefinable something which presages disaster
outwardly to the knowledge of the claytons all went on as before upon the little vessel but that there was an undertow leading them toward some unknown danger both felt though they did not speak of it to each other
on the second day after the wounding of black michael clayton came on deck just in time to see the limp body of one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate a heavy belaying pin in his hand stood glowering at the little party of sullen sailors
clayton asked no questionshe did not need toand the following day as the great lines of a british battleship grew out of the distant horizon he half determined to demand that he and lady alice be put aboard her for his fears were steadily increasing that nothing but harm could result from remaining on the lowering sullen fuwalda
toward noon they were within speaking distance of the british vessel but when clayton had nearly decided to ask the captain to put them aboard her the obvious ridiculousness of such a request became suddenly apparent
what reason could he give the officer commanding her majesty's ship for desiring to go back in the direction from which he had just come
what if he told them that two insubordinate seamen had been roughly handled by their officers
they would but laugh in their sleeves and attribute his reason for wishing to leave the ship to but one thingcowardice
john clayton lord greystoke did not ask to be transferred to the british manofwar
late in the afternoon he saw her upper works fade below the far horizon but not before he learned that which confirmed his greatest fears and caused him to curse the false pride which had restrained him from seeking safety for his young wife a few short hours before when safety was within reacha safety which was now gone forever
it was midafternoon that brought the little old sailor who had been felled by the captain a few days before to where clayton and his wife stood by the ship's side watching the ever diminishing outlines of the great battleship
the old fellow was polishing brasses and as he came edging along until close to clayton he said in an undertone  'ell's to pay sir on this 'ere craft an' mark my word for it sir
'ell's to pay
what do you mean my good fellow
asked clayton
wy hasn't ye seen wats goin' on
hasn't ye 'eard that devil's spawn of a capting an' is mates knockin' the bloomin' lights outen 'arf the crew
two busted 'eads yeste'day an' three today
black michael's as good as new agin an' 'e's not the bully to stand fer it not 'e an' mark my word for it sir
you mean my man that the crew contemplates mutiny
asked clayton
mutiny
exclaimed the old fellow
mutiny
they means murder sir an' mark my word for it sir
when
hit's comin' sir hit's comin' but i'm not asayin' wen an' i've said too damned much now but ye was a good sort t'other day an' i thought it no more'n right to warn ye
but keep a still tongue in yer 'ead an' when ye 'ear shootin' git below an' stay there
that's all only keep a still tongue in yer 'ead or they'll put a pill between yer ribs an' mark my word for it sir and the old fellow went on with his polishing which carried him away from where the claytons were standing
deuced cheerful outlook alice said clayton
you should warn the captain at once john
possibly the trouble may yet be averted she said
i suppose i should but yet from purely selfish motives i am almost prompted to 'keep a still tongue in my 'ead'
whatever they do now they will spare us in recognition of my stand for this fellow black michael but should they find that i had betrayed them there would be no mercy shown us alice
you have but one duty john and that lies in the interest of vested authority
if you do not warn the captain you are as much a party to whatever follows as though you had helped to plot and carry it out with your own head and hands
you do not understand dear replied clayton
it is of you i am thinkingthere lies my first duty
the captain has brought this condition upon himself so why then should i risk subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in a probably futile attempt to save him from his own brutal folly
you have no conception dear of what would follow were this pack of cutthroats to gain control of the fuwalda
duty is duty john and no amount of sophistries may change it
i would be a poor wife for an english lord were i to be responsible for his shirking a plain duty
i realize the danger which must follow but i can face it with you
have it as you will then alice he answered smiling
maybe we are borrowing trouble
while i do not like the looks of things on board this ship they may not be so bad after all for it is possible that the 'ancient mariner' was but voicing the desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking of real facts
mutiny on the high sea may have been common a hundred years ago but in this good year  it is the least likely of happenings
but there goes the captain to his cabin now
if i am going to warn him i might as well get the beastly job over for i have little stomach to talk with the brute at all
so saying he strolled carelessly in the direction of the companionway through which the captain had passed and a moment later was knocking at his door
come in growled the deep tones of that surly officer
and when clayton had entered and closed the door behind him  well
i have come to report the gist of a conversation i heard today because i feel that while there may be nothing to it it is as well that you be forearmed
in short the men contemplate mutiny and murder
it's a lie
roared the captain
and if you have been interfering again with the discipline of this ship or meddling in affairs that don't concern you you can take the consequences and be damned
i don't care whether you are an english lord or not
i'm captain of this here ship and from now on you keep your meddling nose out of my business
the captain had worked himself up to such a frenzy of rage that he was fairly purple of face and he shrieked the last words at the top of his voice emphasizing his remarks by a loud thumping of the table with one huge fist and shaking the other in clayton's face
greystoke never turned a hair but stood eying the excited man with level gaze
captain billings he drawled finally if you will pardon my candor i might remark that you are something of an ass
whereupon he turned and left the captain with the same indifferent ease that was habitual with him and which was more surely calculated to raise the ire of a man of billings' class than a torrent of invective
so whereas the captain might easily have been brought to regret his hasty speech had clayton attempted to conciliate him his temper was now irrevocably set in the mold in which clayton had left it and the last chance of their working together for their common good was gone
well alice said clayton as he rejoined his wife i might have saved my breath
the fellow proved most ungrateful
fairly jumped at me like a mad dog
he and his blasted old ship may hang for aught i care and until we are safely off the thing i shall spend my energies in looking after our own welfare
and i rather fancy the first step to that end should be to go to our cabin and look over my revolvers
i am sorry now that we packed the larger guns and the ammunition with the stuff below
they found their quarters in a bad state of disorder
clothing from their open boxes and bags strewed the little apartment and even their beds had been torn to pieces
evidently someone was more anxious about our belongings than we said clayton
let's have a look around alice and see what's missing
a thorough search revealed the fact that nothing had been taken but clayton's two revolvers and the small supply of ammunition he had saved out for them
those are the very things i most wish they had left us said clayton and the fact that they wished for them and them alone is most sinister
what are we to do john
asked his wife
perhaps you were right in that our best chance lies in maintaining a neutral position
if the officers are able to prevent a mutiny we have nothing to fear while if the mutineers are victorious our one slim hope lies in not having attempted to thwart or antagonize them
right you are alice
we'll keep in the middle of the road
as they started to straighten up their cabin clayton and his wife simultaneously noticed the corner of a piece of paper protruding from beneath the door of their quarters
as clayton stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move further into the room and then he realized that it was being pushed inward by someone from without
quickly and silently he stepped toward the door but as he reached for the knob to throw it open his wife's hand fell upon his wrist
no john she whispered
they do not wish to be seen and so we cannot afford to see them
do not forget that we are keeping to the middle of the road
clayton smiled and dropped his hand to his side
thus they stood watching the little bit of white paper until it finally remained at rest upon the floor just inside the door
then clayton stooped and picked it up
it was a bit of grimy white paper roughly folded into a ragged square
opening it they found a crude message printed almost illegibly and with many evidences of an unaccustomed task
translated it was a warning to the claytons to refrain from reporting the loss of the revolvers or from repeating what the old sailor had told themto refrain on pain of death
i rather imagine we'll be good said clayton with a rueful smile
about all we can do is to sit tight and wait for whatever may come
chapter ii  the savage home   nor did they have long to wait for the next morning as clayton was emerging on deck for his accustomed walk before breakfast a shot rang out and then another and another
the sight which met his eyes confirmed his worst fears
facing the little knot of officers was the entire motley crew of the fuwalda and at their head stood black michael
at the first volley from the officers the men ran for shelter and from points of vantage behind masts wheelhouse and cabin they returned the fire of the five men who represented the hated authority of the ship
two of their number had gone down before the captain's revolver
they lay where they had fallen between the combatants
but then the first mate lunged forward upon his face and at a cry of command from black michael the mutineers charged the remaining four
the crew had been able to muster but six firearms so most of them were armed with boat hooks axes hatchets and crowbars
the captain had emptied his revolver and was reloading as the charge was made
the second mate's gun had jammed and so there were but two weapons opposed to the mutineers as they bore down upon the officers who now started to give back before the infuriated rush of their men
both sides were cursing and swearing in a frightful manner which together with the reports of the firearms and the screams and groans of the wounded turned the deck of the fuwalda to the likeness of a madhouse
before the officers had taken a dozen backward steps the men were upon them
an ax in the hands of a burly negro cleft the captain from forehead to chin and an instant later the others were down dead or wounded from dozens of blows and bullet wounds
short and grisly had been the work of the mutineers of the fuwalda and through it all john clayton had stood leaning carelessly beside the companionway puffing meditatively upon his pipe as though he had been but watching an indifferent cricket match
as the last officer went down he thought it was time that he returned to his wife lest some members of the crew find her alone below
though outwardly calm and indifferent clayton was inwardly apprehensive and wrought up for he feared for his wife's safety at the hands of these ignorant halfbrutes into whose hands fate had so remorselessly thrown them
as he turned to descend the ladder he was surprised to see his wife standing on the steps almost at his side
how long have you been here alice
since the beginning she replied
how awful john
oh how awful
what can we hope for at the hands of such as those
breakfast i hope he answered smiling bravely in an attempt to allay her fears
at least he added i'm going to ask them
come with me alice
we must not let them think we expect any but courteous treatment
the men had by this time surrounded the dead and wounded officers and without either partiality or compassion proceeded to throw both living and dead over the sides of the vessel
with equal heartlessness they disposed of their own dead and dying
presently one of the crew spied the approaching claytons and with a cry of  here's two more for the fishes rushed toward them with uplifted ax
but black michael was even quicker so that the fellow went down with a bullet in his back before he had taken a half dozen steps
with a loud roar black michael attracted the attention of the others and pointing to lord and lady greystoke cried  these here are my friends and they are to be left alone
d'ye understand
i'm captain of this ship now an' what i says goes he added turning to clayton
just keep to yourselves and nobody'll harm ye and he looked threateningly on his fellows
the claytons heeded black michael's instructions so well that they saw but little of the crew and knew nothing of the plans the men were making
occasionally they heard faint echoes of brawls and quarreling among the mutineers and on two occasions the vicious bark of firearms rang out on the still air
but black michael was a fit leader for this band of cutthroats and withal held them in fair subjection to his rule
on the fifth day following the murder of the ship's officers land was sighted by the lookout
whether island or mainland black michael did not know but he announced to clayton that if investigation showed that the place was habitable he and lady greystoke were to be put ashore with their belongings
you'll be all right there for a few months he explained and by that time we'll have been able to make an inhabited coast somewhere and scatter a bit
then i'll see that yer gover'ment's notified where you be an' they'll soon send a mano'war to fetch ye off
it would be a hard matter to land you in civilization without a lot o' questions being asked an' none o' us here has any very convincin' answers up our sleeves
clayton remonstrated against the inhumanity of landing them upon an unknown shore to be left to the mercies of savage beasts and possibly still more savage men
but his words were of no avail and only tended to anger black michael so he was forced to desist and make the best he could of a bad situation
about three o'clock in the afternoon they came about off a beautiful wooded shore opposite the mouth of what appeared to be a landlocked harbor
black michael sent a small boat filled with men to sound the entrance in an effort to determine if the fuwalda could be safely worked through the entrance
in about an hour they returned and reported deep water through the passage as well as far into the little basin
before dark the barkentine lay peacefully at anchor upon the bosom of the still mirrorlike surface of the harbor
the surrounding shores were beautiful with semitropical verdure while in the distance the country rose from the ocean in hill and tableland almost uniformly clothed by primeval forest
no signs of habitation were visible but that the land might easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird and animal life of which the watchers on the fuwalda's deck caught occasional glimpses as well as by the shimmer of a little river which emptied into the harbor insuring fresh water in plenitude
as darkness settled upon the earth clayton and lady alice still stood by the ship's rail in silent contemplation of their future abode
from the dark shadows of the mighty forest came the wild calls of savage beaststhe deep roar of the lion and occasionally the shrill scream of a panther
the woman shrank closer to the man in terrorstricken anticipation of the horrors lying in wait for them in the awful blackness of the nights to come when they should be alone upon that wild and lonely shore
later in the evening black michael joined them long enough to instruct them to make their preparations for landing on the morrow
they tried to persuade him to take them to some more hospitable coast near enough to civilization so that they might hope to fall into friendly hands
but no pleas or threats or promises of reward could move him
i am the only man aboard who would not rather see ye both safely dead and while i know that's the sensible way to make sure of our own necks yet black michael's not the man to forget a favor
ye saved my life once and in return i'm goin' to spare yours but that's all i can do
the men won't stand for any more and if we don't get ye landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about giving ye that much show
i'll put all yer stuff ashore with ye as well as cookin' utensils an' some old sails for tents an' enough grub to last ye until ye can find fruit and game
with yer guns for protection ye ought to be able to live here easy enough until help comes
when i get safely hid away i'll see to it that the british gover'ment learns about where ye be for the life of me i couldn't tell 'em exactly where for i don't know myself
but they'll find ye all right
after he had left them they went silently below each wrapped in gloomy forebodings
clayton did not believe that black michael had the slightest intention of notifying the british government of their whereabouts nor was he any too sure but that some treachery was contemplated for the following day when they should be on shore with the sailors who would have to accompany them with their belongings
once out of black michael's sight any of the men might strike them down and still leave black michael's conscience clear
and even should they escape that fate was it not but to be faced with far graver dangers
alone he might hope to survive for years for he was a strong athletic man
but what of alice and that other little life so soon to be launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval world
the man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity the fearful helplessness of their situation
but it was a merciful providence which prevented him from foreseeing the hideous reality which awaited them in the grim depths of that gloomy wood
early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for transportation to shore
there was a great quantity and variety of stuff as the claytons had expected a possible five to eight years' residence in their new home
thus in addition to the many necessities they had brought there were also many luxuries
black michael was determined that nothing belonging to the claytons should be left on board
whether out of compassion for them or in furtherance of his own selfinterests it would be difficult to say
there was no question but that the presence of property of a missing british official upon a suspicious vessel would have been a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world
so zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions that he insisted upon the return of clayton's revolvers to him by the sailors in whose possession they were
into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit with a small supply of potatoes and beans matches and cooking vessels a chest of tools and the old sails which black michael had promised them
as though himself fearing the very thing which clayton had suspected black michael accompanied them to shore and was the last to leave them when the small boats having filled the ship's casks with fresh water were pushed out toward the waiting fuwalda
as the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the bay clayton and his wife stood silently watching their departurein the breasts of both a feeling of impending disaster and utter hopelessness
and behind them over the edge of a low ridge other eyes watchedclose set wicked eyes gleaming beneath shaggy brows
as the fuwalda passed through the narrow entrance to the harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point lady alice threw her arms about clayton's neck and burst into uncontrolled sobs
bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny with heroic fortitude she had looked into the terrible future but now that the horror of absolute solitude was upon them her overwrought nerves gave way and the reaction came
he did not attempt to check her tears
it were better that nature have her way in relieving these longpent emotions and it was many minutes before the girllittle more than a child she wascould again gain mastery of herself
oh john she cried at last the horror of it
what are we to do
what are we to do
there is but one thing to do alice and he spoke as quietly as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home and that is work
work must be our salvation
we must not give ourselves time to think for in that direction lies madness
we must work and wait
i am sure that relief will come and come quickly when once it is apparent that the fuwalda has been lost even though black michael does not keep his word to us
but john if it were only you and i she sobbed we could endure it i know but  yes dear he answered gently i have been thinking of that also but we must face it as we must face whatever comes bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability to cope with circumstances whatever they may be
hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the dim and distant past faced the same problems which we must face possibly in these same primeval forests
that we are here today evidences their victory
what they did may we not do
and even better for are we not armed with ages of superior knowledge and have we not the means of protection defense and sustenance which science has given us but of which they were totally ignorant
what they accomplished alice with instruments and weapons of stone and bone surely that may we accomplish also
ah john i wish that i might be a man with a man's philosophy but i am but a woman seeing with my heart rather than my head and all that i can see is too horrible too unthinkable to put into words
i only hope you are right john
i will do my best to be a brave primeval woman a fit mate for the primeval man
clayton's first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for the night something which might serve to protect them from prowling beasts of prey
he opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition that they might both be armed against possible attack while at work and then together they sought a location for their first night's sleeping place
a hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot fairly free of trees here they decided eventually to build a permanent house but for the time being they both thought it best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were
to this end clayton selected four trees which formed a rectangle about eight feet square and cutting long branches from other trees he constructed a framework around them about ten feet from the ground fastening the ends of the branches securely to the trees by means of rope a quantity of which black michael had furnished him from the hold of the fuwalda
across this framework clayton placed other smaller branches quite close together
this platform he paved with the huge fronds of elephant's ear which grew in profusion about them and over the fronds he laid a great sail folded into several thicknesses
seven feet higher he constructed a similar though lighter platform to serve as roof and from the sides of this he suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls
when completed he had a rather snug little nest to which he carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage
it was now late in the afternoon and the balance of the daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder by means of which lady alice could mount to her new home
all during the day the forest about them had been filled with excited birds of brilliant plumage and dancing chattering monkeys who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful nest building operations with every mark of keenest interest and fascination
notwithstanding that both clayton and his wife kept a sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals though on two occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors come screaming and chattering from the nearby ridge casting frightened glances back over their little shoulders and evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing some terrible thing which lay concealed there
just before dusk clayton finished his ladder and filling a great basin with water from the nearby stream the two mounted to the comparative safety of their aerial chamber
as it was quite warm clayton had left the side curtains thrown back over the roof and as they sat like turks upon their blankets lady alice straining her eyes into the darkening shadows of the wood suddenly reached out and grasped clayton's arms
john she whispered look
what is it a man
as clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond a great figure standing upright upon the ridge
for a moment it stood as though listening and then turned slowly and melted into the shadows of the jungle
what is it john
i do not know alice he answered gravely it is too dark to see so far and it may have been but a shadow cast by the rising moon
no john if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque mockery of man
oh i am afraid
he gathered her in his arms whispering words of courage and love into her ears
soon after he lowered the curtain walls tying them securely to the trees so that except for a little opening toward the beach they were entirely enclosed
as it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay down upon their blankets to try to gain through sleep a brief respite of forgetfulness
clayton lay facing the opening at the front a rifle and a brace of revolvers at his hand
scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry of a panther rang out from the jungle behind them
closer and closer it came until they could hear the great beast directly beneath them
for an hour or more they heard it sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform but at last it roamed away across the beach where clayton could see it clearly in the brilliant moonlighta great handsome beast the largest he had ever seen
during the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful snatches of sleep for the night noises of a great jungle teeming with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves on edge so that a hundred times they were startled to wakefulness by piercing screams or the stealthy moving of great bodies beneath them
chapter iii  life and death   morning found them but little if at all refreshed though it was with a feeling of intense relief that they saw the day dawn
as soon as they had made their meager breakfast of salt pork coffee and biscuit clayton commenced work upon their house for he realized that they could hope for no safety and no peace of mind at night until four strong walls effectually barred the jungle life from them
the task was an arduous one and required the better part of a month though he built but one small room
he constructed his cabin of small logs about six inches in diameter stopping the chinks with clay which he found at the depth of a few feet beneath the surface soil
at one end he built a fireplace of small stones from the beach
these also he set in clay and when the house had been entirely completed he applied a coating of the clay to the entire outside surface to the thickness of four inches
in the window opening he set small branches about an inch in diameter both vertically and horizontally and so woven that they formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength of a powerful animal
thus they obtained air and proper ventilation without fear of lessening the safety of their cabin
the ashaped roof was thatched with small branches laid close together and over these long jungle grass and palm fronds with a final coating of clay
the door he built of pieces of the packingboxes which had held their belongings nailing one piece upon another the grain of contiguous layers running transversely until he had a solid body some three inches thick and of such great strength that they were both moved to laughter as they gazed upon it
here the greatest difficulty confronted clayton for he had no means whereby to hang his massive door now that he had built it
after two days' work however he succeeded in fashioning two massive hardwood hinges and with these he hung the door so that it opened and closed easily
the stuccoing and other final touches were added after they moved into the house which they had done as soon as the roof was on piling their boxes before the door at night and thus having a comparatively safe and comfortable habitation
the building of a bed chairs table and shelves was a relatively easy matter so that by the end of the second month they were well settled and but for the constant dread of attack by wild beasts and the ever growing loneliness they were not uncomfortable or unhappy
at night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny cabin but so accustomed may one become to oft repeated noises that soon they paid little attention to them sleeping soundly the whole night through
thrice had they caught fleeting glimpses of great manlike figures like that of the first night but never at sufficiently close range to know positively whether the halfseen forms were those of man or brute
the brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances and as they had evidently never seen human beings before they presently after their first fright had worn off approached closer and closer impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of the claytons
one afternoon while clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin for he contemplated building several more rooms a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge
ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them and finally they stopped near clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger
at last he saw it the thing the little monkeys so fearedthe manbrute of which the claytons had caught occasional fleeting glimpses
it was approaching through the jungle in a semierect position now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the grounda great anthropoid ape and as it advanced it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound
clayton was at some distance from the cabin having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations
grown careless from months of continued safety during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine
he knew that armed only with an ax his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeedand alice o god he thought what will become of alice
there was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin
he turned and ran toward it shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat
lady greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness for so large and awkward an animal in an effort to head off clayton
with a low cry she sprang toward the cabin and as she entered gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror for the brute had intercepted her husband who now stood at bay grasping his ax with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge
close and bolt the door alice cried clayton
i can finish this fellow with my ax
but he knew he was facing a horrible death and so did she
the ape was a great bull weighing probably three hundred pounds
his nasty closeset eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey
over the brute's shoulder clayton could see the doorway of his cabin not twenty paces distant and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge armed with one of his rifles
she had always been afraid of firearms and would never touch them but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young
back alice shouted clayton for god's sake go back
but she would not heed and just then the ape charged so that clayton could say no more
the man swung his ax with all his mighty strength but the powerful brute seized it in those terrible hands and tearing it from clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side
with an ugly snarl he closed upon his defenseless victim but ere his fangs had reached the throat they thirsted for there was a sharp report and a bullet entered the ape's back between his shoulders
throwing clayton to the ground the beast turned upon his new enemy
there before him stood the terrified girl vainly trying to fire another bullet into the animal's body but she did not understand the mechanism of the firearm and the hammer fell futilely upon an empty cartridge
almost simultaneously clayton regained his feet and without thought of the utter hopelessness of it he rushed forward to drag the ape from his wife's prostrate form
with little or no effort he succeeded and the great bulk rolled inertly upon the turf before himthe ape was dead
the bullet had done its work
a hasty examination of his wife revealed no marks upon her and clayton decided that the huge brute had died the instant he had sprung toward alice
gently he lifted his wife's still unconscious form and bore her to the little cabin but it was fully two hours before she regained consciousness
her first words filled clayton with vague apprehension
for some time after regaining her senses alice gazed wonderingly about the interior of the little cabin and then with a satisfied sigh said  o john it is so good to be really home
i have had an awful dream dear
i thought we were no longer in london but in some horrible place where great beasts attacked us
there there alice he said stroking her forehead try to sleep again and do not worry your head about bad dreams
that night a little son was born in the tiny cabin beside the primeval forest while a leopard screamed before the door and the deep notes of a lion's roar sounded from beyond the ridge
lady greystoke never recovered from the shock of the great ape's attack and though she lived for a year after her baby was born she was never again outside the cabin nor did she ever fully realize that she was not in england
sometimes she would question clayton as to the strange noises of the nights the absence of servants and friends and the strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room but though he made no effort to deceive her never could she grasp the meaning of it all
in other ways she was quite rational and the joy and happiness she took in the possession of her little son and the constant attentions of her husband made that year a very happy one for her the happiest of her young life
that it would have been beset by worries and apprehension had she been in full command of her mental faculties clayton well knew so that while he suffered terribly to see her so there were times when he was almost glad for her sake that she could not understand
long since had he given up any hope of rescue except through accident
with unremitting zeal he had worked to beautify the interior of the cabin
skins of lion and panther covered the floor
cupboards and bookcases lined the walls
odd vases made by his own hand from the clay of the region held beautiful tropical flowers
curtains of grass and bamboo covered the windows and most arduous task of all with his meager assortment of tools he had fashioned lumber to neatly seal the walls and ceiling and lay a smooth floor within the cabin
that he had been able to turn his hands at all to such unaccustomed labor was a source of mild wonder to him
but he loved the work because it was for her and the tiny life that had come to cheer them though adding a hundredfold to his responsibilities and to the terribleness of their situation
during the year that followed clayton was several times attacked by the great apes which now seemed to continually infest the vicinity of the cabin but as he never again ventured outside without both rifle and revolvers he had little fear of the huge beasts
he had strengthened the window protections and fitted a unique wooden lock to the cabin door so that when he hunted for game and fruits as it was constantly necessary for him to do to insure sustenance he had no fear that any animal could break into the little home
at first he shot much of the game from the cabin windows but toward the end the animals learned to fear the strange lair from whence issued the terrifying thunder of his rifle
in his leisure clayton read often aloud to his wife from the store of books he had brought for their new home
among these were many for little childrenpicture books primers readersfor they had known that their little child would be old enough for such before they might hope to return to england
at other times clayton wrote in his diary which he had always been accustomed to keep in french and in which he recorded the details of their strange life
this book he kept locked in a little metal box
a year from the day her little son was born lady alice passed quietly away in the night
so peaceful was her end that it was hours before clayton could awake to a realization that his wife was dead
the horror of the situation came to him very slowly and it is doubtful that he ever fully realized the enormity of his sorrow and the fearful responsibility that had devolved upon him with the care of that wee thing his son still a nursing babe
the last entry in his diary was made the morning following her death and there he recites the sad details in a matteroffact way that adds to the pathos of it for it breathes a tired apathy born of long sorrow and hopelessness which even this cruel blow could scarcely awake to further suffering   my little son is crying for nourishmento alice alice what shall i do
and as john clayton wrote the last words his hand was destined ever to pen he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who lay still and cold in the bed beside him
for a long time no sound broke the deathlike stillness of the jungle midday save the piteous wailing of the tiny manchild
chapter iv  the apes   in the forest of the tableland a mile back from the ocean old kerchak the ape was on a rampage of rage among his people
the younger and lighter members of his tribe scampered to the higher branches of the great trees to escape his wrath risking their lives upon branches that scarce supported their weight rather than face old kerchak in one of his fits of uncontrolled anger
the other males scattered in all directions but not before the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between his great foaming jaws
a luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at kerchak's feet
with a wild scream he was upon her tearing a great piece from her side with his mighty teeth and striking her viciously upon her head and shoulders with a broken tree limb until her skull was crushed to a jelly
and then he spied kala who returning from a search for food with her young babe was ignorant of the state of the mighty male's temper until suddenly the shrill warnings of her fellows caused her to scamper madly for safety
but kerchak was close upon her so close that he had almost grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into space from one tree to anothera perilous chance which apes seldom if ever take unless so closely pursued by danger that there is no alternative
she made the leap successfully but as she grasped the limb of the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the tiny babe where it clung frantically to her neck and she saw the little thing hurled turning and twisting to the ground thirty feet below
with a low cry of dismay kala rushed headlong to its side thoughtless now of the danger from kerchak but when she gathered the wee mangled form to her bosom life had left it
with low moans she sat cuddling the body to her nor did kerchak attempt to molest her
with the death of the babe his fit of demoniacal rage passed as suddenly as it had seized him
kerchak was a huge king ape weighing perhaps three hundred and fifty pounds
his forehead was extremely low and receding his eyes bloodshot small and close set to his coarse flat nose his ears large and thin but smaller than most of his kind
his awful temper and his mighty strength made him supreme among the little tribe into which he had been born some twenty years before
now that he was in his prime there was no simian in all the mighty forest through which he roved that dared contest his right to rule nor did the other and larger animals molest him
old tantor the elephant alone of all the wild savage life feared him notand he alone did kerchak fear
when tantor trumpeted the great ape scurried with his fellows high among the trees of the second terrace
the tribe of anthropoids over which kerchak ruled with an iron hand and bared fangs numbered some six or eight families each family consisting of an adult male with his females and their young numbering in all some sixty or seventy apes
kala was the youngest mate of a male called tublat meaning broken nose and the child she had seen dashed to death was her first for she was but nine or ten years old
notwithstanding her youth she was large and powerfula splendid cleanlimbed animal with a round high forehead which denoted more intelligence than most of her kind possessed
so also she had a great capacity for mother love and mother sorrow
but she was still an ape a huge fierce terrible beast of a species closely allied to the gorilla yet more intelligent which with the strength of their cousin made her kind the most fearsome of those aweinspiring progenitors of man
when the tribe saw that kerchak's rage had ceased they came slowly down from their arboreal retreats and pursued again the various occupations which he had interrupted
the young played and frolicked about among the trees and bushes
some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of dead and decaying vegetation which covered the ground while others turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods of earth in search of the small bugs and reptiles which formed a part of their food
others again searched the surrounding trees for fruit nuts small birds and eggs
they had passed an hour or so thus when kerchak called them together and with a word of command to them to follow him set off toward the sea
they traveled for the most part upon the ground where it was open following the path of the great elephants whose comings and goings break the only roads through those tangled mazes of bush vine creeper and tree
when they walked it was with a rolling awkward motion placing the knuckles of their closed hands upon the ground and swinging their ungainly bodies forward
but when the way was through the lower trees they moved more swiftly swinging from branch to branch with the agility of their smaller cousins the monkeys
and all the way kala carried her little dead baby hugged closely to her breast
it was shortly after noon when they reached a ridge overlooking the beach where below them lay the tiny cottage which was kerchak's goal
he had seen many of his kind go to their deaths before the loud noise made by the little black stick in the hands of the strange white ape who lived in that wonderful lair and kerchak had made up his brute mind to own that deathdealing contrivance and to explore the interior of the mysterious den
he wanted very very much to feel his teeth sink into the neck of the queer animal that he had learned to hate and fear and because of this he came often with his tribe to reconnoiter waiting for a time when the white ape should be off his guard
of late they had quit attacking or even showing themselves for every time they had done so in the past the little stick had roared out its terrible message of death to some member of the tribe
today there was no sign of the man about and from where they watched they could see that the cabin door was open
slowly cautiously and noiselessly they crept through the jungle toward the little cabin
there were no growls no fierce screams of ragethe little black stick had taught them to come quietly lest they awaken it
on on they came until kerchak himself slunk stealthily to the very door and peered within
behind him were two males and then kala closely straining the little dead form to her breast
inside the den they saw the strange white ape lying half across a table his head buried in his arms and on the bed lay a figure covered by a sailcloth while from a tiny rustic cradle came the plaintive wailing of a babe
noiselessly kerchak entered crouching for the charge and then john clayton rose with a sudden start and faced them
the sight that met his eyes must have frozen him with horror for there within the door stood three great bull apes while behind them crowded many more how many he never knew for his revolvers were hanging on the far wall beside his rifle and kerchak was charging
when the king ape released the limp form which had been john clayton lord greystoke he turned his attention toward the little cradle but kala was there before him and when he would have grasped the child she snatched it herself and before he could intercept her she had bolted through the door and taken refuge in a high tree
as she took up the little live baby of alice clayton she dropped the dead body of her own into the empty cradle for the wail of the living had answered the call of universal motherhood within her wild breast which the dead could not still
high up among the branches of a mighty tree she hugged the shrieking infant to her bosom and soon the instinct that was as dominant in this fierce female as it had been in the breast of his tender and beautiful motherthe instinct of mother lovereached out to the tiny manchild's halfformed understanding and he became quiet
then hunger closed the gap between them and the son of an english lord and an english lady nursed at the breast of kala the great ape
in the meantime the beasts within the cabin were warily examining the contents of this strange lair
once satisfied that clayton was dead kerchak turned his attention to the thing which lay upon the bed covered by a piece of sailcloth
gingerly he lifted one corner of the shroud but when he saw the body of the woman beneath he tore the cloth roughly from her form and seized the still white throat in his huge hairy hands
a moment he let his fingers sink deep into the cold flesh and then realizing that she was already dead he turned from her to examine the contents of the room nor did he again molest the body of either lady alice or sir john
the rifle hanging upon the wall caught his first attention it was for this strange deathdealing thunderstick that he had yearned for months but now that it was within his grasp he scarcely had the temerity to seize it
cautiously he approached the thing ready to flee precipitately should it speak in its deep roaring tones as he had heard it speak before the last words to those of his kind who through ignorance or rashness had attacked the wonderful white ape that had borne it
deep in the beast's intelligence was something which assured him that the thunderstick was only dangerous when in the hands of one who could manipulate it but yet it was several minutes ere he could bring himself to touch it
instead he walked back and forth along the floor before it turning his head so that never once did his eyes leave the object of his desire
using his long arms as a man uses crutches and rolling his huge carcass from side to side with each stride the great king ape paced to and fro uttering deep growls occasionally punctuated with the earpiercing scream than which there is no more terrifying noise in all the jungle
presently he halted before the rifle
slowly he raised a huge hand until it almost touched the shining barrel only to withdraw it once more and continue his hurried pacing
it was as though the great brute by this show of fearlessness and through the medium of his wild voice was endeavoring to bolster up his courage to the point which would permit him to take the rifle in his hand
again he stopped and this time succeeded in forcing his reluctant hand to the cold steel only to snatch it away almost immediately and resume his restless beat
time after time this strange ceremony was repeated but on each occasion with increased confidence until finally the rifle was torn from its hook and lay in the grasp of the great brute
finding that it harmed him not kerchak began to examine it closely
he felt of it from end to end peered down the black depths of the muzzle fingered the sights the breech the stock and finally the trigger
during all these operations the apes who had entered sat huddled near the door watching their chief while those outside strained and crowded to catch a glimpse of what transpired within
suddenly kerchak's finger closed upon the trigger
there was a deafening roar in the little room and the apes at and beyond the door fell over one another in their wild anxiety to escape
kerchak was equally frightened so frightened in fact that he quite forgot to throw aside the author of that fearful noise but bolted for the door with it tightly clutched in one hand
as he passed through the opening the front sight of the rifle caught upon the edge of the inswung door with sufficient force to close it tightly after the fleeing ape
when kerchak came to a halt a short distance from the cabin and discovered that he still held the rifle he dropped it as he might have dropped a red hot iron nor did he again attempt to recover itthe noise was too much for his brute nerves but he was now quite convinced that the terrible stick was quite harmless by itself if left alone
it was an hour before the apes could again bring themselves to approach the cabin to continue their investigations and when they finally did so they found to their chagrin that the door was closed and so securely fastened that they could not force it
the cleverly constructed latch which clayton had made for the door had sprung as kerchak passed out nor could the apes find means of ingress through the heavily barred windows
after roaming about the vicinity for a short time they started back for the deeper forests and the higher land from whence they had come
kala had not once come to earth with her little adopted babe but now kerchak called to her to descend with the rest and as there was no note of anger in his voice she dropped lightly from branch to branch and joined the others on their homeward march
those of the apes who attempted to examine kala's strange baby were repulsed with bared fangs and low menacing growls accompanied by words of warning from kala
when they assured her that they meant the child no harm she permitted them to come close but would not allow them to touch her charge
it was as though she knew that her baby was frail and delicate and feared lest the rough hands of her fellows might injure the little thing
another thing she did and which made traveling an onerous trial for her
remembering the death of her own little one she clung desperately to the new babe with one hand whenever they were upon the march
the other young rode upon their mothers' backs their little arms tightly clasping the hairy necks before them while their legs were locked beneath their mothers' armpits
not so with kala she held the small form of the little lord greystoke tightly to her breast where the dainty hands clutched the long black hair which covered that portion of her body
she had seen one child fall from her back to a terrible death and she would take no further chances with this
chapter v  the white ape   tenderly kala nursed her little waif wondering silently why it did not gain strength and agility as did the little apes of other mothers
it was nearly a year from the time the little fellow came into her possession before he would walk alone and as for climbingmy but how stupid he was
kala sometimes talked with the older females about her young hopeful but none of them could understand how a child could be so slow and backward in learning to care for itself
why it could not even find food alone and more than twelve moons had passed since kala had come upon it
had they known that the child had seen thirteen moons before it had come into kala's possession they would have considered its case as absolutely hopeless for the little apes of their own tribe were as far advanced in two or three moons as was this little stranger after twentyfive
tublat kala's husband was sorely vexed and but for the female's careful watching would have put the child out of the way
he will never be a great ape he argued
always will you have to carry him and protect him
what good will he be to the tribe
none only a burden
let us leave him quietly sleeping among the tall grasses that you may bear other and stronger apes to guard us in our old age
never broken nose replied kala
if i must carry him forever so be it
and then tublat went to kerchak to urge him to use his authority with kala and force her to give up little tarzan which was the name they had given to the tiny lord greystoke and which meant whiteskin
but when kerchak spoke to her about it kala threatened to run away from the tribe if they did not leave her in peace with the child and as this is one of the inalienable rights of the jungle folk if they be dissatisfied among their own people they bothered her no more for kala was a fine cleanlimbed young female and they did not wish to lose her
as tarzan grew he made more rapid strides so that by the time he was ten years old he was an excellent climber and on the ground could do many wonderful things which were beyond the powers of his little brothers and sisters
in many ways did he differ from them and they often marveled at his superior cunning but in strength and size he was deficient for at ten the great anthropoids were fully grown some of them towering over six feet in height while little tarzan was still but a halfgrown boy
yet such a boy
from early childhood he had used his hands to swing from branch to branch after the manner of his giant mother and as he grew older he spent hour upon hour daily speeding through the tree tops with his brothers and sisters
he could spring twenty feet across space at the dizzy heights of the forest top and grasp with unerring precision and without apparent jar a limb waving wildly in the path of an approaching tornado
he could drop twenty feet at a stretch from limb to limb in rapid descent to the ground or he could gain the utmost pinnacle of the loftiest tropical giant with the ease and swiftness of a squirrel
though but ten years old he was fully as strong as the average man of thirty and far more agile than the most practiced athlete ever becomes
and day by day his strength was increasing
his life among these fierce apes had been happy for his recollection held no other life nor did he know that there existed within the universe aught else than his little forest and the wild jungle animals with which he was familiar
he was nearly ten before he commenced to realize that a great difference existed between himself and his fellows
his little body burned brown by exposure suddenly caused him feelings of intense shame for he realized that it was entirely hairless like some low snake or other reptile
he attempted to obviate this by plastering himself from head to foot with mud but this dried and fell off
besides it felt so uncomfortable that he quickly decided that he preferred the shame to the discomfort
in the higher land which his tribe frequented was a little lake and it was here that tarzan first saw his face in the clear still waters of its bosom
it was on a sultry day of the dry season that he and one of his cousins had gone down to the bank to drink
as they leaned over both little faces were mirrored on the placid pool the fierce and terrible features of the ape beside those of the aristocratic scion of an old english house
tarzan was appalled
it had been bad enough to be hairless but to own such a countenance
he wondered that the other apes could look at him at all
that tiny slit of a mouth and those puny white teeth
how they looked beside the mighty lips and powerful fangs of his more fortunate brothers
and the little pinched nose of his so thin was it that it looked half starved
he turned red as he compared it with the beautiful broad nostrils of his companion
such a generous nose
why it spread half across his face
it certainly must be fine to be so handsome thought poor little tarzan
but when he saw his own eyes ah that was the final blowa brown spot a gray circle and then blank whiteness
frightful
not even the snakes had such hideous eyes as he
so intent was he upon this personal appraisement of his features that he did not hear the parting of the tall grass behind him as a great body pushed itself stealthily through the jungle nor did his companion the ape hear either for he was drinking and the noise of his sucking lips and gurgles of satisfaction drowned the quiet approach of the intruder
not thirty paces behind the two she crouchedsabor the huge lionesslashing her tail
cautiously she moved a great padded paw forward noiselessly placing it before she lifted the next
thus she advanced her belly low almost touching the surface of the grounda great cat preparing to spring upon its prey
now she was within ten feet of the two unsuspecting little playfellowscarefully she drew her hind feet well up beneath her body the great muscles rolling under the beautiful skin
so low she was crouching now that she seemed flattened to the earth except for the upward bend of the glossy back as it gathered for the spring
no longer the tail lashedquiet and straight behind her it lay
an instant she paused thus as though turned to stone and then with an awful scream she sprang
sabor the lioness was a wise hunter
to one less wise the wild alarm of her fierce cry as she sprang would have seemed a foolish thing for could she not more surely have fallen upon her victims had she but quietly leaped without that loud shriek
but sabor knew well the wondrous quickness of the jungle folk and their almost unbelievable powers of hearing
to them the sudden scraping of one blade of grass across another was as effectual a warning as her loudest cry and sabor knew that she could not make that mighty leap without a little noise
her wild scream was not a warning
it was voiced to freeze her poor victims in a paralysis of terror for the tiny fraction of an instant which would suffice for her mighty claws to sink into their soft flesh and hold them beyond hope of escape
so far as the ape was concerned sabor reasoned correctly
the little fellow crouched trembling just an instant but that instant was quite long enough to prove his undoing
not so however with tarzan the manchild
his life amidst the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet emergencies with selfconfidence and his higher intelligence resulted in a quickness of mental action far beyond the powers of the apes
so the scream of sabor the lioness galvanized the brain and muscles of little tarzan into instant action
before him lay the deep waters of the little lake behind him certain death a cruel death beneath tearing claws and rending fangs
tarzan had always hated water except as a medium for quenching his thirst
he hated it because he connected it with the chill and discomfort of the torrential rains and he feared it for the thunder and lightning and wind which accompanied them
the deep waters of the lake he had been taught by his wild mother to avoid and further had he not seen little neeta sink beneath its quiet surface only a few short weeks before never to return to the tribe
but of the two evils his quick mind chose the lesser ere the first note of sabor's scream had scarce broken the quiet of the jungle and before the great beast had covered half her leap tarzan felt the chill waters close above his head
he could not swim and the water was very deep but still he lost no particle of that selfconfidence and resourcefulness which were the badges of his superior being
rapidly he moved his hands and feet in an attempt to scramble upward and possibly more by chance than design he fell into the stroke that a dog uses when swimming so that within a few seconds his nose was above water and he found that he could keep it there by continuing his strokes and also make progress through the water
he was much surprised and pleased with this new acquirement which had been so suddenly thrust upon him but he had no time for thinking much upon it
he was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he saw the cruel beast that would have seized him crouching upon the still form of his little playmate
the lioness was intently watching tarzan evidently expecting him to return to shore but this the boy had no intention of doing
instead he raised his voice in the call of distress common to his tribe adding to it the warning which would prevent wouldbe rescuers from running into the clutches of sabor
almost immediately there came an answer from the distance and presently forty or fifty great apes swung rapidly and majestically through the trees toward the scene of tragedy
in the lead was kala for she had recognized the tones of her best beloved and with her was the mother of the little ape who lay dead beneath cruel sabor
though more powerful and better equipped for fighting than the apes the lioness had no desire to meet these enraged adults and with a snarl of hatred she sprang quickly into the brush and disappeared
tarzan now swam to shore and clambered quickly upon dry land
the feeling of freshness and exhilaration which the cool waters had imparted to him filled his little being with grateful surprise and ever after he lost no opportunity to take a daily plunge in lake or stream or ocean when it was possible to do so
for a long time kala could not accustom herself to the sight for though her people could swim when forced to it they did not like to enter water and never did so voluntarily
the adventure with the lioness gave tarzan food for pleasurable memories for it was such affairs which broke the monotony of his daily lifeotherwise but a dull round of searching for food eating and sleeping
the tribe to which he belonged roamed a tract extending roughly twentyfive miles along the seacoast and some fifty miles inland
this they traversed almost continually occasionally remaining for months in one locality but as they moved through the trees with great speed they often covered the territory in a very few days
much depended upon food supply climatic conditions and the prevalence of animals of the more dangerous species though kerchak often led them on long marches for no other reason than that he had tired of remaining in the same place
at night they slept where darkness overtook them lying upon the ground and sometimes covering their heads and more seldom their bodies with the great leaves of the elephant's ear
two or three might lie cuddled in each other's arms for additional warmth if the night were chill and thus tarzan had slept in kala's arms nightly for all these years
that the huge fierce brute loved this child of another race is beyond question and he too gave to the great hairy beast all the affection that would have belonged to his fair young mother had she lived
when he was disobedient she cuffed him it is true but she was never cruel to him and was more often caressing him than chastising him
tublat her mate always hated tarzan and on several occasions had come near ending his youthful career
tarzan on his part never lost an opportunity to show that he fully reciprocated his foster father's sentiments and whenever he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl insults upon him from the safety of his mother's arms or the slender branches of the higher trees he did so
his superior intelligence and cunning permitted him to invent a thousand diabolical tricks to add to the burdens of tublat's life
early in his boyhood he had learned to form ropes by twisting and tying long grasses together and with these he was forever tripping tublat or attempting to hang him from some overhanging branch
by constant playing and experimenting with these he learned to tie rude knots and make sliding nooses and with these he and the younger apes amused themselves
what tarzan did they tried to do also but he alone originated and became proficient
one day while playing thus tarzan had thrown his rope at one of his fleeing companions retaining the other end in his grasp
by accident the noose fell squarely about the running ape's neck bringing him to a sudden and surprising halt
ah here was a new game a fine game thought tarzan and immediately he attempted to repeat the trick
and thus by painstaking and continued practice he learned the art of roping
now indeed was the life of tublat a living nightmare
in sleep upon the march night or day he never knew when that quiet noose would slip about his neck and nearly choke the life out of him
kala punished tublat swore dire vengeance and old kerchak took notice and warned and threatened but all to no avail
tarzan defied them all and the thin strong noose continued to settle about tublat's neck whenever he least expected it
the other apes derived unlimited amusement from tublat's discomfiture for broken nose was a disagreeable old fellow whom no one liked anyway
in tarzan's clever little mind many thoughts revolved and back of these was his divine power of reason
if he could catch his fellow apes with his long arm of many grasses why not sabor the lioness
it was the germ of a thought which however was destined to mull around in his conscious and subconscious mind until it resulted in magnificent achievement
but that came in later years
chapter vi  jungle battles   the wanderings of the tribe brought them often near the closed and silent cabin by the little landlocked harbor
to tarzan this was always a source of neverending mystery and pleasure
he would peek into the curtained windows or climbing upon the roof peer down the black depths of the chimney in vain endeavor to solve the unknown wonders that lay within those strong walls
his childlike imagination pictured wonderful creatures within and the very impossibility of forcing entrance added a thousandfold to his desire to do so
he could clamber about the roof and windows for hours attempting to discover means of ingress but to the door he paid little attention for this was apparently as solid as the walls
it was in the next visit to the vicinity following the adventure with old sabor that as he approached the cabin tarzan noticed that from a distance the door appeared to be an independent part of the wall in which it was set and for the first time it occurred to him that this might prove the means of entrance which had so long eluded him
he was alone as was often the case when he visited the cabin for the apes had no love for it the story of the thunderstick having lost nothing in the telling during these ten years had quite surrounded the white man's deserted abode with an atmosphere of weirdness and terror for the simians
the story of his own connection with the cabin had never been told him
the language of the apes had so few words that they could talk but little of what they had seen in the cabin having no words to accurately describe either the strange people or their belongings and so long before tarzan was old enough to understand the subject had been forgotten by the tribe
only in a dim vague way had kala explained to him that his father had been a strange white ape but he did not know that kala was not his own mother
on this day then he went directly to the door and spent hours examining it and fussing with the hinges the knob and the latch
finally he stumbled upon the right combination and the door swung creakingly open before his astonished eyes
for some minutes he did not dare venture within but finally as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the interior he slowly and cautiously entered
in the middle of the floor lay a skeleton every vestige of flesh gone from the bones to which still clung the mildewed and moldered remnants of what had once been clothing
upon the bed lay a similar gruesome thing but smaller while in a tiny cradle nearby was a third a wee mite of a skeleton
to none of these evidences of a fearful tragedy of a long dead day did little tarzan give but passing heed
his wild jungle life had inured him to the sight of dead and dying animals and had he known that he was looking upon the remains of his own father and mother he would have been no more greatly moved
the furnishings and other contents of the room it was which riveted his attention
he examined many things minutelystrange tools and weapons books paper clothingwhat little had withstood the ravages of time in the humid atmosphere of the jungle coast
he opened chests and cupboards such as did not baffle his small experience and in these he found the contents much better preserved
among other things he found a sharp hunting knife on the keen blade of which he immediately proceeded to cut his finger
undaunted he continued his experiments finding that he could hack and hew splinters of wood from the table and chairs with this new toy
for a long time this amused him but finally tiring he continued his explorations
in a cupboard filled with books he came across one with brightly colored picturesit was a child's illustrated alphabet                a is for archer               who shoots with a bow
b is for boy               his first name is joe
the pictures interested him greatly
there were many apes with faces similar to his own and further over in the book he found under m some little monkeys such as he saw daily flitting through the trees of his primeval forest
but nowhere was pictured any of his own people in all the book was none that resembled kerchak or tublat or kala
at first he tried to pick the little figures from the leaves but he soon saw that they were not real though he knew not what they might be nor had he any words to describe them
the boats and trains and cows and horses were quite meaningless to him but not quite so baffling as the odd little figures which appeared beneath and between the colored picturessome strange kind of bug he thought they might be for many of them had legs though nowhere could he find one with eyes and a mouth
it was his first introduction to the letters of the alphabet and he was over ten years old
of course he had never before seen print or ever had spoken with any living thing which had the remotest idea that such a thing as a written language existed nor ever had he seen anyone reading
so what wonder that the little boy was quite at a loss to guess the meaning of these strange figures
near the middle of the book he found his old enemy sabor the lioness and further on coiled histah the snake
oh it was most engrossing
never before in all his ten years had he enjoyed anything so much
so absorbed was he that he did not note the approaching dusk until it was quite upon him and the figures were blurred
he put the book back in the cupboard and closed the door for he did not wish anyone else to find and destroy his treasure and as he went out into the gathering darkness he closed the great door of the cabin behind him as it had been before he discovered the secret of its lock but before he left he had noticed the hunting knife lying where he had thrown it upon the floor and this he picked up and took with him to show to his fellows
he had taken scarce a dozen steps toward the jungle when a great form rose up before him from the shadows of a low bush
at first he thought it was one of his own people but in another instant he realized that it was bolgani the huge gorilla
so close was he that there was no chance for flight and little tarzan knew that he must stand and fight for his life for these great beasts were the deadly enemies of his tribe and neither one nor the other ever asked or gave quarter
had tarzan been a fullgrown bull ape of the species of his tribe he would have been more than a match for the gorilla but being only a little english boy though enormously muscular for such he stood no chance against his cruel antagonist
in his veins though flowed the blood of the best of a race of mighty fighters and back of this was the training of his short lifetime among the fierce brutes of the jungle
he knew no fear as we know it his little heart beat the faster but from the excitement and exhilaration of adventure
had the opportunity presented itself he would have escaped but solely because his judgment told him he was no match for the great thing which confronted him
and since reason showed him that successful flight was impossible he met the gorilla squarely and bravely without a tremor of a single muscle or any sign of panic
in fact he met the brute midway in its charge striking its huge body with his closed fists and as futilely as he had been a fly attacking an elephant
but in one hand he still clutched the knife he had found in the cabin of his father and as the brute striking and biting closed upon him the boy accidentally turned the point toward the hairy breast
as the knife sank deep into its body the gorilla shrieked in pain and rage
but the boy had learned in that brief second a use for his sharp and shining toy so that as the tearing striking beast dragged him to earth he plunged the blade repeatedly and to the hilt into its breast
the gorilla fighting after the manner of its kind struck terrific blows with its open hand and tore the flesh at the boy's throat and chest with its mighty tusks
for a moment they rolled upon the ground in the fierce frenzy of combat
more and more weakly the torn and bleeding arm struck home with the long sharp blade then the little figure stiffened with a spasmodic jerk and tarzan the young lord greystoke rolled unconscious upon the dead and decaying vegetation which carpeted his jungle home
a mile back in the forest the tribe had heard the fierce challenge of the gorilla and as was his custom when any danger threatened kerchak called his people together partly for mutual protection against a common enemy since this gorilla might be but one of a party of several and also to see that all members of the tribe were accounted for
it was soon discovered that tarzan was missing and tublat was strongly opposed to sending assistance
kerchak himself had no liking for the strange little waif so he listened to tublat and finally with a shrug of his shoulders turned back to the pile of leaves on which he had made his bed
but kala was of a different mind in fact she had not waited but to learn that tarzan was absent ere she was fairly flying through the matted branches toward the point from which the cries of the gorilla were still plainly audible
darkness had now fallen and an early moon was sending its faint light to cast strange grotesque shadows among the dense foliage of the forest
here and there the brilliant rays penetrated to earth but for the most part they only served to accentuate the stygian blackness of the jungle's depths
like some huge phantom kala swung noiselessly from tree to tree now running nimbly along a great branch now swinging through space at the end of another only to grasp that of a farther tree in her rapid progress toward the scene of the tragedy her knowledge of jungle life told her was being enacted a short distance before her
the cries of the gorilla proclaimed that it was in mortal combat with some other denizen of the fierce wood
suddenly these cries ceased and the silence of death reigned throughout the jungle
kala could not understand for the voice of bolgani had at last been raised in the agony of suffering and death but no sound had come to her by which she possibly could determine the nature of his antagonist
that her little tarzan could destroy a great bull gorilla she knew to be improbable and so as she neared the spot from which the sounds of the struggle had come she moved more warily and at last slowly and with extreme caution she traversed the lowest branches peering eagerly into the moonsplashed blackness for a sign of the combatants
presently she came upon them lying in a little open space full under the brilliant light of the moonlittle tarzan's torn and bloody form and beside it a great bull gorilla stone dead
with a low cry kala rushed to tarzan's side and gathering the poor bloodcovered body to her breast listened for a sign of life
faintly she heard itthe weak beating of the little heart
tenderly she bore him back through the inky jungle to where the tribe lay and for many days and nights she sat guard beside him bringing him food and water and brushing the flies and other insects from his cruel wounds
of medicine or surgery the poor thing knew nothing
she could but lick the wounds and thus she kept them cleansed that healing nature might the more quickly do her work
at first tarzan would eat nothing but rolled and tossed in a wild delirium of fever
all he craved was water and this she brought him in the only way she could bearing it in her own mouth
no human mother could have shown more unselfish and sacrificing devotion than did this poor wild brute for the little orphaned waif whom fate had thrown into her keeping
at last the fever abated and the boy commenced to mend
no word of complaint passed his tight set lips though the pain of his wounds was excruciating
a portion of his chest was laid bare to the ribs three of which had been broken by the mighty blows of the gorilla
one arm was nearly severed by the giant fangs and a great piece had been torn from his neck exposing his jugular vein which the cruel jaws had missed but by a miracle
with the stoicism of the brutes who had raised him he endured his suffering quietly preferring to crawl away from the others and lie huddled in some clump of tall grasses rather than to show his misery before their eyes
kala alone he was glad to have with him but now that he was better she was gone longer at a time in search of food for the devoted animal had scarcely eaten enough to support her own life while tarzan had been so low and was in consequence reduced to a mere shadow of her former self
chapter vii  the light of knowledge   after what seemed an eternity to the little sufferer he was able to walk once more and from then on his recovery was so rapid that in another month he was as strong and active as ever
during his convalescence he had gone over in his mind many times the battle with the gorilla and his first thought was to recover the wonderful little weapon which had transformed him from a hopelessly outclassed weakling to the superior of the mighty terror of the jungle
also he was anxious to return to the cabin and continue his investigations of its wondrous contents
so early one morning he set forth alone upon his quest
after a little search he located the cleanpicked bones of his late adversary and close by partly buried beneath the fallen leaves he found the knife now red with rust from its exposure to the dampness of the ground and from the dried blood of the gorilla
he did not like the change in its former bright and gleaming surface but it was still a formidable weapon and one which he meant to use to advantage whenever the opportunity presented itself
he had in mind that no more would he run from the wanton attacks of old tublat
in another moment he was at the cabin and after a short time had again thrown the latch and entered
his first concern was to learn the mechanism of the lock and this he did by examining it closely while the door was open so that he could learn precisely what caused it to hold the door and by what means it released at his touch
he found that he could close and lock the door from within and this he did so that there would be no chance of his being molested while at his investigation
he commenced a systematic search of the cabin but his attention was soon riveted by the books which seemed to exert a strange and powerful influence over him so that he could scarce attend to aught else for the lure of the wondrous puzzle which their purpose presented to him
among the other books were a primer some child's readers numerous picture books and a great dictionary
all of these he examined but the pictures caught his fancy most though the strange little bugs which covered the pages where there were no pictures excited his wonder and deepest thought
squatting upon his haunches on the table top in the cabin his father had builthis smooth brown naked little body bent over the book which rested in his strong slender hands and his great shock of long black hair falling about his wellshaped head and bright intelligent eyestarzan of the apes little primitive man presented a picture filled at once with pathos and with promisean allegorical figure of the primordial groping through the black night of ignorance toward the light of learning
his little face was tense in study for he had partially grasped in a hazy nebulous way the rudiments of a thought which was destined to prove the key and the solution to the puzzling problem of the strange little bugs
in his hands was a primer opened at a picture of a little ape similar to himself but covered except for hands and face with strange colored fur for such he thought the jacket and trousers to be
beneath the picture were three little bugs                boy
and now he had discovered in the text upon the page that these three were repeated many times in the same sequence
another fact he learnedthat there were comparatively few individual bugs but these were repeated many times occasionally alone but more often in company with others
slowly he turned the pages scanning the pictures and the text for a repetition of the combination boy
presently he found it beneath a picture of another little ape and a strange animal which went upon four legs like the jackal and resembled him not a little
beneath this picture the bugs appeared as                a boy and a dog   there they were the three little bugs which always accompanied the little ape
and so he progressed very very slowly for it was a hard and laborious task which he had set himself without knowing ita task which might seem to you or me impossiblelearning to read without having the slightest knowledge of letters or written language or the faintest idea that such things existed
he did not accomplish it in a day or in a week or in a month or in a year but slowly very slowly he learned after he had grasped the possibilities which lay in those little bugs so that by the time he was fifteen he knew the various combinations of letters which stood for every pictured figure in the little primer and in one or two of the picture books
of the meaning and use of the articles and conjunctions verbs and adverbs and pronouns he had but the faintest conception
one day when he was about twelve he found a number of lead pencils in a hitherto undiscovered drawer beneath the table and in scratching upon the table top with one of them he was delighted to discover the black line it left behind it
he worked so assiduously with this new toy that the table top was soon a mass of scrawly loops and irregular lines and his pencilpoint worn down to the wood
then he took another pencil but this time he had a definite object in view
he would attempt to reproduce some of the little bugs that scrambled over the pages of his books
it was a difficult task for he held the pencil as one would grasp the hilt of a dagger which does not add greatly to ease in writing or to the legibility of the results
but he persevered for months at such times as he was able to come to the cabin until at last by repeated experimenting he found a position in which to hold the pencil that best permitted him to guide and control it so that at last he could roughly reproduce any of the little bugs
thus he made a beginning of writing
copying the bugs taught him another thingtheir number and though he could not count as we understand it yet he had an idea of quantity the base of his calculations being the number of fingers upon one of his hands
his search through the various books convinced him that he had discovered all the different kinds of bugs most often repeated in combination and these he arranged in proper order with great ease because of the frequency with which he had perused the fascinating alphabet picture book
his education progressed but his greatest finds were in the inexhaustible storehouse of the huge illustrated dictionary for he learned more through the medium of pictures than text even after he had grasped the significance of the bugs
when he discovered the arrangement of words in alphabetical order he delighted in searching for and finding the combinations with which he was familiar and the words which followed them their definitions led him still further into the mazes of erudition
by the time he was seventeen he had learned to read the simple child's primer and had fully realized the true and wonderful purpose of the little bugs
no longer did he feel shame for his hairless body or his human features for now his reason told him that he was of a different race from his wild and hairy companions
he was a man they were apes and the little apes which scurried through the forest top were monkeys
he knew too that old sabor was a lioness and histah a snake and tantor an elephant  and so he learned to read
from then on his progress was rapid
with the help of the great dictionary and the active intelligence of a healthy mind endowed by inheritance with more than ordinary reasoning powers he shrewdly guessed at much which he could not really understand and more often than not his guesses were close to the mark of truth
there were many breaks in his education caused by the migratory habits of his tribe but even when removed from his books his active brain continued to search out the mysteries of his fascinating avocation
pieces of bark and flat leaves and even smooth stretches of bare earth provided him with copy books whereon to scratch with the point of his hunting knife the lessons he was learning
nor did he neglect the sterner duties of life while following the bent of his inclination toward the solving of the mystery of his library
he practiced with his rope and played with his sharp knife which he had learned to keep keen by whetting upon flat stones
the tribe had grown larger since tarzan had come among them for under the leadership of kerchak they had been able to frighten the other tribes from their part of the jungle so that they had plenty to eat and little or no loss from predatory incursions of neighbors
hence the younger males as they became adult found it more comfortable to take mates from their own tribe or if they captured one of another tribe to bring her back to kerchak's band and live in amity with him rather than attempt to set up new establishments of their own or fight with the redoubtable kerchak for supremacy at home
occasionally one more ferocious than his fellows would attempt this latter alternative but none had come yet who could wrest the palm of victory from the fierce and brutal ape
tarzan held a peculiar position in the tribe
they seemed to consider him one of them and yet in some way different
the older males either ignored him entirely or else hated him so vindictively that but for his wondrous agility and speed and the fierce protection of the huge kala he would have been dispatched at an early age
tublat was his most consistent enemy but it was through tublat that when he was about thirteen the persecution of his enemies suddenly ceased and he was left severely alone except on the occasions when one of them ran amuck in the throes of one of those strange wild fits of insane rage which attacks the males of many of the fiercer animals of the jungle
then none was safe
on the day that tarzan established his right to respect the tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which the jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers in a hollow among some low hills
the open space was almost circular in shape
upon every hand rose the mighty giants of the untouched forest with the matted undergrowth banked so closely between the huge trunks that the only opening into the little level arena was through the upper branches of the trees
here safe from interruption the tribe often gathered
in the center of the amphitheater was one of those strange earthen drums which the anthropoids build for the queer rites the sounds of which men have heard in the fastnesses of the jungle but which none has ever witnessed
many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes and some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of the wild weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle but tarzan lord greystoke is doubtless the only human being who ever joined in the fierce mad intoxicating revel of the dumdum
from this primitive function has arisen unquestionably all the forms and ceremonials of modern church and state for through all the countless ages back beyond the uttermost ramparts of a dawning humanity our fierce hairy forebears danced out the rites of the dumdum to the sound of their earthen drums beneath the bright light of a tropical moon in the depth of a mighty jungle which stands unchanged today as it stood on that long forgotten night in the dim unthinkable vistas of the long dead past when our first shaggy ancestor swung from a swaying bough and dropped lightly upon the soft turf of the first meeting place
on the day that tarzan won his emancipation from the persecution that had followed him remorselessly for twelve of his thirteen years of life the tribe now a full hundred strong trooped silently through the lower terrace of the jungle trees and dropped noiselessly upon the floor of the amphitheater
the rites of the dumdum marked important events in the life of the tribea victory the capture of a prisoner the killing of some large fierce denizen of the jungle the death or accession of a king and were conducted with set ceremonialism
today it was the killing of a giant ape a member of another tribe and as the people of kerchak entered the arena two mighty bulls were seen bearing the body of the vanquished between them
they laid their burden before the earthen drum and then squatted there beside it as guards while the other members of the community curled themselves in grassy nooks to sleep until the rising moon should give the signal for the commencement of their savage orgy
for hours absolute quiet reigned in the little clearing except as it was broken by the discordant notes of brilliantly feathered parrots or the screeching and twittering of the thousand jungle birds flitting ceaselessly amongst the vivid orchids and flamboyant blossoms which festooned the myriad mosscovered branches of the forest kings
at length as darkness settled upon the jungle the apes commenced to bestir themselves and soon they formed a great circle about the earthen drum
the females and young squatted in a thin line at the outer periphery of the circle while just in front of them ranged the adult males
before the drum sat three old females each armed with a knotted branch fifteen or eighteen inches in length
slowly and softly they began tapping upon the resounding surface of the drum as the first faint rays of the ascending moon silvered the encircling tree tops
as the light in the amphitheater increased the females augmented the frequency and force of their blows until presently a wild rhythmic din pervaded the great jungle for miles in every direction
huge fierce brutes stopped in their hunting with uppricked ears and raised heads to listen to the dull booming that betokened the dumdum of the apes
occasionally one would raise his shrill scream or thunderous roar in answering challenge to the savage din of the anthropoids but none came near to investigate or attack for the great apes assembled in all the power of their numbers filled the breasts of their jungle neighbors with deep respect
as the din of the drum rose to almost deafening volume kerchak sprang into the open space between the squatting males and the drummers
standing erect he threw his head far back and looking full into the eye of the rising moon he beat upon his breast with his great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek
onetwicethrice that terrifying cry rang out across the teeming solitude of that unspeakably quick yet unthinkably dead world
then crouching kerchak slunk noiselessly around the open circle veering far away from the dead body lying before the altardrum but as he passed keeping his little fierce wicked red eyes upon the corpse
another male then sprang into the arena and repeating the horrid cries of his king followed stealthily in his wake
another and another followed in quick succession until the jungle reverberated with the now almost ceaseless notes of their bloodthirsty screams
it was the challenge and the hunt
when all the adult males had joined in the thin line of circling dancers the attack commenced
kerchak seizing a huge club from the pile which lay at hand for the purpose rushed furiously upon the dead ape dealing the corpse a terrific blow at the same time emitting the growls and snarls of combat
the din of the drum was now increased as well as the frequency of the blows and the warriors as each approached the victim of the hunt and delivered his bludgeon blow joined in the mad whirl of the death dance
tarzan was one of the wild leaping horde
his brown sweatstreaked muscular body glistening in the moonlight shone supple and graceful among the uncouth awkward hairy brutes about him
none was more stealthy in the mimic hunt none more ferocious than he in the wild ferocity of the attack none who leaped so high into the air in the dance of death
as the noise and rapidity of the drumbeats increased the dancers apparently became intoxicated with the wild rhythm and the savage yells
their leaps and bounds increased their bared fangs dripped saliva and their lips and breasts were flecked with foam
for half an hour the weird dance went on until at a sign from kerchak the noise of the drums ceased the female drummers scampering hurriedly through the line of dancers toward the outer rim of squatting spectators
then as one the males rushed headlong upon the thing which their terrific blows had reduced to a mass of hairy pulp
flesh seldom came to their jaws in satisfying quantities so a fit finale to their wild revel was a taste of fresh killed meat and it was to the purpose of devouring their late enemy that they now turned their attention
great fangs sunk into the carcass tearing away huge hunks the mightiest of the apes obtaining the choicest morsels while the weaker circled the outer edge of the fighting snarling pack awaiting their chance to dodge in and snatch a dropped tidbit or filch a remaining bone before all was gone
tarzan more than the apes craved and needed flesh
descended from a race of meat eaters never in his life he thought had he once satisfied his appetite for animal food and so now his agile little body wormed its way far into the mass of struggling rending apes in an endeavor to obtain a share which his strength would have been unequal to the task of winning for him
at his side hung the hunting knife of his unknown father in a sheath selffashioned in copy of one he had seen among the pictures of his treasurebooks
at last he reached the fast disappearing feast and with his sharp knife slashed off a more generous portion than he had hoped for an entire hairy forearm where it protruded from beneath the feet of the mighty kerchak who was so busily engaged in perpetuating the royal prerogative of gluttony that he failed to note the act of lesemajeste
so little tarzan wriggled out from beneath the struggling mass clutching his grisly prize close to his breast
among those circling futilely the outskirts of the banqueters was old tublat
he had been among the first at the feast but had retreated with a goodly share to eat in quiet and was now forcing his way back for more
so it was that he spied tarzan as the boy emerged from the clawing pushing throng with that hairy forearm hugged firmly to his body
tublat's little closeset bloodshot pigeyes shot wicked gleams of hate as they fell upon the object of his loathing
in them too was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy carried
but tarzan saw his arch enemy as quickly and divining what the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward the females and the young hoping to hide himself among them
tublat however was close upon his heels so that he had no opportunity to seek a place of concealment but saw that he would be put to it to escape at all
swiftly he sped toward the surrounding trees and with an agile bound gained a lower limb with one hand and then transferring his burden to his teeth he climbed rapidly upward closely followed by tublat
up up he went to the waving pinnacle of a lofty monarch of the forest where his heavy pursuer dared not follow him
there he perched hurling taunts and insults at the raging foaming beast fifty feet below him
and then tublat went mad
with horrifying screams and roars he rushed to the ground among the females and young sinking his great fangs into a dozen tiny necks and tearing great pieces from the backs and breasts of the females who fell into his clutches
in the brilliant moonlight tarzan witnessed the whole mad carnival of rage
he saw the females and the young scamper to the safety of the trees
then the great bulls in the center of the arena felt the mighty fangs of their demented fellow and with one accord they melted into the black shadows of the overhanging forest
there was but one in the amphitheater beside tublat a belated female running swiftly toward the tree where tarzan perched and close behind her came the awful tublat
it was kala and as quickly as tarzan saw that tublat was gaining on her he dropped with the rapidity of a falling stone from branch to branch toward his foster mother
now she was beneath the overhanging limbs and close above her crouched tarzan waiting the outcome of the race
she leaped into the air grasping a lowhanging branch but almost over the head of tublat so nearly had he distanced her
she should have been safe now but there was a rending tearing sound the branch broke and precipitated her full upon the head of tublat knocking him to the ground
both were up in an instant but as quick as they had been tarzan had been quicker so that the infuriated bull found himself facing the manchild who stood between him and kala
nothing could have suited the fierce beast better and with a roar of triumph he leaped upon the little lord greystoke
but his fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh
a muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat and another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into the broad breast
like lightning the blows fell and only ceased when tarzan felt the limp form crumple beneath him
as the body rolled to the ground tarzan of the apes placed his foot upon the neck of his lifelong enemy and raising his eyes to the full moon threw back his fierce young head and voiced the wild and terrible cry of his people
one by one the tribe swung down from their arboreal retreats and formed a circle about tarzan and his vanquished foe
when they had all come tarzan turned toward them
i am tarzan he cried
i am a great killer
let all respect tarzan of the apes and kala his mother
there be none among you as mighty as tarzan
let his enemies beware
looking full into the wicked red eyes of kerchak the young lord greystoke beat upon his mighty breast and screamed out once more his shrill cry of defiance
chapter viii  the treetop hunter   the morning after the dumdum the tribe started slowly back through the forest toward the coast
the body of tublat lay where it had fallen for the people of kerchak do not eat their own dead
the march was but a leisurely search for food
cabbage palm and gray plum pisang and scitamine they found in abundance with wild pineapple and occasionally small mammals birds eggs reptiles and insects
the nuts they cracked between their powerful jaws or if too hard broke by pounding between stones
once old sabor crossing their path sent them scurrying to the safety of the higher branches for if she respected their number and their sharp fangs they on their part held her cruel and mighty ferocity in equal esteem
upon a lowhanging branch sat tarzan directly above the majestic supple body as it forged silently through the thick jungle
he hurled a pineapple at the ancient enemy of his people
the great beast stopped and turning eyed the taunting figure above her
with an angry lash of her tail she bared her yellow fangs curling her great lips in a hideous snarl that wrinkled her bristling snout in serried ridges and closed her wicked eyes to two narrow slits of rage and hatred
with backlaid ears she looked straight into the eyes of tarzan of the apes and sounded her fierce shrill challenge
and from the safety of his overhanging limb the apechild sent back the fearsome answer of his kind
for a moment the two eyed each other in silence and then the great cat turned into the jungle which swallowed her as the ocean engulfs a tossed pebble
but into the mind of tarzan a great plan sprang
he had killed the fierce tublat so was he not therefore a mighty fighter
now would he track down the crafty sabor and slay her likewise
he would be a mighty hunter also
at the bottom of his little english heart beat the great desire to cover his nakedness with clothes for he had learned from his picture books that all men were so covered while monkeys and apes and every other living thing went naked
clothes therefore must be truly a badge of greatness the insignia of the superiority of man over all other animals for surely there could be no other reason for wearing the hideous things
many moons ago when he had been much smaller he had desired the skin of sabor the lioness or numa the lion or sheeta the leopard to cover his hairless body that he might no longer resemble hideous histah the snake but now he was proud of his sleek skin for it betokened his descent from a mighty race and the conflicting desires to go naked in prideful proof of his ancestry or to conform to the customs of his own kind and wear hideous and uncomfortable apparel found first one and then the other in the ascendency
as the tribe continued their slow way through the forest after the passing of sabor tarzan's head was filled with his great scheme for slaying his enemy and for many days thereafter he thought of little else
on this day however he presently had other and more immediate interests to attract his attention
suddenly it became as midnight the noises of the jungle ceased the trees stood motionless as though in paralyzed expectancy of some great and imminent disaster
all nature waitedbut not for long
faintly from a distance came a low sad moaning
nearer and nearer it approached mounting louder and louder in volume
the great trees bent in unison as though pressed earthward by a mighty hand
farther and farther toward the ground they inclined and still there was no sound save the deep and awesome moaning of the wind
then suddenly the jungle giants whipped back lashing their mighty tops in angry and deafening protest
a vivid and blinding light flashed from the whirling inky clouds above
the deep cannonade of roaring thunder belched forth its fearsome challenge
the deluge cameall hell broke loose upon the jungle
the tribe shivering from the cold rain huddled at the bases of great trees
the lightning darting and flashing through the blackness showed wildly waving branches whipping streamers and bending trunks
now and again some ancient patriarch of the woods rent by a flashing bolt would crash in a thousand pieces among the surrounding trees carrying down numberless branches and many smaller neighbors to add to the tangled confusion of the tropical jungle
branches great and small torn away by the ferocity of the tornado hurtled through the wildly waving verdure carrying death and destruction to countless unhappy denizens of the thickly peopled world below
for hours the fury of the storm continued without surcease and still the tribe huddled close in shivering fear
in constant danger from falling trunks and branches and paralyzed by the vivid flashing of lightning and the bellowing of thunder they crouched in pitiful misery until the storm passed
the end was as sudden as the beginning
the wind ceased the sun shone forthnature smiled once more
the dripping leaves and branches and the moist petals of gorgeous flowers glistened in the splendor of the returning day
and soas nature forgot her children forgot also
busy life went on as it had been before the darkness and the fright
but to tarzan a dawning light had come to explain the mystery of clothes
how snug he would have been beneath the heavy coat of sabor
and so was added a further incentive to the adventure
for several months the tribe hovered near the beach where stood tarzan's cabin and his studies took up the greater portion of his time but always when journeying through the forest he kept his rope in readiness and many were the smaller animals that fell into the snare of the quick thrown noose
once it fell about the short neck of horta the boar and his mad lunge for freedom toppled tarzan from the overhanging limb where he had lain in wait and from whence he had launched his sinuous coil
the mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body and seeing only the easy prey of a young ape he lowered his head and charged madly at the surprised youth
tarzan happily was uninjured by the fall alighting catlike upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock
he was on his feet in an instant and leaping with the agility of the monkey he was he gained the safety of a low limb as horta the boar rushed futilely beneath
thus it was that tarzan learned by experience the limitations as well as the possibilities of his strange weapon
he lost a long rope on this occasion but he knew that had it been sabor who had thus dragged him from his perch the outcome might have been very different for he would have lost his life doubtless into the bargain
it took him many days to braid a new rope but when finally it was done he went forth purposely to hunt and lie in wait among the dense foliage of a great branch right above the wellbeaten trail that led to water
several small animals passed unharmed beneath him
he did not want such insignificant game
it would take a strong animal to test the efficacy of his new scheme
at last came she whom tarzan sought with lithe sinews rolling beneath shimmering hide fat and glossy came sabor the lioness
her great padded feet fell soft and noiseless on the narrow trail
her head was high in ever alert attention her long tail moved slowly in sinuous and graceful undulations
nearer and nearer she came to where tarzan of the apes crouched upon his limb the coils of his long rope poised ready in his hand
like a thing of bronze motionless as death sat tarzan
sabor passed beneath
one stride beyond she tooka second a third and then the silent coil shot out above her
for an instant the spreading noose hung above her head like a great snake and then as she looked upward to detect the origin of the swishing sound of the rope it settled about her neck
with a quick jerk tarzan snapped the noose tight about the glossy throat and then he dropped the rope and clung to his support with both hands
sabor was trapped
with a bound the startled beast turned into the jungle but tarzan was not to lose another rope through the same cause as the first
he had learned from experience
the lioness had taken but half her second bound when she felt the rope tighten about her neck her body turned completely over in the air and she fell with a heavy crash upon her back
tarzan had fastened the end of the rope securely to the trunk of the great tree on which he sat
thus far his plan had worked to perfection but when he grasped the rope bracing himself behind a crotch of two mighty branches he found that dragging the mighty struggling clawing biting screaming mass of ironmuscled fury up to the tree and hanging her was a very different proposition
the weight of old sabor was immense and when she braced her huge paws nothing less than tantor the elephant himself could have budged her
the lioness was now back in the path where she could see the author of the indignity which had been placed upon her
screaming with rage she suddenly charged leaping high into the air toward tarzan but when her huge body struck the limb on which tarzan had been tarzan was no longer there
instead he perched lightly upon a smaller branch twenty feet above the raging captive
for a moment sabor hung half across the branch while tarzan mocked and hurled twigs and branches at her unprotected face
presently the beast dropped to the earth again and tarzan came quickly to seize the rope but sabor had now found that it was only a slender cord that held her and grasping it in her huge jaws severed it before tarzan could tighten the strangling noose a second time
tarzan was much hurt
his welllaid plan had come to naught so he sat there screaming at the roaring creature beneath him and making mocking grimaces at it
sabor paced back and forth beneath the tree for hours four times she crouched and sprang at the dancing sprite above her but might as well have clutched at the illusive wind that murmured through the tree tops
at last tarzan tired of the sport and with a parting roar of challenge and a wellaimed ripe fruit that spread soft and sticky over the snarling face of his enemy he swung rapidly through the trees a hundred feet above the ground and in a short time was among the members of his tribe
here he recounted the details of his adventure with swelling chest and so considerable swagger that he quite impressed even his bitterest enemies while kala fairly danced for joy and pride
chapter ix  man and man   tarzan of the apes lived on in his wild jungle existence with little change for several years only that he grew stronger and wiser and learned from his books more and more of the strange worlds which lay somewhere outside his primeval forest
to him life was never monotonous or stale
there was always pisah the fish to be caught in the many streams and the little lakes and sabor with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one spent upon the ground
often they hunted him and more often he hunted them but though they never quite reached him with those cruel sharp claws of theirs yet there were times when one could scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his smooth hide
quick was sabor the lioness and quick were numa and sheeta but tarzan of the apes was lightning
with tantor the elephant he made friends
how
ask not
but this is known to the denizens of the jungle that on many moonlight nights tarzan of the apes and tantor the elephant walked together and where the way was clear tarzan rode perched high upon tantor's mighty back
many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his father where still lay untouched the bones of his parents and the skeleton of kala's baby
at eighteen he read fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes on the shelves
also could he write with printed letters rapidly and plainly but script he had not mastered for though there were several copy books among his treasure there was so little written english in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this other form of writing though he could read it laboriously
thus at eighteen we find him an english lordling who could speak no english and yet who could read and write his native language
never had he seen a human being other than himself for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of the interior
high hills shut it off on three sides the ocean on the fourth
it was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous snakes
its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its frontier
but as tarzan of the apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book the ancient security of his jungle was broken forever
at the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung in single file over the brow of a low hill
in advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires and long bows and poisoned arrows
on their backs were oval shields in their noses huge rings while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers
across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of color and on each breast three concentric circles
their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance
following them were several hundred women and children the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking pots household utensils and ivory
in the rear were a hundred warriors similar in all respects to the advance guard
that they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was evidenced by the formation of the column and such was the fact for they were fleeing from the white man's soldiers who had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of his black troops
for many days they had gorged themselves on meat but eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades
that night the black soldiers of the white man had had meat aplenty and this little remnant of a once powerful tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the unknown and freedom
but that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to many of the wild denizens of their new home
for three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the heart of this unknown and untracked forest until finally early in the fourth day they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river which seemed less thickly overgrown than any ground they had yet encountered
here they set to work to build a new village and in a month a great clearing had been made huts and palisades erected plantains yams and maize planted and they had taken up their old life in their new home
here there were no white men no soldiers nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for cruel and thankless taskmasters
several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the territory surrounding their new village
several had already fallen prey to old sabor and because the jungle was so infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats and with lions and leopards the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves far from the safety of their palisades
but one day kulonga a son of the old king mbonga wandered far into the dense mazes to the west
warily he stepped his slender lance ever ready his long oval shield firmly grasped in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body
at his back his bow and in the quiver upon his shield many slim straight arrows well smeared with the thick dark tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick
night found kulonga far from the palisades of his father's village but still headed westward and climbing into the fork of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself for sleep
three miles to the west slept the tribe of kerchak
early the next morning the apes were astir moving through the jungle in search of food
tarzan as was his custom prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by the time he reached the beach
the apes scattered by ones and twos and threes in all directions but ever within sound of a signal of alarm
kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi when the faintest shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention
for fifty yards before her the trail was straight and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a strange and fearful creature
it was kulonga
kala did not wait to see more but turning moved rapidly back along the trail
she did not run but after the manner of her kind when not aroused sought rather to avoid than to escape
close after her came kulonga
here was meat
he could make a killing and feast well this day
on he hurried his spear poised for the throw
at a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again upon another straight stretch
his spear hand went far back the muscles rolled lightninglike beneath the sleek hide
out shot the arm and the spear sped toward kala
a poor cast
it but grazed her side
with a cry of rage and pain the sheape turned upon her tormentor
in an instant the trees were crashing beneath the weight of her hurrying fellows swinging rapidly toward the scene of trouble in answer to kala's scream
as she charged kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an arrow with almost unthinkable quickness
drawing the shaft far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart of the great anthropoid
with a horrid scream kala plunged forward upon her face before the astonished members of her tribe
roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward kulonga but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a frightened antelope
he knew something of the ferocity of these wild hairy men and his one desire was to put as many miles between himself and them as he possibly could
they followed him racing through the trees for a long distance but finally one by one they abandoned the chase and returned to the scene of the tragedy
none of them had ever seen a man before other than tarzan and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of creature it might be that had invaded their jungle
on the far beach by the little cabin tarzan heard the faint echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the direction of the sound
when he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering about the dead body of his slain mother
tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded
he roared out his hideous challenge time and again
he beat upon his great chest with his clenched fists and then he fell upon the body of kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart
to lose the only creature in all his world who ever had manifested love and affection for him was the greatest tragedy he had ever known
what though kala was a fierce and hideous ape
to tarzan she had been kind she had been beautiful
upon her he had lavished unknown to himself all the reverence and respect and love that a normal english boy feels for his own mother
he had never known another and so to kala was given though mutely all that would have belonged to the fair and lovely lady alice had she lived
after the first outburst of grief tarzan controlled himself and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed the killing of kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary could convey
it was enough however for his needs
it told him of a strange hairless black ape with feathers growing upon its head who launched death from a slender branch and then ran with the fleetness of bara the deer toward the rising sun
tarzan waited no longer but leaping into the branches of the trees sped rapidly through the forest
he knew the windings of the elephant trail along which kala's murderer had flown and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous detours of the trail
at his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire and across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope
in an hour he struck the trail again and coming to earth examined the soil minutely
in the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made but much larger than his
his heart beat fast
could it be that he was trailing a manone of his own race
there were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions
so his quarry had already passed on his return along the trail
as he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to the bottom of its shallow depressionah the trail was very fresh his prey must have but scarcely passed
tarzan swung himself to the trees once more and with swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail
he had covered barely a mile when he came upon the black warrior standing in a little open space
in his hand was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing arrows
opposite him across the little clearing stood horta the boar with lowered head and foam flecked tusks ready to charge
tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath himso like him in form and yet so different in face and color
his books had portrayed the negro but how different had been the dull dead print to this sleek thing of ebony pulsing with life
as the man stood there with taut drawn bow tarzan recognized him not so much the negro as the archer of his picture book                a stands for archer   how wonderful
tarzan almost betrayed his presence in the deep excitement of his discovery
but things were commencing to happen below him
the sinewy black arm had drawn the shaft far back horta the boar was charging and then the black released the little poisoned arrow and tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar
scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere kulonga had fitted another to it but horta the boar was upon him so quickly that he had no time to discharge it
with a bound the black leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in horta's back
then kulonga sprang into a nearby tree
horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more a dozen steps he took then he staggered and fell upon his side
for a moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively then he lay still
kulonga came down from his tree
with a knife that hung at his side he cut several large pieces from the boar's body and in the center of the trail he built a fire cooking and eating as much as he wanted
the rest he left where it had fallen
tarzan was an interested spectator
his desire to kill burned fiercely in his wild breast but his desire to learn was even greater
he would follow this savage creature for a while and know from whence he came
he could kill him at his leisure later when the bow and deadly arrows were laid aside
when kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond a near turning of the path tarzan dropped quietly to the ground
with his knife he severed many strips of meat from horta's carcass but he did not cook them
he had seen fire but only when ara the lightning had destroyed some great tree
that any creature of the jungle could produce the redandyellow fangs which devoured wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised tarzan greatly and why the black warrior had ruined his delicious repast by plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him
possibly ara was a friend with whom the archer was sharing his food
but be that as it may tarzan would not ruin good meat in any such foolish manner so he gobbled down a great quantity of the raw flesh burying the balance of the carcass beside the trail where he could find it upon his return
and then lord greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon his naked thighs and took up the trail of kulonga the son of mbonga the king while in faroff london another lord greystoke the younger brother of the real lord greystoke's father sent back his chops to the club's chef because they were underdone and when he had finished his repast he dipped his fingerends into a silver bowl of scented water and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask
all day tarzan followed kulonga hovering above him in the trees like some malign spirit
twice more he saw him hurl his arrows of destructiononce at dango the hyena and again at manu the monkey
in each instance the animal died almost instantly for kulonga's poison was very fresh and very deadly
tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his quarry
he knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle who were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with their jungle neighbors yet as often recovered as not
no there was something mysterious connected with these tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere scratch
he must look into the matter
that night kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree and far above him crouched tarzan of the apes
when kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared
the black warrior was furious and frightened but more frightened than furious
he searched the ground below the tree and he searched the tree above the ground but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder
kulonga was panicstricken
his spear he had hurled at kala and had not recovered and now that his bow and arrows were gone he was defenseless except for a single knife
his only hope lay in reaching the village of mbonga as quickly as his legs would carry him
that he was not far from home he was certain so he took the trail at a rapid trot
from a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away emerged tarzan of the apes to swing quietly in his wake
kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up
thus tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches
as kulonga continued his journey tarzan closed on him until he traveled almost over the black's head
his rope he now held coiled in his right hand he was almost ready for the kill
the moment was delayed only because tarzan was anxious to ascertain the black warrior's destination and presently he was rewarded for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing at one end of which lay many strange lairs
tarzan was directly over kulonga as he made the discovery
the forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village
tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone but tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even room for the shadow of a thought between
so it was that as kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of mbonga and ere the king's son had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his neck
so quickly did tarzan of the apes drag back his prey that kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe
hand over hand tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by his neck in midair then tarzan climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering verdure of the tree
here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch and then descending plunged his hunting knife into kulonga's heart
kala was avenged
tarzan examined the black minutely for he had never seen any other human being
the knife with its sheath and belt caught his eye he appropriated them
a copper anklet also took his fancy and this he transferred to his own leg
he examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast
he marveled at the sharp filed teeth
he investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress and then he prepared to get down to business for tarzan of the apes was hungry and here was meat meat of the kill which jungle ethics permitted him to eat
how may we judge him by what standards this apeman with the heart and head and body of an english gentleman and the training of a wild beast
tublat whom he had hated and who had hated him he had killed in a fair fight and yet never had the thought of eating tublat's flesh entered his head
it would have been as revolting to him as is cannibalism to us
but who was kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as horta the boar or bara the deer
was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger
suddenly a strange doubt stayed his hand
had not his books taught him that he was a man
and was not the archer a man also
did men eat men
alas he did not know
why then this hesitancy
once more he essayed the effort but a qualm of nausea overwhelmed him
he did not understand
all he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black man and thus hereditary instinct ages old usurped the functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant
quickly he lowered kulonga's body to the ground removed the noose and took to the trees again
chapter x  the fearphantom   from a lofty perch tarzan viewed the village of thatched huts across the intervening plantation
he saw that at one point the forest touched the village and to this spot he made his way lured by a fever of curiosity to behold animals of his own kind and to learn more of their ways and view the strange lairs in which they lived
his savage life among the fierce wild brutes of the jungle left no opening for any thought that these could be aught else than enemies
similarity of form led him into no erroneous conception of the welcome that would be accorded him should he be discovered by these the first of his own kind he had ever seen
tarzan of the apes was no sentimentalist
he knew nothing of the brotherhood of man
all things outside his own tribe were his deadly enemies with the few exceptions of which tantor the elephant was a marked example
and he realized all this without malice or hatred
to kill was the law of the wild world he knew
few were his primitive pleasures but the greatest of these was to hunt and kill and so he accorded to others the right to cherish the same desires as he even though he himself might be the object of their hunt
his strange life had left him neither morose nor bloodthirsty
that he joyed in killing and that he killed with a joyous laugh upon his handsome lips betokened no innate cruelty
he killed for food most often but being a man he sometimes killed for pleasure a thing which no other animal does for it has remained for man alone among all creatures to kill senselessly and wantonly for the mere pleasure of inflicting suffering and death
and when he killed for revenge or in selfdefense he did that also without hysteria for it was a very businesslike proceeding which admitted of no levity
so it was that now as he cautiously approached the village of mbonga he was quite prepared either to kill or be killed should he be discovered
he proceeded with unwonted stealth for kulonga had taught him great respect for the little sharp splinters of wood which dealt death so swiftly and unerringly
at length he came to a great tree heavy laden with thick foliage and loaded with pendant loops of giant creepers
from this almost impenetrable bower above the village he crouched looking down upon the scene below him wondering over every feature of this new strange life
there were naked children running and playing in the village street
there were women grinding dried plantain in crude stone mortars while others were fashioning cakes from the powdered flour
out in the fields he could see still other women hoeing weeding or gathering
all wore strange protruding girdles of dried grass about their hips and many were loaded with brass and copper anklets armlets and bracelets
around many a dusky neck hung curiously coiled strands of wire while several were further ornamented by huge nose rings
tarzan of the apes looked with growing wonder at these strange creatures
dozing in the shade he saw several men while at the extreme outskirts of the clearing he occasionally caught glimpses of armed warriors apparently guarding the village against surprise from an attacking enemy
he noticed that the women alone worked
nowhere was there evidence of a man tilling the fields or performing any of the homely duties of the village
finally his eyes rested upon a woman directly beneath him
before her was a small cauldron standing over a low fire and in it bubbled a thick reddish tarry mass
on one side of her lay a quantity of wooden arrows the points of which she dipped into the seething substance then laying them upon a narrow rack of boughs which stood upon her other side
tarzan of the apes was fascinated
here was the secret of the terrible destructiveness of the archer's tiny missiles
he noted the extreme care which the woman took that none of the matter should touch her hands and once when a particle spattered upon one of her fingers he saw her plunge the member into a vessel of water and quickly rub the tiny stain away with a handful of leaves
tarzan knew nothing of poison but his shrewd reasoning told him that it was this deadly stuff that killed and not the little arrow which was merely the messenger that carried it into the body of its victim
how he should like to have more of those little deathdealing slivers
if the woman would only leave her work for an instant he could drop down gather up a handful and be back in the tree again before she drew three breaths
as he was trying to think out some plan to distract her attention he heard a wild cry from across the clearing
he looked and saw a black warrior standing beneath the very tree in which he had killed the murderer of kala an hour before
the fellow was shouting and waving his spear above his head
now and again he would point to something on the ground before him
the village was in an uproar instantly
armed men rushed from the interior of many a hut and raced madly across the clearing toward the excited sentry
after them trooped the old men and the women and children until in a moment the village was deserted
tarzan of the apes knew that they had found the body of his victim but that interested him far less than the fact that no one remained in the village to prevent his taking a supply of the arrows which lay below him
quickly and noiselessly he dropped to the ground beside the cauldron of poison
for a moment he stood motionless his quick bright eyes scanning the interior of the palisade
no one was in sight
his eyes rested upon the open doorway of a nearby hut
he would take a look within thought tarzan and so cautiously he approached the low thatched building
for a moment he stood without listening intently
there was no sound and he glided into the semidarkness of the interior
weapons hung against the wallslong spears strangely shaped knives a couple of narrow shields
in the center of the room was a cooking pot and at the far end a litter of dry grasses covered by woven mats which evidently served the owners as beds and bedding
several human skulls lay upon the floor
tarzan of the apes felt of each article hefted the spears smelled of them for he saw largely through his sensitive and highly trained nostrils
he determined to own one of these long pointed sticks but he could not take one on this trip because of the arrows he meant to carry
as he took each article from the walls he placed it in a pile in the center of the room
on top of all he placed the cooking pot inverted and on top of this he laid one of the grinning skulls upon which he fastened the headdress of the dead kulonga
then he stood back surveyed his work and grinned
tarzan of the apes enjoyed a joke
but now he heard outside the sounds of many voices and long mournful howls and mighty wailing
he was startled
had he remained too long
quickly he reached the doorway and peered down the village street toward the village gate
the natives were not yet in sight though he could plainly hear them approaching across the plantation
they must be very near
like a flash he sprang across the opening to the pile of arrows
gathering up all he could carry under one arm he overturned the seething cauldron with a kick and disappeared into the foliage above just as the first of the returning natives entered the gate at the far end of the village street
then he turned to watch the proceeding below poised like some wild bird ready to take swift wing at the first sign of danger
the natives filed up the street four of them bearing the dead body of kulonga
behind trailed the women uttering strange cries and weird lamentation
on they came to the portals of kulonga's hut the very one in which tarzan had wrought his depredations
scarcely had half a dozen entered the building ere they came rushing out in wild jabbering confusion
the others hastened to gather about
there was much excited gesticulating pointing and chattering then several of the warriors approached and peered within
finally an old fellow with many ornaments of metal about his arms and legs and a necklace of dried human hands depending upon his chest entered the hut
it was mbonga the king father of kulonga
for a few moments all was silent
then mbonga emerged a look of mingled wrath and superstitious fear writ upon his hideous countenance
he spoke a few words to the assembled warriors and in an instant the men were flying through the little village searching minutely every hut and corner within the palisades
scarcely had the search commenced than the overturned cauldron was discovered and with it the theft of the poisoned arrows
nothing more they found and it was a thoroughly awed and frightened group of savages which huddled around their king a few moments later
mbonga could explain nothing of the strange events that had taken place
the finding of the still warm body of kulongaon the very verge of their fields and within easy earshot of the villageknifed and stripped at the door of his father's home was in itself sufficiently mysterious but these last awesome discoveries within the village within the dead kulonga's own hut filled their hearts with dismay and conjured in their poor brains only the most frightful of superstitious explanations
they stood in little groups talking in low tones and ever casting affrighted glances behind them from their great rolling eyes
tarzan of the apes watched them for a while from his lofty perch in the great tree
there was much in their demeanor which he could not understand for of superstition he was ignorant and of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception
the sun was high in the heavens
tarzan had not broken fast this day and it was many miles to where lay the toothsome remains of horta the boar
so he turned his back upon the village of mbonga and melted away into the leafy fastness of the forest
chapter xi  king of the apes   it was not yet dark when he reached the tribe though he stopped to exhume and devour the remains of the wild boar he had cached the preceding day and again to take kulonga's bow and arrows from the tree top in which he had hidden them
it was a wellladen tarzan who dropped from the branches into the midst of the tribe of kerchak
with swelling chest he narrated the glories of his adventure and exhibited the spoils of conquest
kerchak grunted and turned away for he was jealous of this strange member of his band
in his little evil brain he sought for some excuse to wreak his hatred upon tarzan
the next day tarzan was practicing with his bow and arrows at the first gleam of dawn
at first he lost nearly every bolt he shot but finally he learned to guide the little shafts with fair accuracy and ere a month had passed he was no mean shot but his proficiency had cost him nearly his entire supply of arrows
the tribe continued to find the hunting good in the vicinity of the beach and so tarzan of the apes varied his archery practice with further investigation of his father's choice though little store of books
it was during this period that the young english lord found hidden in the back of one of the cupboards in the cabin a small metal box
the key was in the lock and a few moments of investigation and experimentation were rewarded with the successful opening of the receptacle
in it he found a faded photograph of a smooth faced young man a golden locket studded with diamonds linked to a small gold chain a few letters and a small book
tarzan examined these all minutely
the photograph he liked most of all for the eyes were smiling and the face was open and frank
it was his father
the locket too took his fancy and he placed the chain about his neck in imitation of the ornamentation he had seen to be so common among the black men he had visited
the brilliant stones gleamed strangely against his smooth brown hide
the letters he could scarcely decipher for he had learned little or nothing of script so he put them back in the box with the photograph and turned his attention to the book
this was almost entirely filled with fine script but while the little bugs were all familiar to him their arrangement and the combinations in which they occurred were strange and entirely incomprehensible
tarzan had long since learned the use of the dictionary but much to his sorrow and perplexity it proved of no avail to him in this emergency
not a word of all that was writ in the book could he find and so he put it back in the metal box but with a determination to work out the mysteries of it later on
little did he know that this book held between its covers the key to his originthe answer to the strange riddle of his strange life
it was the diary of john clayton lord greystokekept in french as had always been his custom
tarzan replaced the box in the cupboard but always thereafter he carried the features of the strong smiling face of his father in his heart and in his head a fixed determination to solve the mystery of the strange words in the little black book
at present he had more important business in hand for his supply of arrows was exhausted and he must needs journey to the black men's village and renew it
early the following morning he set out and traveling rapidly he came before midday to the clearing
once more he took up his position in the great tree and as before he saw the women in the fields and the village street and the cauldron of bubbling poison directly beneath him
for hours he lay awaiting his opportunity to drop down unseen and gather up the arrows for which he had come but nothing now occurred to call the villagers away from their homes
the day wore on and still tarzan of the apes crouched above the unsuspecting woman at the cauldron
presently the workers in the fields returned
the hunting warriors emerged from the forest and when all were within the palisade the gates were closed and barred
many cooking pots were now in evidence about the village
before each hut a woman presided over a boiling stew while little cakes of plantain and cassava puddings were to be seen on every hand
suddenly there came a hail from the edge of the clearing
tarzan looked
it was a party of belated hunters returning from the north and among them they half led half carried a struggling animal
as they approached the village the gates were thrown open to admit them and then as the people saw the victim of the chase a savage cry rose to the heavens for the quarry was a man
as he was dragged still resisting into the village street the women and children set upon him with sticks and stones and tarzan of the apes young and savage beast of the jungle wondered at the cruel brutality of his own kind
sheeta the leopard alone of all the jungle folk tortured his prey
the ethics of all the others meted a quick and merciful death to their victims
tarzan had learned from his books but scattered fragments of the ways of human beings
when he had followed kulonga through the forest he had expected to come to a city of strange houses on wheels puffing clouds of black smoke from a huge tree stuck in the roof of one of themor to a sea covered with mighty floating buildings which he had learned were called variously ships and boats and steamers and craft
he had been sorely disappointed with the poor little village of the blacks hidden away in his own jungle and with not a single house as large as his own cabin upon the distant beach
he saw that these people were more wicked than his own apes and as savage and cruel as sabor herself
tarzan began to hold his own kind in low esteem
now they had tied their poor victim to a great post near the center of the village directly before mbonga's hut and here they formed a dancing yelling circle of warriors about him alive with flashing knives and menacing spears
in a larger circle squatted the women yelling and beating upon drums
it reminded tarzan of the dumdum and so he knew what to expect
he wondered if they would spring upon their meat while it was still alive
the apes did not do such things as that
the circle of warriors about the cringing captive drew closer and closer to their prey as they danced in wild and savage abandon to the maddening music of the drums
presently a spear reached out and pricked the victim
it was the signal for fifty others
eyes ears arms and legs were pierced every inch of the poor writhing body that did not cover a vital organ became the target of the cruel lancers
the women and children shrieked their delight
the warriors licked their hideous lips in anticipation of the feast to come and vied with one another in the savagery and loathsomeness of the cruel indignities with which they tortured the still conscious prisoner
then it was that tarzan of the apes saw his chance
all eyes were fixed upon the thrilling spectacle at the stake
the light of day had given place to the darkness of a moonless night and only the fires in the immediate vicinity of the orgy had been kept alight to cast a restless glow upon the restless scene
gently the lithe boy dropped to the soft earth at the end of the village street
quickly he gathered up the arrowsall of them this time for he had brought a number of long fibers to bind them into a bundle
without haste he wrapped them securely and then ere he turned to leave the devil of capriciousness entered his heart
he looked about for some hint of a wild prank to play upon these strange grotesque creatures that they might be again aware of his presence among them
dropping his bundle of arrows at the foot of the tree tarzan crept among the shadows at the side of the street until he came to the same hut he had entered on the occasion of his first visit
inside all was darkness but his groping hands soon found the object for which he sought and without further delay he turned again toward the door
he had taken but a step however ere his quick ear caught the sound of approaching footsteps immediately without
in another instant the figure of a woman darkened the entrance of the hut
tarzan drew back silently to the far wall and his hand sought the long keen hunting knife of his father
the woman came quickly to the center of the hut
there she paused for an instant feeling about with her hands for the thing she sought
evidently it was not in its accustomed place for she explored ever nearer and nearer the wall where tarzan stood
so close was she now that the apeman felt the animal warmth of her naked body
up went the hunting knife and then the woman turned to one side and soon a guttural ah proclaimed that her search had at last been successful
immediately she turned and left the hut and as she passed through the doorway tarzan saw that she carried a cooking pot in her hand
he followed closely after her and as he reconnoitered from the shadows of the doorway he saw that all the women of the village were hastening to and from the various huts with pots and kettles
these they were filling with water and placing over a number of fires near the stake where the dying victim now hung an inert and bloody mass of suffering
choosing a moment when none seemed near tarzan hastened to his bundle of arrows beneath the great tree at the end of the village street
as on the former occasion he overthrew the cauldron before leaping sinuous and catlike into the lower branches of the forest giant
silently he climbed to a great height until he found a point where he could look through a leafy opening upon the scene beneath him
the women were now preparing the prisoner for their cooking pots while the men stood about resting after the fatigue of their mad revel
comparative quiet reigned in the village
tarzan raised aloft the thing he had pilfered from the hut and with aim made true by years of fruit and coconut throwing launched it toward the group of savages
squarely among them it fell striking one of the warriors full upon the head and felling him to the ground
then it rolled among the women and stopped beside the halfbutchered thing they were preparing to feast upon
all gazed in consternation at it for an instant and then with one accord broke and ran for their huts
it was a grinning human skull which looked up at them from the ground
the dropping of the thing out of the open sky was a miracle well aimed to work upon their superstitious fears
thus tarzan of the apes left them filled with terror at this new manifestation of the presence of some unseen and unearthly evil power which lurked in the forest about their village
later when they discovered the overturned cauldron and that once more their arrows had been pilfered it commenced to dawn upon them that they had offended some great god by placing their village in this part of the jungle without propitiating him
from then on an offering of food was daily placed below the great tree from whence the arrows had disappeared in an effort to conciliate the mighty one
but the seed of fear was deep sown and had he but known it tarzan of the apes had laid the foundation for much future misery for himself and his tribe
that night he slept in the forest not far from the village and early the next morning set out slowly on his homeward march hunting as he traveled
only a few berries and an occasional grub worm rewarded his search and he was half famished when looking up from a log he had been rooting beneath he saw sabor the lioness standing in the center of the trail not twenty paces from him
the great yellow eyes were fixed upon him with a wicked and baleful gleam and the red tongue licked the longing lips as sabor crouched worming her stealthy way with belly flattened against the earth
tarzan did not attempt to escape
he welcomed the opportunity for which in fact he had been searching for days past now that he was armed with something more than a rope of grass
quickly he unslung his bow and fitted a welldaubed arrow and as sabor sprang the tiny missile leaped to meet her in midair
at the same instant tarzan of the apes jumped to one side and as the great cat struck the ground beyond him another deathtipped arrow sunk deep into sabor's loin
with a mighty roar the beast turned and charged once more only to be met with a third arrow full in one eye but this time she was too close to the apeman for the latter to sidestep the onrushing body
tarzan of the apes went down beneath the great body of his enemy but with gleaming knife drawn and striking home
for a moment they lay there and then tarzan realized that the inert mass lying upon him was beyond power ever again to injure man or ape
with difficulty he wriggled from beneath the great weight and as he stood erect and gazed down upon the trophy of his skill a mighty wave of exultation swept over him
with swelling breast he placed a foot upon the body of his powerful enemy and throwing back his fine young head roared out the awful challenge of the victorious bull ape
the forest echoed to the savage and triumphant paean
birds fell still and the larger animals and beasts of prey slunk stealthily away for few there were of all the jungle who sought for trouble with the great anthropoids
and in london another lord greystoke was speaking to his kind in the house of lords but none trembled at the sound of his soft voice
sabor proved unsavory eating even to tarzan of the apes but hunger served as a most efficacious disguise to toughness and rank taste and ere long with wellfilled stomach the apeman was ready to sleep again
first however he must remove the hide for it was as much for this as for any other purpose that he had desired to destroy sabor
deftly he removed the great pelt for he had practiced often on smaller animals
when the task was finished he carried his trophy to the fork of a high tree and there curling himself securely in a crotch he fell into deep and dreamless slumber
what with loss of sleep arduous exercise and a full belly tarzan of the apes slept the sun around awakening about noon of the following day
he straightway repaired to the carcass of sabor but was angered to find the bones picked clean by other hungry denizens of the jungle
half an hour's leisurely progress through the forest brought to sight a young deer and before the little creature knew that an enemy was near a tiny arrow had lodged in its neck
so quickly the virus worked that at the end of a dozen leaps the deer plunged headlong into the undergrowth dead
again did tarzan feast well but this time he did not sleep
instead he hastened on toward the point where he had left the tribe and when he had found them proudly exhibited the skin of sabor the lioness
look
he cried apes of kerchak
see what tarzan the mighty killer has done
who else among you has ever killed one of numa's people
tarzan is mightiest amongst you for tarzan is no ape
tarzan is  but here he stopped for in the language of the anthropoids there was no word for man and tarzan could only write the word in english he could not pronounce it
the tribe had gathered about to look upon the proof of his wondrous prowess and to listen to his words
only kerchak hung back nursing his hatred and his rage
suddenly something snapped in the wicked little brain of the anthropoid
with a frightful roar the great beast sprang among the assemblage
biting and striking with his huge hands he killed and maimed a dozen ere the balance could escape to the upper terraces of the forest
frothing and shrieking in the insanity of his fury kerchak looked about for the object of his greatest hatred and there upon a nearby limb he saw him sitting
come down tarzan great killer cried kerchak
come down and feel the fangs of a greater
do mighty fighters fly to the trees at the first approach of danger
and then kerchak emitted the volleying challenge of his kind
quietly tarzan dropped to the ground
breathlessly the tribe watched from their lofty perches as kerchak still roaring charged the relatively puny figure
nearly seven feet stood kerchak on his short legs
his enormous shoulders were bunched and rounded with huge muscles
the back of his short neck was as a single lump of iron sinew which bulged beyond the base of his skull so that his head seemed like a small ball protruding from a huge mountain of flesh
his backdrawn snarling lips exposed his great fighting fangs and his little wicked bloodshot eyes gleamed in horrid reflection of his madness
awaiting him stood tarzan himself a mighty muscled animal but his six feet of height and his great rolling sinews seemed pitifully inadequate to the ordeal which awaited them
his bow and arrows lay some distance away where he had dropped them while showing sabor's hide to his fellow apes so that he confronted kerchak now with only his hunting knife and his superior intellect to offset the ferocious strength of his enemy
as his antagonist came roaring toward him lord greystoke tore his long knife from its sheath and with an answering challenge as horrid and bloodcurdling as that of the beast he faced rushed swiftly to meet the attack
he was too shrewd to allow those long hairy arms to encircle him and just as their bodies were about to crash together tarzan of the apes grasped one of the huge wrists of his assailant and springing lightly to one side drove his knife to the hilt into kerchak's body below the heart
before he could wrench the blade free again the bull's quick lunge to seize him in those awful arms had torn the weapon from tarzan's grasp
kerchak aimed a terrific blow at the apeman's head with the flat of his hand a blow which had it landed might easily have crushed in the side of tarzan's skull
the man was too quick and ducking beneath it himself delivered a mighty one with clenched fist in the pit of kerchak's stomach
the ape was staggered and what with the mortal wound in his side had almost collapsed when with one mighty effort he rallied for an instantjust long enough to enable him to wrest his arm free from tarzan's grasp and close in a terrific clinch with his wiry opponent
straining the apeman close to him his great jaws sought tarzan's throat but the young lord's sinewy fingers were at kerchak's own before the cruel fangs could close on the sleek brown skin
thus they struggled the one to crush out his opponent's life with those awful teeth the other to close forever the windpipe beneath his strong grasp while he held the snarling mouth from him
the greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing and the teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from tarzan's throat when with a shuddering tremor the great body stiffened for an instant and then sank limply to the ground
kerchak was dead
withdrawing the knife that had so often rendered him master of far mightier muscles than his own tarzan of the apes placed his foot upon the neck of his vanquished enemy and once again loud through the forest rang the fierce wild cry of the conqueror
and thus came the young lord greystoke into the kingship of the apes
chapter xii  man's reason   there was one of the tribe of tarzan who questioned his authority and that was terkoz the son of tublat but he so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms tarzan knew however that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the kingship from him by some sudden stroke of treachery and so he was ever on his guard against surprise
for months the life of the little band went on much as it had before except that tarzan's greater intelligence and his ability as a hunter were the means of providing for them more bountifully than ever before
most of them therefore were more than content with the change in rulers
tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men and there warned by their chief's superior wisdom they ate only what they required nor ever did they destroy what they could not eat as is the way of manu the monkey and of most apes
so while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering of their fields they were not discouraged in their efforts to cultivate the land as would have been the case had tarzan permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly
during this period tarzan paid many nocturnal visits to the village where he often renewed his supply of arrows
he soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which was his avenue into the palisade and after a little he commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there
when the awestruck savages saw that the food disappeared overnight they were filled with consternation and dread for it was one thing to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil but quite another thing to have the spirit really come into the village and eat it
such a thing was unheard of and it clouded their superstitious minds with all manner of vague fears
nor was this all
the periodic disappearance of their arrows and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands had wrought them to such a state that life had become a veritable burden in their new home and now it was that mbonga and his head men began to talk of abandoning the village and seeking a site farther on in the jungle
presently the black warriors began to strike farther and farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to hunt looking for a site for a new village
more often was the tribe of tarzan disturbed by these wandering huntsmen
now was the quiet fierce solitude of the primeval forest broken by new strange cries
no longer was there safety for bird or beast
man had come
other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and by nightfierce cruel beastsbut their weaker neighbors only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when the danger was past
with man it is different
when he comes many of the larger animals instinctively leave the district entirely seldom if ever to return and thus it has always been with the great anthropoids
they flee man as man flees a pestilence
for a short time the tribe of tarzan lingered in the vicinity of the beach because their new chief hated the thought of leaving the treasured contents of the little cabin forever
but when one day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in great numbers on the banks of a little stream that had been their watering place for generations and in the act of clearing a space in the jungle and erecting many huts the apes would remain no longer and so tarzan led them inland for many marches to a spot as yet undefiled by the foot of a human being
once every moon tarzan would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with his books and to replenish his supply of arrows
this latter task was becoming more and more difficult for the blacks had taken to hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts
this necessitated watching by day on tarzan's part to discover where the arrows were being concealed
twice had he entered huts at night while the inmates lay sleeping upon their mats and stolen the arrows from the very sides of the warriors
but this method he realized to be too fraught with danger and so he commenced picking up solitary hunters with his long deadly noose stripping them of weapons and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into the village street during the still watches of the night
these various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that had it not been for the monthly respite between tarzan's visits in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each fresh incursion would prove the last they soon would have abandoned their new village
the blacks had not as yet come upon tarzan's cabin on the distant beach but the apeman lived in constant dread that while he was away with the tribe they would discover and despoil his treasure
so it came that he spent more and more time in the vicinity of his father's last home and less and less with the tribe
presently the members of his little community began to suffer on account of his neglect for disputes and quarrels constantly arose which only the king might settle peaceably
at last some of the older apes spoke to tarzan on the subject and for a month thereafter he remained constantly with the tribe
the duties of kingship among the anthropoids are not many or arduous
in the afternoon comes thaka possibly to complain that old mungo has stolen his new wife
then must tarzan summon all before him and if he finds that the wife prefers her new lord he commands that matters remain as they are or possibly that mungo give thaka one of his daughters in exchange
whatever his decision the apes accept it as final and return to their occupations satisfied
then comes tana shrieking and holding tight her side from which blood is streaming
gunto her husband has cruelly bitten her
and gunto summoned says that tana is lazy and will not bring him nuts and beetles or scratch his back for him
so tarzan scolds them both and threatens gunto with a taste of the deathbearing slivers if he abuses tana further and tana for her part is compelled to promise better attention to her wifely duties
and so it goes little family differences for the most part which if left unsettled would result finally in greater factional strife and the eventual dismemberment of the tribe
but tarzan tired of it as he found that kingship meant the curtailment of his liberty
he longed for the little cabin and the sunkissed seafor the cool interior of the wellbuilt house and for the neverending wonders of the many books
as he had grown older he found that he had grown away from his people
their interests and his were far removed
they had not kept pace with him nor could they understand aught of the many strange and wonderful dreams that passed through the active brain of their human king
so limited was their vocabulary that tarzan could not even talk with them of the many new truths and the great fields of thought that his reading had opened up before his longing eyes or make known ambitions which stirred his soul
among the tribe he no longer had friends as of old
a little child may find companionship in many strange and simple creatures but to a grown man there must be some semblance of equality in intellect as the basis for agreeable association
had kala lived tarzan would have sacrificed all else to remain near her but now that she was dead and the playful friends of his childhood grown into fierce and surly brutes he felt that he much preferred the peace and solitude of his cabin to the irksome duties of leadership amongst a horde of wild beasts
the hatred and jealousy of terkoz son of tublat did much to counteract the effect of tarzan's desire to renounce his kingship among the apes for stubborn young englishman that he was he could not bring himself to retreat in the face of so malignant an enemy
that terkoz would be chosen leader in his stead he knew full well for time and again the ferocious brute had established his claim to physical supremacy over the few bull apes who had dared resent his savage bullying
tarzan would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without recourse to knife or arrows
so much had his great strength and agility increased in the period following his maturity that he had come to believe that he might master the redoubtable terkoz in a hand to hand fight were it not for the terrible advantage the anthropoid's huge fighting fangs gave him over the poorly armed tarzan
the entire matter was taken out of tarzan's hands one day by force of circumstances and his future left open to him so that he might go or stay without any stain upon his savage escutcheon
it happened thus  the tribe was feeding quietly spread over a considerable area when a great screaming arose some distance east of where tarzan lay upon his belly beside a limpid brook attempting to catch an elusive fish in his quick brown hands
with one accord the tribe swung rapidly toward the frightened cries and there found terkoz holding an old female by the hair and beating her unmercifully with his great hands
as tarzan approached he raised his hand aloft for terkoz to desist for the female was not his but belonged to a poor old ape whose fighting days were long over and who therefore could not protect his family
terkoz knew that it was against the laws of his kind to strike this woman of another but being a bully he had taken advantage of the weakness of the female's husband to chastise her because she had refused to give up to him a tender young rodent she had captured
when terkoz saw tarzan approaching without his arrows he continued to belabor the poor woman in a studied effort to affront his hated chieftain
tarzan did not repeat his warning signal but instead rushed bodily upon the waiting terkoz
never had the apeman fought so terrible a battle since that longgone day when bolgani the great king gorilla had so horribly manhandled him ere the newfound knife had by accident pricked the savage heart
tarzan's knife on the present occasion but barely offset the gleaming fangs of terkoz and what little advantage the ape had over the man in brute strength was almost balanced by the latter's wonderful quickness and agility
in the sum total of their points however the anthropoid had a shade the better of the battle and had there been no other personal attribute to influence the final outcome tarzan of the apes the young lord greystoke would have died as he had livedan unknown savage beast in equatorial africa
but there was that which had raised him far above his fellows of the junglethat little spark which spells the whole vast difference between man and brutereason
this it was which saved him from death beneath the iron muscles and tearing fangs of terkoz
scarcely had they fought a dozen seconds ere they were rolling upon the ground striking tearing and rendingtwo great savage beasts battling to the death
terkoz had a dozen knife wounds on head and breast and tarzan was torn and bleedinghis scalp in one place half torn from his head so that a great piece hung down over one eye obstructing his vision
but so far the young englishman had been able to keep those horrible fangs from his jugular and now as they fought less fiercely for a moment to regain their breath tarzan formed a cunning plan
he would work his way to the other's back and clinging there with tooth and nail drive his knife home until terkoz was no more
the maneuver was accomplished more easily than he had hoped for the stupid beast not knowing what tarzan was attempting made no particular effort to prevent the accomplishment of the design
but when finally he realized that his antagonist was fastened to him where his teeth and fists alike were useless against him terkoz hurled himself about upon the ground so violently that tarzan could but cling desperately to the leaping turning twisting body and ere he had struck a blow the knife was hurled from his hand by a heavy impact against the earth and tarzan found himself defenseless
during the rollings and squirmings of the next few minutes tarzan's hold was loosened a dozen times until finally an accidental circumstance of those swift and everchanging evolutions gave him a new hold with his right hand which he realized was absolutely unassailable
his arm was passed beneath terkoz's arm from behind and his hand and forearm encircled the back of terkoz's neck
it was the halfnelson of modern wrestling which the untaught apeman had stumbled upon but superior reason showed him in an instant the value of the thing he had discovered
it was the difference to him between life and death
and so he struggled to encompass a similar hold with the left hand and in a few moments terkoz's bull neck was creaking beneath a fullnelson
there was no more lunging about now
the two lay perfectly still upon the ground tarzan upon terkoz's back
slowly the bullet head of the ape was being forced lower and lower upon his chest
tarzan knew what the result would be
in an instant the neck would break
then there came to terkoz's rescue the same thing that had put him in these sore straitsa man's reasoning power
if i kill him thought tarzan what advantage will it be to me
will it not rob the tribe of a great fighter
and if terkoz be dead he will know nothing of my supremacy while alive he will ever be an example to the other apes
kagoda
hissed tarzan in terkoz's ear which in ape tongue means freely translated  do you surrender
for a moment there was no reply and tarzan added a few more ounces of pressure which elicited a horrified shriek of pain from the great beast
kagoda
repeated tarzan
kagoda
cried terkoz
listen said tarzan easing up a trifle but not releasing his hold
i am tarzan king of the apes mighty hunter mighty fighter
in all the jungle there is none so great
you have said  'kagoda' to me
all the tribe have heard
quarrel no more with your king or your people for next time i shall kill you
do you understand
huh assented terkoz
and you are satisfied
huh said the ape
tarzan let him up and in a few minutes all were back at their vocations as though naught had occurred to mar the tranquility of their primeval forest haunts
but deep in the minds of the apes was rooted the conviction that tarzan was a mighty fighter and a strange creature
strange because he had had it in his power to kill his enemy but had allowed him to liveunharmed
that afternoon as the tribe came together as was their wont before darkness settled on the jungle tarzan his wounds washed in the waters of the stream called the old males about him
you have seen again today that tarzan of the apes is the greatest among you he said
huh they replied with one voice tarzan is great
tarzan he continued is not an ape
he is not like his people
his ways are not their ways and so tarzan is going back to the lair of his own kind by the waters of the great lake which has no farther shore
you must choose another to rule you for tarzan will not return
and thus young lord greystoke took the first step toward the goal which he had setthe finding of other white men like himself
chapter xiii  his own kind   the following morning tarzan lame and sore from the wounds of his battle with terkoz set out toward the west and the seacoast
he traveled very slowly sleeping in the jungle at night and reaching his cabin late the following morning
for several days he moved about but little only enough to gather what fruits and nuts he required to satisfy the demands of hunger
in ten days he was quite sound again except for a terrible halfhealed scar which starting above his left eye ran across the top of his head ending at the right ear
it was the mark left by terkoz when he had torn the scalp away
during his convalescence tarzan tried to fashion a mantle from the skin of sabor which had lain all this time in the cabin
but he found the hide had dried as stiff as a board and as he knew naught of tanning he was forced to abandon his cherished plan
then he determined to filch what few garments he could from one of the black men of mbonga's village for tarzan of the apes had decided to mark his evolution from the lower orders in every possible manner and nothing seemed to him a more distinguishing badge of manhood than ornaments and clothing
to this end therefore he collected the various arm and leg ornaments he had taken from the black warriors who had succumbed to his swift and silent noose and donned them all after the way he had seen them worn
about his neck hung the golden chain from which depended the diamond encrusted locket of his mother the lady alice
at his back was a quiver of arrows slung from a leathern shoulder belt another piece of loot from some vanquished black
about his waist was a belt of tiny strips of rawhide fashioned by himself as a support for the homemade scabbard in which hung his father's hunting knife
the long bow which had been kulonga's hung over his left shoulder
the young lord greystoke was indeed a strange and warlike figure his mass of black hair falling to his shoulders behind and cut with his hunting knife to a rude bang upon his forehead that it might not fall before his eyes
his straight and perfect figure muscled as the best of the ancient roman gladiators must have been muscled and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a greek god told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed
a personification was tarzan of the apes of the primitive man the hunter the warrior
with the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad shoulders and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine clear eyes he might readily have typified some demigod of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest
but of these things tarzan did not think
he was worried because he had not clothing to indicate to all the jungle folks that he was a man and not an ape and grave doubt often entered his mind as to whether he might not yet become an ape
was not hair commencing to grow upon his face
all the apes had hair upon theirs but the black men were entirely hairless with very few exceptions
true he had seen pictures in his books of men with great masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin but nevertheless tarzan was afraid
almost daily he whetted his keen knife and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this degrading emblem of apehood
and so he learned to shaverudely and painfully it is truebut nevertheless effectively
when he felt quite strong again after his bloody battle with terkoz tarzan set off one morning towards mbonga's village
he was moving carelessly along a winding jungle trail instead of making his progress through the trees when suddenly he came face to face with a black warrior
the look of surprise on the savage face was almost comical and before tarzan could unsling his bow the fellow had turned and fled down the path crying out in alarm as though to others before him
tarzan took to the trees in pursuit and in a few moments came in view of the men desperately striving to escape
there were three of them and they were racing madly in single file through the dense undergrowth
tarzan easily distanced them nor did they see his silent passage above their heads nor note the crouching figure squatted upon a low branch ahead of them beneath which the trail led them
tarzan let the first two pass beneath him but as the third came swiftly on the quiet noose dropped about the black throat
a quick jerk drew it taut
there was an agonized scream from the victim and his fellows turned to see his struggling body rise as by magic slowly into the dense foliage of the trees above
with frightened shrieks they wheeled once more and plunged on in their efforts to escape
tarzan dispatched his prisoner quickly and silently removed the weapons and ornaments andoh the greatest joy of alla handsome deerskin breechcloth which he quickly transferred to his own person
now indeed was he dressed as a man should be
none there was who could now doubt his high origin
how he should have liked to have returned to the tribe to parade before their envious gaze this wondrous finery
taking the body across his shoulder he moved more slowly through the trees toward the little palisaded village for he again needed arrows
as he approached quite close to the enclosure he saw an excited group surrounding the two fugitives who trembling with fright and exhaustion were scarce able to recount the uncanny details of their adventure
mirando they said who had been ahead of them a short distance had suddenly come screaming toward them crying that a terrible white and naked warrior was pursuing him
the three of them had hurried toward the village as rapidly as their legs would carry them
again mirando's shrill cry of mortal terror had caused them to look back and there they had seen the most horrible sighttheir companion's body flying upwards into the trees his arms and legs beating the air and his tongue protruding from his open mouth
no other sound did he utter nor was there any creature in sight about him
the villagers were worked up into a state of fear bordering on panic but wise old mbonga affected to feel considerable skepticism regarding the tale and attributed the whole fabrication to their fright in the face of some real danger
you tell us this great story he said because you do not dare to speak the truth
you do not dare admit that when the lion sprang upon mirando you ran away and left him
you are cowards
scarcely had mbonga ceased speaking when a great crashing of branches in the trees above them caused the blacks to look up in renewed terror
the sight that met their eyes made even wise old mbonga shudder for there turning and twisting in the air came the dead body of mirando to sprawl with a sickening reverberation upon the ground at their feet
with one accord the blacks took to their heels nor did they stop until the last of them was lost in the dense shadows of the surrounding jungle
again tarzan came down into the village and renewed his supply of arrows and ate of the offering of food which the blacks had made to appease his wrath
before he left he carried the body of mirando to the gate of the village and propped it up against the palisade in such a way that the dead face seemed to be peering around the edge of the gatepost down the path which led to the jungle
then tarzan returned hunting always hunting to the cabin by the beach
it took a dozen attempts on the part of the thoroughly frightened blacks to reenter their village past the horrible grinning face of their dead fellow and when they found the food and arrows gone they knew what they had only too well feared that mirando had seen the evil spirit of the jungle
that now seemed to them the logical explanation
only those who saw this terrible god of the jungle died for was it not true that none left alive in the village had ever seen him
therefore those who had died at his hands must have seen him and paid the penalty with their lives
as long as they supplied him with arrows and food he would not harm them unless they looked upon him so it was ordered by mbonga that in addition to the food offering there should also be laid out an offering of arrows for this munangokeewati and this was done from then on
if you ever chance to pass that far off african village you will still see before a tiny thatched hut built just without the village a little iron pot in which is a quantity of food and beside it a quiver of welldaubed arrows
when tarzan came in sight of the beach where stood his cabin a strange and unusual spectacle met his vision
on the placid waters of the landlocked harbor floated a great ship and on the beach a small boat was drawn up
but most wonderful of all a number of white men like himself were moving about between the beach and his cabin
tarzan saw that in many ways they were like the men of his picture books
he crept closer through the trees until he was quite close above them
there were ten men swarthy suntanned villainous looking fellows
now they had congregated by the boat and were talking in loud angry tones with much gesticulating and shaking of fists
presently one of them a little meanfaced blackbearded fellow with a countenance which reminded tarzan of pamba the rat laid his hand upon the shoulder of a giant who stood next him and with whom all the others had been arguing and quarreling
the little man pointed inland so that the giant was forced to turn away from the others to look in the direction indicated
as he turned the little meanfaced man drew a revolver from his belt and shot the giant in the back
the big fellow threw his hands above his head his knees bent beneath him and without a sound he tumbled forward upon the beach dead
the report of the weapon the first that tarzan had ever heard filled him with wonderment but even this unaccustomed sound could not startle his healthy nerves into even a semblance of panic
the conduct of the white strangers it was that caused him the greatest perturbation
he puckered his brows into a frown of deep thought
it was well thought he that he had not given way to his first impulse to rush forward and greet these white men as brothers
they were evidently no different from the black menno more civilized than the apesno less cruel than sabor
for a moment the others stood looking at the little meanfaced man and the giant lying dead upon the beach
then one of them laughed and slapped the little man upon the back
there was much more talk and gesticulating but less quarreling
presently they launched the boat and all jumped into it and rowed away toward the great ship where tarzan could see other figures moving about upon the deck
when they had clambered aboard tarzan dropped to earth behind a great tree and crept to his cabin keeping it always between himself and the ship
slipping in at the door he found that everything had been ransacked
his books and pencils strewed the floor
his weapons and shields and other little store of treasures were littered about
as he saw what had been done a great wave of anger surged through him and the new made scar upon his forehead stood suddenly out a bar of inflamed crimson against his tawny hide
quickly he ran to the cupboard and searched in the far recess of the lower shelf
ah
he breathed a sigh of relief as he drew out the little tin box and opening it found his greatest treasures undisturbed
the photograph of the smiling strongfaced young man and the little black puzzle book were safe
what was that
his quick ear had caught a faint but unfamiliar sound
running to the window tarzan looked toward the harbor and there he saw that a boat was being lowered from the great ship beside the one already in the water
soon he saw many people clambering over the sides of the larger vessel and dropping into the boats
they were coming back in full force
for a moment longer tarzan watched while a number of boxes and bundles were lowered into the waiting boats then as they shoved off from the ship's side the apeman snatched up a piece of paper and with a pencil printed on it for a few moments until it bore several lines of strong wellmade almost letterperfect characters
this notice he stuck upon the door with a small sharp splinter of wood
then gathering up his precious tin box his arrows and as many bows and spears as he could carry he hastened through the door and disappeared into the forest
when the two boats were beached upon the silvery sand it was a strange assortment of humanity that clambered ashore
some twenty souls in all there were fifteen of them rough and villainous appearing seamen
the others of the party were of different stamp
one was an elderly man with white hair and large rimmed spectacles
his slightly stooped shoulders were draped in an illfitting though immaculate frock coat and a shiny silk hat added to the incongruity of his garb in an african jungle
the second member of the party to land was a tall young man in white ducks while directly behind came another elderly man with a very high forehead and a fussy excitable manner
after these came a huge negress clothed like solomon as to colors
her great eyes rolled in evident terror first toward the jungle and then toward the cursing band of sailors who were removing the bales and boxes from the boats
the last member of the party to disembark was a girl of about nineteen and it was the young man who stood at the boat's prow to lift her high and dry upon land
she gave him a brave and pretty smile of thanks but no words passed between them
in silence the party advanced toward the cabin
it was evident that whatever their intentions all had been decided upon before they left the ship and so they came to the door the sailors carrying the boxes and bales followed by the five who were of so different a class
the men put down their burdens and then one caught sight of the notice which tarzan had posted
ho mates
he cried
what's here
this sign was not posted an hour ago or i'll eat the cook
the others gathered about craning their necks over the shoulders of those before them but as few of them could read at all and then only after the most laborious fashion one finally turned to the little old man of the top hat and frock coat
hi perfesser he called step for'rd and read the bloomin' notis
thus addressed the old man came slowly to where the sailors stood followed by the other members of his party
adjusting his spectacles he looked for a moment at the placard and then turning away strolled off muttering to himself  most remarkablemost remarkable
hi old fossil cried the man who had first called on him for assistance did je think we wanted of you to read the bloomin' notis to yourself
come back here and read it out loud you old barnacle
the old man stopped and turning back said  oh yes my dear sir a thousand pardons
it was quite thoughtless of me yesvery thoughtless
most remarkablemost remarkable
again he faced the notice and read it through and doubtless would have turned off again to ruminate upon it had not the sailor grasped him roughly by the collar and howled into his ear
read it out loud you blithering old idiot
ah yes indeed yes indeed replied the professor softly and adjusting his spectacles once more he read aloud        this is the house of tarzan the   killer of beasts and many black   men
do not harm the things which   are tarzan's
tarzan watches
tarzan of the apes
who the devil is tarzan
cried the sailor who had before spoken
he evidently speaks english said the young man
but what does 'tarzan of the apes' mean
cried the girl
i do not know miss porter replied the young man unless we have discovered a runaway simian from the london zoo who has brought back a european education to his jungle home
what do you make of it professor porter
he added turning to the old man
professor archimedes q porter adjusted his spectacles
ah yes indeed yes indeedmost remarkable most remarkable
said the professor but i can add nothing further to what i have already remarked in elucidation of this truly momentous occurrence and the professor turned slowly in the direction of the jungle
but papa cried the girl you haven't said anything about it yet
tut tut child tut tut responded professor porter in a kindly and indulgent tone do not trouble your pretty head with such weighty and abstruse problems and again he wandered slowly off in still another direction his eyes bent upon the ground at his feet his hands clasped behind him beneath the flowing tails of his coat
i reckon the daffy old bounder don't know no more'n we do about it growled the ratfaced sailor
keep a civil tongue in your head cried the young man his face paling in anger at the insulting tone of the sailor
you've murdered our officers and robbed us
we are absolutely in your power but you'll treat professor porter and miss porter with respect or i'll break that vile neck of yours with my bare handsguns or no guns and the young fellow stepped so close to the ratfaced sailor that the latter though he bore two revolvers and a villainous looking knife in his belt slunk back abashed
you damned coward cried the young man
you'd never dare shoot a man until his back was turned
you don't dare shoot me even then and he deliberately turned his back full upon the sailor and walked nonchalantly away as if to put him to the test
the sailor's hand crept slyly to the butt of one of his revolvers his wicked eyes glared vengefully at the retreating form of the young englishman
the gaze of his fellows was upon him but still he hesitated
at heart he was even a greater coward than mr william cecil clayton had imagined
two keen eyes had watched every move of the party from the foliage of a nearby tree
tarzan had seen the surprise caused by his notice and while he could understand nothing of the spoken language of these strange people their gestures and facial expressions told him much
the act of the little ratfaced sailor in killing one of his comrades had aroused a strong dislike in tarzan and now that he saw him quarreling with the finelooking young man his animosity was still further stirred
tarzan had never seen the effects of a firearm before though his books had taught him something of them but when he saw the ratfaced one fingering the butt of his revolver he thought of the scene he had witnessed so short a time before and naturally expected to see the young man murdered as had been the huge sailor earlier in the day
so tarzan fitted a poisoned arrow to his bow and drew a bead upon the ratfaced sailor but the foliage was so thick that he soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves or some small branch and instead he launched a heavy spear from his lofty perch
clayton had taken but a dozen steps
the ratfaced sailor had half drawn his revolver the other sailors stood watching the scene intently
professor porter had already disappeared into the jungle whither he was being followed by the fussy samuel t philander his secretary and assistant
esmeralda the negress was busy sorting her mistress' baggage from the pile of bales and boxes beside the cabin and miss porter had turned away to follow clayton when something caused her to turn again toward the sailor
and then three things happened almost simultaneously
the sailor jerked out his weapon and leveled it at clayton's back miss porter screamed a warning and a long metalshod spear shot like a bolt from above and passed entirely through the right shoulder of the ratfaced man
the revolver exploded harmlessly in the air and the seaman crumpled up with a scream of pain and terror
clayton turned and rushed back toward the scene
the sailors stood in a frightened group with drawn weapons peering into the jungle
the wounded man writhed and shrieked upon the ground
clayton unseen by any picked up the fallen revolver and slipped it inside his shirt then he joined the sailors in gazing mystified into the jungle
who could it have been
whispered jane porter and the young man turned to see her standing wideeyed and wondering close beside him
i dare say tarzan of the apes is watching us all right he answered in a dubious tone
i wonder now who that spear was intended for
if for snipes then our ape friend is a friend indeed
by jove where are your father and mr philander
there's someone or something in that jungle and it's armed whatever it is
ho
professor
mr
philander
young clayton shouted
there was no response
what's to be done miss porter
continued the young man his face clouded by a frown of worry and indecision
i can't leave you here alone with these cutthroats and you certainly can't venture into the jungle with me yet someone must go in search of your father
he is more than apt to wandering off aimlessly regardless of danger or direction and mr philander is only a trifle less impractical than he
you will pardon my bluntness but our lives are all in jeopardy here and when we get your father back something must be done to impress upon him the dangers to which he exposes you as well as himself by his absentmindedness
i quite agree with you replied the girl and i am not offended at all
dear old papa would sacrifice his life for me without an instant's hesitation provided one could keep his mind on so frivolous a matter for an entire instant
there is only one way to keep him in safety and that is to chain him to a tree
the poor dear is so impractical
i have it
suddenly exclaimed clayton
you can use a revolver can't you
yes
why
i have one
with it you and esmeralda will be comparatively safe in this cabin while i am searching for your father and mr philander
come call the woman and i will hurry on
they can't have gone far
jane did as he suggested and when he saw the door close safely behind them clayton turned toward the jungle
some of the sailors were drawing the spear from their wounded comrade and as clayton approached he asked if he could borrow a revolver from one of them while he searched the jungle for the professor
the ratfaced one finding he was not dead had regained his composure and with a volley of oaths directed at clayton refused in the name of his fellows to allow the young man any firearms
this man snipes had assumed the role of chief since he had killed their former leader and so little time had elapsed that none of his companions had as yet questioned his authority
clayton's only response was a shrug of the shoulders but as he left them he picked up the spear which had transfixed snipes and thus primitively armed the son of the then lord greystoke strode into the dense jungle
every few moments he called aloud the names of the wanderers
the watchers in the cabin by the beach heard the sound of his voice growing ever fainter and fainter until at last it was swallowed up by the myriad noises of the primeval wood
when professor archimedes q porter and his assistant samuel t philander after much insistence on the part of the latter had finally turned their steps toward camp they were as completely lost in the wild and tangled labyrinth of the matted jungle as two human beings well could be though they did not know it
it was by the merest caprice of fortune that they headed toward the west coast of africa instead of toward zanzibar on the opposite side of the dark continent
when in a short time they reached the beach only to find no camp in sight philander was positive that they were north of their proper destination while as a matter of fact they were about two hundred yards south of it
it never occurred to either of these impractical theorists to call aloud on the chance of attracting their friends' attention
instead with all the assurance that deductive reasoning from a wrong premise induces in one mr samuel t philander grasped professor archimedes q porter firmly by the arm and hurried the weakly protesting old gentleman off in the direction of cape town fifteen hundred miles to the south
when jane and esmeralda found themselves safely behind the cabin door the negress's first thought was to barricade the portal from the inside
with this idea in mind she turned to search for some means of putting it into execution but her first view of the interior of the cabin brought a shriek of terror to her lips and like a frightened child the huge woman ran to bury her face on her mistress' shoulder
jane turning at the cry saw the cause of it lying prone upon the floor before themthe whitened skeleton of a man
a further glance revealed a second skeleton upon the bed
what horrible place are we in
murmured the awestruck girl
but there was no panic in her fright
at last disengaging herself from the frantic clutch of the still shrieking esmeralda jane crossed the room to look into the little cradle knowing what she should see there even before the tiny skeleton disclosed itself in all its pitiful and pathetic frailty
what an awful tragedy these poor mute bones proclaimed
the girl shuddered at thought of the eventualities which might lie before herself and her friends in this illfated cabin the haunt of mysterious perhaps hostile beings
quickly with an impatient stamp of her little foot she endeavored to shake off the gloomy forebodings and turning to esmeralda bade her cease her wailing
stop esmeralda stop it this minute
she cried
you are only making it worse
she ended lamely a little quiver in her own voice as she thought of the three men upon whom she depended for protection wandering in the depth of that awful forest
soon the girl found that the door was equipped with a heavy wooden bar upon the inside and after several efforts the combined strength of the two enabled them to slip it into place the first time in twenty years
then they sat down upon a bench with their arms about one another and waited
chapter xiv  at the mercy of the jungle   after clayton had plunged into the jungle the sailorsmutineers of the arrowfell into a discussion of their next step but on one point all were agreedthat they should hasten to put off to the anchored arrow where they could at least be safe from the spears of their unseen foe
and so while jane porter and esmeralda were barricading themselves within the cabin the cowardly crew of cutthroats were pulling rapidly for their ship in the two boats that had brought them ashore
so much had tarzan seen that day that his head was in a whirl of wonder
but the most wonderful sight of all to him was the face of the beautiful white girl
here at last was one of his own kind of that he was positive
and the young man and the two old men they too were much as he had pictured his own people to be
but doubtless they were as ferocious and cruel as other men he had seen
the fact that they alone of all the party were unarmed might account for the fact that they had killed no one
they might be very different if provided with weapons
tarzan had seen the young man pick up the fallen revolver of the wounded snipes and hide it away in his breast and he had also seen him slip it cautiously to the girl as she entered the cabin door
he did not understand anything of the motives behind all that he had seen but somehow intuitively he liked the young man and the two old men and for the girl he had a strange longing which he scarcely understood
as for the big black woman she was evidently connected in some way to the girl and so he liked her also
for the sailors and especially snipes he had developed a great hatred
he knew by their threatening gestures and by the expression upon their evil faces that they were enemies of the others of the party and so he decided to watch closely
tarzan wondered why the men had gone into the jungle nor did it ever occur to him that one could become lost in that maze of undergrowth which to him was as simple as is the main street of your own home town to you
when he saw the sailors row away toward the ship and knew that the girl and her companion were safe in his cabin tarzan decided to follow the young man into the jungle and learn what his errand might be
he swung off rapidly in the direction taken by clayton and in a short time heard faintly in the distance the now only occasional calls of the englishman to his friends
presently tarzan came up with the white man who almost fagged was leaning against a tree wiping the perspiration from his forehead
the apeman hiding safe behind a screen of foliage sat watching this new specimen of his own race intently
at intervals clayton called aloud and finally it came to tarzan that he was searching for the old man
tarzan was on the point of going off to look for them himself when he caught the yellow glint of a sleek hide moving cautiously through the jungle toward clayton
it was sheeta the leopard
now tarzan heard the soft bending of grasses and wondered why the young white man was not warned
could it be he had failed to note the loud warning
never before had tarzan known sheeta to be so clumsy
no the white man did not hear
sheeta was crouching for the spring and then shrill and horrible there rose from the stillness of the jungle the awful cry of the challenging ape and sheeta turned crashing into the underbrush
clayton came to his feet with a start
his blood ran cold
never in all his life had so fearful a sound smote upon his ears
he was no coward but if ever man felt the icy fingers of fear upon his heart william cecil clayton eldest son of lord greystoke of england did that day in the fastness of the african jungle
the noise of some great body crashing through the underbrush so close beside him and the sound of that bloodcurdling shriek from above tested clayton's courage to the limit but he could not know that it was to that very voice he owed his life nor that the creature who hurled it forth was his own cousinthe real lord greystoke
the afternoon was drawing to a close and clayton disheartened and discouraged was in a terrible quandary as to the proper course to pursue whether to keep on in search of professor porter at the almost certain risk of his own death in the jungle by night or to return to the cabin where he might at least serve to protect jane from the perils which confronted her on all sides
he did not wish to return to camp without her father still more he shrank from the thought of leaving her alone and unprotected in the hands of the mutineers of the arrow or to the hundred unknown dangers of the jungle
possibly too he thought the professor and philander might have returned to camp
yes that was more than likely
at least he would return and see before he continued what seemed to be a most fruitless quest
and so he started stumbling back through the thick and matted underbrush in the direction that he thought the cabin lay
to tarzan's surprise the young man was heading further into the jungle in the general direction of mbonga's village and the shrewd young apeman was convinced that he was lost
to tarzan this was scarcely comprehensible his judgment told him that no man would venture toward the village of the cruel blacks armed only with a spear which from the awkward way in which he carried it was evidently an unaccustomed weapon to this white man
nor was he following the trail of the old men
that they had crossed and left long since though it had been fresh and plain before tarzan's eyes
tarzan was perplexed
the fierce jungle would make easy prey of this unprotected stranger in a very short time if he were not guided quickly to the beach
yes there was numa the lion even now stalking the white man a dozen paces to the right
clayton heard the great body paralleling his course and now there rose upon the evening air the beast's thunderous roar
the man stopped with upraised spear and faced the brush from which issued the awful sound
the shadows were deepening darkness was settling in
god
to die here alone beneath the fangs of wild beasts to be torn and rended to feel the hot breath of the brute on his face as the great paw crushed down upon his breast
for a moment all was still
clayton stood rigid with raised spear
presently a faint rustling of the bush apprised him of the stealthy creeping of the thing behind
it was gathering for the spring
at last he saw it not twenty feet awaythe long lithe muscular body and tawny head of a huge blackmaned lion
the beast was upon its belly moving forward very slowly
as its eyes met clayton's it stopped and deliberately cautiously gathered its hind quarters behind it
in agony the man watched fearful to launch his spear powerless to fly
he heard a noise in the tree above him
some new danger he thought but he dared not take his eyes from the yellow green orbs before him
there was a sharp twang as of a broken banjostring and at the same instant an arrow appeared in the yellow hide of the crouching lion
with a roar of pain and anger the beast sprang but somehow clayton stumbled to one side and as he turned again to face the infuriated king of beasts he was appalled at the sight which confronted him
almost simultaneously with the lion's turning to renew the attack a halfnaked giant dropped from the tree above squarely on the brute's back
with lightning speed an arm that was banded layers of iron muscle encircled the huge neck and the great beast was raised from behind roaring and pawing the airraised as easily as clayton would have lifted a pet dog
the scene he witnessed there in the twilight depths of the african jungle was burned forever into the englishman's brain
the man before him was the embodiment of physical perfection and giant strength yet it was not upon these he depended in his battle with the great cat for mighty as were his muscles they were as nothing by comparison with numa's
to his agility to his brain and to his long keen knife he owed his supremacy
his right arm encircled the lion's neck while the left hand plunged the knife time and again into the unprotected side behind the left shoulder
the infuriated beast pulled up and backwards until he stood upon his hind legs struggled impotently in this unnatural position
had the battle been of a few seconds' longer duration the outcome might have been different but it was all accomplished so quickly that the lion had scarce time to recover from the confusion of its surprise ere it sank lifeless to the ground
then the strange figure which had vanquished it stood erect upon the carcass and throwing back the wild and handsome head gave out the fearsome cry which a few moments earlier had so startled clayton
before him he saw the figure of a young man naked except for a loin cloth and a few barbaric ornaments about arms and legs on the breast a priceless diamond locket gleaming against a smooth brown skin
the hunting knife had been returned to its homely sheath and the man was gathering up his bow and quiver from where he had tossed them when he leaped to attack the lion
clayton spoke to the stranger in english thanking him for his brave rescue and complimenting him on the wondrous strength and dexterity he had displayed but the only answer was a steady stare and a faint shrug of the mighty shoulders which might betoken either disparagement of the service rendered or ignorance of clayton's language
when the bow and quiver had been slung to his back the wild man for such clayton now thought him once more drew his knife and deftly carved a dozen large strips of meat from the lion's carcass
then squatting upon his haunches he proceeded to eat first motioning clayton to join him
the strong white teeth sank into the raw and dripping flesh in apparent relish of the meal but clayton could not bring himself to share the uncooked meat with his strange host instead he watched him and presently there dawned upon him the conviction that this was tarzan of the apes whose notice he had seen posted upon the cabin door that morning
if so he must speak english
again clayton attempted speech with the apeman but the replies now vocal were in a strange tongue which resembled the chattering of monkeys mingled with the growling of some wild beast
no this could not be tarzan of the apes for it was very evident that he was an utter stranger to english
when tarzan had completed his repast he rose and pointing a very different direction from that which clayton had been pursuing started off through the jungle toward the point he had indicated
clayton bewildered and confused hesitated to follow him for he thought he was but being led more deeply into the mazes of the forest but the apeman seeing him disinclined to follow returned and grasping him by the coat dragged him along until he was convinced that clayton understood what was required of him
then he left him to follow voluntarily
the englishman finally concluding that he was a prisoner saw no alternative open but to accompany his captor and thus they traveled slowly through the jungle while the sable mantle of the impenetrable forest night fell about them and the stealthy footfalls of padded paws mingled with the breaking of twigs and the wild calls of the savage life that clayton felt closing in upon him
suddenly clayton heard the faint report of a firearma single shot and then silence
in the cabin by the beach two thoroughly terrified women clung to each other as they crouched upon the low bench in the gathering darkness
the negress sobbed hysterically bemoaning the evil day that had witnessed her departure from her dear maryland while the white girl dry eyed and outwardly calm was torn by inward fears and forebodings
she feared not more for herself than for the three men whom she knew to be wandering in the abysmal depths of the savage jungle from which she now heard issuing the almost incessant shrieks and roars barkings and growlings of its terrifying and fearsome denizens as they sought their prey
and now there came the sound of a heavy body brushing against the side of the cabin
she could hear the great padded paws upon the ground outside
for an instant all was silence even the bedlam of the forest died to a faint murmur
then she distinctly heard the beast outside sniffing at the door not two feet from where she crouched
instinctively the girl shuddered and shrank closer to the black woman
hush
she whispered
hush esmeralda for the woman's sobs and groans seemed to have attracted the thing that stalked there just beyond the thin wall
a gentle scratching sound was heard on the door
the brute tried to force an entrance but presently this ceased and again she heard the great pads creeping stealthily around the cabin
again they stoppedbeneath the window on which the terrified eyes of the girl now glued themselves
god
she murmured for now silhouetted against the moonlit sky beyond she saw framed in the tiny square of the latticed window the head of a huge lioness
the gleaming eyes were fixed upon her in intent ferocity
look esmeralda
she whispered
for god's sake what shall we do
look
quick
the window
esmeralda cowering still closer to her mistress took one frightened glance toward the little square of moonlight just as the lioness emitted a low savage snarl
the sight that met the poor woman's eyes was too much for the already overstrung nerves
oh gaberelle
she shrieked and slid to the floor an inert and senseless mass
for what seemed an eternity the great brute stood with its forepaws upon the sill glaring into the little room
presently it tried the strength of the lattice with its great talons
the girl had almost ceased to breathe when to her relief the head disappeared and she heard the brute's footsteps leaving the window
but now they came to the door again and once more the scratching commenced this time with increasing force until the great beast was tearing at the massive panels in a perfect frenzy of eagerness to seize its defenseless victims
could jane have known the immense strength of that door built piece by piece she would have felt less fear of the lioness reaching her by this avenue
little did john clayton imagine when he fashioned that crude but mighty portal that one day twenty years later it would shield a fair american girl then unborn from the teeth and talons of a maneater
for fully twenty minutes the brute alternately sniffed and tore at the door occasionally giving voice to a wild savage cry of baffled rage
at length however she gave up the attempt and jane heard her returning toward the window beneath which she paused for an instant and then launched her great weight against the timeworn lattice
the girl heard the wooden rods groan beneath the impact but they held and the huge body dropped back to the ground below
again and again the lioness repeated these tactics until finally the horrified prisoner within saw a portion of the lattice give way and in an instant one great paw and the head of the animal were thrust within the room
slowly the powerful neck and shoulders spread the bars apart and the lithe body protruded farther and farther into the room
as in a trance the girl rose her hand upon her breast wide eyes staring horrorstricken into the snarling face of the beast scarce ten feet from her
at her feet lay the prostrate form of the negress
if she could but arouse her their combined efforts might possibly avail to beat back the fierce and bloodthirsty intruder
jane stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder
roughly she shook her
esmeralda
esmeralda
she cried
help me or we are lost
esmeralda opened her eyes
the first object they encountered was the dripping fangs of the hungry lioness
with a horrified scream the poor woman rose to her hands and knees and in this position scurried across the room shrieking o gaberelle
o gaberelle
at the top of her lungs
esmeralda weighed some two hundred and eighty pounds and her extreme haste added to her extreme corpulency produced a most amazing result when esmeralda elected to travel on all fours
for a moment the lioness remained quiet with intense gaze directed upon the flitting esmeralda whose goal appeared to be the cupboard into which she attempted to propel her huge bulk but as the shelves were but nine or ten inches apart she only succeeded in getting her head in whereupon with a final screech which paled the jungle noises into insignificance she fainted once again
with the subsidence of esmeralda the lioness renewed her efforts to wriggle her huge bulk through the weakening lattice
the girl standing pale and rigid against the farther wall sought with everincreasing terror for some loophole of escape
suddenly her hand tightpressed against her bosom felt the hard outline of the revolver that clayton had left with her earlier in the day
quickly she snatched it from its hidingplace and leveling it full at the lioness's face pulled the trigger
there was a flash of flame the roar of the discharge and an answering roar of pain and anger from the beast
jane porter saw the great form disappear from the window and then she too fainted the revolver falling at her side
but sabor was not killed
the bullet had but inflicted a painful wound in one of the great shoulders
it was the surprise at the blinding flash and the deafening roar that had caused her hasty but temporary retreat
in another instant she was back at the lattice and with renewed fury was clawing at the aperture but with lessened effect since the wounded member was almost useless
she saw her preythe two womenlying senseless upon the floor
there was no longer any resistance to be overcome
her meat lay before her and sabor had only to worm her way through the lattice to claim it
slowly she forced her great bulk inch by inch through the opening
now her head was through now one great forearm and shoulder
carefully she drew up the wounded member to insinuate it gently beyond the tight pressing bars
a moment more and both shoulders through the long sinuous body and the narrow hips would glide quickly after
it was on this sight that jane porter again opened her eyes
chapter xv  the forest god   when clayton heard the report of the firearm he fell into an agony of fear and apprehension
he knew that one of the sailors might be the author of it but the fact that he had left the revolver with jane together with the overwrought condition of his nerves made him morbidly positive that she was threatened with some great danger
perhaps even now she was attempting to defend herself against some savage man or beast
what were the thoughts of his strange captor or guide clayton could only vaguely conjecture but that he had heard the shot and was in some manner affected by it was quite evident for he quickened his pace so appreciably that clayton stumbling blindly in his wake was down a dozen times in as many minutes in a vain effort to keep pace with him and soon was left hopelessly behind
fearing that he would again be irretrievably lost he called aloud to the wild man ahead of him and in a moment had the satisfaction of seeing him drop lightly to his side from the branches above
for a moment tarzan looked at the young man closely as though undecided as to just what was best to do then stooping down before clayton he motioned him to grasp him about the neck and with the white man upon his back tarzan took to the trees
the next few minutes the young englishman never forgot
high into bending and swaying branches he was borne with what seemed to him incredible swiftness while tarzan chafed at the slowness of his progress
from one lofty branch the agile creature swung with clayton through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree then for a hundred yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths of verdure beneath
from the first sensation of chilling fear clayton passed to one of keen admiration and envy of those giant muscles and that wondrous instinct or knowledge which guided this forest god through the inky blackness of the night as easily and safely as clayton would have strolled a london street at high noon
occasionally they would enter a spot where the foliage above was less dense and the bright rays of the moon lit up before clayton's wondering eyes the strange path they were traversing
at such times the man fairly caught his breath at sight of the horrid depths below them for tarzan took the easiest way which often led over a hundred feet above the earth
and yet with all his seeming speed tarzan was in reality feeling his way with comparative slowness searching constantly for limbs of adequate strength for the maintenance of this double weight
presently they came to the clearing before the beach
tarzan's quick ears had heard the strange sounds of sabor's efforts to force her way through the lattice and it seemed to clayton that they dropped a straight hundred feet to earth so quickly did tarzan descend
yet when they struck the ground it was with scarce a jar and as clayton released his hold on the apeman he saw him dart like a squirrel for the opposite side of the cabin
the englishman sprang quickly after him just in time to see the hind quarters of some huge animal about to disappear through the window of the cabin
as jane opened her eyes to a realization of the imminent peril which threatened her her brave young heart gave up at last its final vestige of hope
but then to her surprise she saw the huge animal being slowly drawn back through the window and in the moonlight beyond she saw the heads and shoulders of two men
as clayton rounded the corner of the cabin to behold the animal disappearing within it was also to see the apeman seize the long tail in both hands and bracing himself with his feet against the side of the cabin throw all his mighty strength into the effort to draw the beast out of the interior
clayton was quick to lend a hand but the apeman jabbered to him in a commanding and peremptory tone something which clayton knew to be orders though he could not understand them
at last under their combined efforts the great body was slowly dragged farther and farther outside the window and then there came to clayton's mind a dawning conception of the rash bravery of his companion's act
for a naked man to drag a shrieking clawing maneater forth from a window by the tail to save a strange white girl was indeed the last word in heroism
insofar as clayton was concerned it was a very different matter since the girl was not only of his own kind and race but was the one woman in all the world whom he loved
though he knew that the lioness would make short work of both of them he pulled with a will to keep it from jane porter
and then he recalled the battle between this man and the great blackmaned lion which he had witnessed a short time before and he commenced to feel more assurance
tarzan was still issuing orders which clayton could not understand
he was trying to tell the stupid white man to plunge his poisoned arrows into sabor's back and sides and to reach the savage heart with the long thin hunting knife that hung at tarzan's hip but the man would not understand and tarzan did not dare release his hold to do the things himself for he knew that the puny white man never could hold mighty sabor alone for an instant
slowly the lioness was emerging from the window
at last her shoulders were out
and then clayton saw an incredible thing
tarzan racking his brains for some means to cope singlehanded with the infuriated beast had suddenly recalled his battle with terkoz and as the great shoulders came clear of the window so that the lioness hung upon the sill only by her forepaws tarzan suddenly released his hold upon the brute
with the quickness of a striking rattler he launched himself full upon sabor's back his strong young arms seeking and gaining a fullnelson upon the beast as he had learned it that other day during his bloody wrestling victory over terkoz
with a roar the lioness turned completely over upon her back falling full upon her enemy but the blackhaired giant only closed tighter his hold
pawing and tearing at earth and air sabor rolled and threw herself this way and that in an effort to dislodge this strange antagonist but ever tighter and tighter drew the iron bands that were forcing her head lower and lower upon her tawny breast
higher crept the steel forearms of the apeman about the back of sabor's neck
weaker and weaker became the lioness's efforts
at last clayton saw the immense muscles of tarzan's shoulders and biceps leap into corded knots beneath the silver moonlight
there was a long sustained and supreme effort on the apeman's partand the vertebrae of sabor's neck parted with a sharp snap
in an instant tarzan was upon his feet and for the second time that day clayton heard the bull ape's savage roar of victory
then he heard jane's agonized cry  cecilmr clayton
oh what is it
what is it
running quickly to the cabin door clayton called out that all was right and shouted to her to open the door
as quickly as she could she raised the great bar and fairly dragged clayton within
what was that awful noise
she whispered shrinking close to him
it was the cry of the kill from the throat of the man who has just saved your life miss porter
wait i will fetch him so you may thank him
the frightened girl would not be left alone so she accompanied clayton to the side of the cabin where lay the dead body of the lioness
tarzan of the apes was gone
clayton called several times but there was no reply and so the two returned to the greater safety of the interior
what a frightful sound
cried jane i shudder at the mere thought of it
do not tell me that a human throat voiced that hideous and fearsome shriek
but it did miss porter replied clayton or at least if not a human throat that of a forest god
and then he told her of his experiences with this strange creatureof how twice the wild man had saved his lifeof the wondrous strength and agility and braveryof the brown skin and the handsome face
i cannot make it out at all he concluded
at first i thought he might be tarzan of the apes but he neither speaks nor understands english so that theory is untenable
well whatever he may be cried the girl we owe him our lives and may god bless him and keep him in safety in his wild and savage jungle
amen said clayton fervently
for the good lord's sake ain't i dead
the two turned to see esmeralda sitting upright upon the floor her great eyes rolling from side to side as though she could not believe their testimony as to her whereabouts
and now for jane porter the reaction came and she threw herself upon the bench sobbing with hysterical laughter
chapter xvi  most remarkable   several miles south of the cabin upon a strip of sandy beach stood two old men arguing
before them stretched the broad atlantic
at their backs was the dark continent
close around them loomed the impenetrable blackness of the jungle
savage beasts roared and growled noises hideous and weird assailed their ears
they had wandered for miles in search of their camp but always in the wrong direction
they were as hopelessly lost as though they suddenly had been transported to another world
at such a time indeed every fiber of their combined intellects must have been concentrated upon the vital question of the minutethe lifeanddeath question to them of retracing their steps to camp
samuel t philander was speaking
but my dear professor he was saying i still maintain that but for the victories of ferdinand and isabella over the fifteenthcentury moors in spain the world would be today a thousand years in advance of where we now find ourselves
the moors were essentially a tolerant broadminded liberal race of agriculturists artisans and merchantsthe very type of people that has made possible such civilization as we find today in america and europewhile the spaniards  tut tut dear mr philander interrupted professor porter their religion positively precluded the possibilities you suggest
moslemism was is and always will be a blight on that scientific progress which has marked  bless me
professor interjected mr philander who had turned his gaze toward the jungle there seems to be someone approaching
professor archimedes q porter turned in the direction indicated by the nearsighted mr philander
tut tut mr philander he chided
how often must i urge you to seek that absolute concentration of your mental faculties which alone may permit you to bring to bear the highest powers of intellectuality upon the momentous problems which naturally fall to the lot of great minds
and now i find you guilty of a most flagrant breach of courtesy in interrupting my learned discourse to call attention to a mere quadruped of the genus felis
as i was saying mr  heavens professor a lion
cried mr philander straining his weak eyes toward the dim figure outlined against the dark tropical underbrush
yes yes mr philander if you insist upon employing slang in your discourse a 'lion'
but as i was saying  bless me professor again interrupted mr philander permit me to suggest that doubtless the moors who were conquered in the fifteenth century will continue in that most regrettable condition for the time being at least even though we postpone discussion of that world calamity until we may attain the enchanting view of yon felis carnivora which distance proverbially is credited with lending
in the meantime the lion had approached with quiet dignity to within ten paces of the two men where he stood curiously watching them
the moonlight flooded the beach and the strange group stood out in bold relief against the yellow sand
most reprehensible most reprehensible exclaimed professor porter with a faint trace of irritation in his voice
never mr philander never before in my life have i known one of these animals to be permitted to roam at large from its cage
i shall most certainly report this outrageous breach of ethics to the directors of the adjacent zoological garden
quite right professor agreed mr philander and the sooner it is done the better
let us start now
seizing the professor by the arm mr philander set off in the direction that would put the greatest distance between themselves and the lion
they had proceeded but a short distance when a backward glance revealed to the horrified gaze of mr philander that the lion was following them
he tightened his grip upon the protesting professor and increased his speed
as i was saying mr philander repeated professor porter
mr philander took another hasty glance rearward
the lion also had quickened his gait and was doggedly maintaining an unvarying distance behind them
he is following us
gasped mr philander breaking into a run
tut tut mr philander remonstrated the professor this unseemly haste is most unbecoming to men of letters
what will our friends think of us who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics
pray let us proceed with more decorum
mr philander stole another observation astern
the lion was bounding along in easy leaps scarce five paces behind
mr philander dropped the professor's arm and broke into a mad orgy of speed that would have done credit to any varsity track team
as i was saying mr philander screamed professor porter as metaphorically speaking he himself threw her into high
he too had caught a fleeting backward glimpse of cruel yellow eyes and half open mouth within startling proximity of his person
with streaming coat tails and shiny silk hat professor archimedes q porter fled through the moonlight close upon the heels of mr samuel t philander
before them a point of the jungle ran out toward a narrow promontory and it was for the haven of the trees he saw there that mr samuel t philander directed his prodigious leaps and bounds while from the shadows of this same spot peered two keen eyes in interested appreciation of the race
it was tarzan of the apes who watched with face agrin this odd game of followtheleader
he knew the two men were safe enough from attack in so far as the lion was concerned
the very fact that numa had foregone such easy prey at all convinced the wise forest craft of tarzan that numa's belly already was full
the lion might stalk them until hungry again but the chances were that if not angered he would soon tire of the sport and slink away to his jungle lair
really the one great danger was that one of the men might stumble and fall and then the yellow devil would be upon him in a moment and the joy of the kill would be too great a temptation to withstand
so tarzan swung quickly to a lower limb in line with the approaching fugitives and as mr samuel t philander came panting and blowing beneath him already too spent to struggle up to the safety of the limb tarzan reached down and grasping him by the collar of his coat yanked him to the limb by his side
another moment brought the professor within the sphere of the friendly grip and he too was drawn upward to safety just as the baffled numa with a roar leaped to recover his vanishing quarry
for a moment the two men clung panting to the great branch while tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of the tree watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement
it was the professor who first broke the silence
i am deeply pained mr philander that you should have evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of one of the lower orders and by your crass timidity have caused me to exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in order that i might resume my discourse
as i was saying mr philander when you interrupted me the moors  professor archimedes q porter broke in mr philander in icy tones the time has arrived when patience becomes a crime and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue
you have accused me of cowardice
you have insinuated that you ran only to overtake me not to escape the clutches of the lion
have a care professor archimedes q porter
i am a desperate man
goaded by longsuffering patience the worm will turn
tut tut mr philander tut tut
cautioned professor porter you forget yourself
i forget nothing as yet professor archimedes q porter but believe me sir i am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness as to your exalted position in the world of science and your gray hairs
the professor sat in silence for a few minutes and the darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled countenance
presently he spoke
look here skinny philander he said in belligerent tones if you are lookin' for a scrap peel off your coat and come on down on the ground and i'll punch your head just as i did sixty years ago in the alley back of porky evans' barn
ark
gasped the astonished mr philander
lordy how good that sounds
when you're human ark i love you but somehow it seems as though you had forgotten how to be human for the last twenty years
the professor reached out a thin trembling old hand through the darkness until it found his old friend's shoulder
forgive me skinny he said softly
it hasn't been quite twenty years and god alone knows how hard i have tried to be 'human' for jane's sake and yours too since he took my other jane away
another old hand stole up from mr philander's side to clasp the one that lay upon his shoulder and no other message could better have translated the one heart to the other
they did not speak for some minutes
the lion below them paced nervously back and forth
the third figure in the tree was hidden by the dense shadows near the stem
he too was silentmotionless as a graven image
you certainly pulled me up into this tree just in time said the professor at last
i want to thank you
you saved my life
but i didn't pull you up here professor said mr philander
bless me
the excitement of the moment quite caused me to forget that i myself was drawn up here by some outside agencythere must be someone or something in this tree with us
eh
ejaculated professor porter
are you quite positive mr
philander
most positive professor replied mr philander and he added i think we should thank the party
he may be sitting right next to you now professor
eh
what's that
tut tut mr philander tut tut
said professor porter edging cautiously nearer to mr philander
just then it occurred to tarzan of the apes that numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time so he raised his young head toward the heavens and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid
the two friends huddled trembling in their precarious position on the limb saw the great lion halt in his restless pacing as the bloodcurdling cry smote his ears and then slink quickly into the jungle to be instantly lost to view
even the lion trembles in fear whispered mr philander
most remarkable most remarkable murmured professor porter clutching frantically at mr philander to regain the balance which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered
unfortunately for them both mr philander's center of equilibrium was at that very moment hanging upon the ragged edge of nothing so that it needed but the gentle impetus supplied by the additional weight of professor porter's body to topple the devoted secretary from the limb
for a moment they swayed uncertainly and then with mingled and most unscholarly shrieks they pitched headlong from the tree locked in frenzied embrace
it was quite some moments ere either moved for both were positive that any such attempt would reveal so many breaks and fractures as to make further progress impossible
at length professor porter made an attempt to move one leg
to his surprise it responded to his will as in days gone by
he now drew up its mate and stretched it forth again
most remarkable most remarkable he murmured
thank god professor whispered mr philander fervently you are not dead then
tut tut mr philander tut tut cautioned professor porter i do not know with accuracy as yet
with infinite solicitude professor porter wiggled his right armjoy
it was intact
breathlessly he waved his left arm above his prostrate bodyit waved
most remarkable most remarkable he said
to whom are you signaling professor
asked mr philander in an excited tone
professor porter deigned to make no response to this puerile inquiry
instead he raised his head gently from the ground nodding it back and forth a half dozen times
most remarkable he breathed
it remains intact
mr philander had not moved from where he had fallen he had not dared the attempt
how indeed could one move when one's arms and legs and back were broken
one eye was buried in the soft loam the other rolling sidewise was fixed in awe upon the strange gyrations of professor porter
how sad
exclaimed mr philander half aloud
concussion of the brain superinducing total mental aberration
how very sad indeed
and for one still so young
professor porter rolled over upon his stomach gingerly he bowed his back until he resembled a huge tom cat in proximity to a yelping dog
then he sat up and felt of various portions of his anatomy
they are all here he exclaimed
most remarkable
whereupon he arose and bending a scathing glance upon the still prostrate form of mr samuel t philander he said  tut tut mr philander this is no time to indulge in slothful ease
we must be up and doing
mr philander lifted his other eye out of the mud and gazed in speechless rage at professor porter
then he attempted to rise nor could there have been any more surprised than he when his efforts were immediately crowned with marked success
he was still bursting with rage however at the cruel injustice of professor porter's insinuation and was on the point of rendering a tart rejoinder when his eyes fell upon a strange figure standing a few paces away scrutinizing them intently
professor porter had recovered his shiny silk hat which he had brushed carefully upon the sleeve of his coat and replaced upon his head
when he saw mr philander pointing to something behind him he turned to behold a giant naked but for a loin cloth and a few metal ornaments standing motionless before him
good evening sir
said the professor lifting his hat
for reply the giant motioned them to follow him and set off up the beach in the direction from which they had recently come
i think it the better part of discretion to follow him said mr philander
tut tut mr philander returned the professor
a short time since you were advancing a most logical argument in substantiation of your theory that camp lay directly south of us
i was skeptical but you finally convinced me so now i am positive that toward the south we must travel to reach our friends
therefore i shall continue south
but professor porter this man may know better than either of us
he seems to be indigenous to this part of the world
let us at least follow him for a short distance
tut tut mr philander repeated the professor
i am a difficult man to convince but when once convinced my decision is unalterable
i shall continue in the proper direction if i have to circumambulate the continent of africa to reach my destination
further argument was interrupted by tarzan who seeing that these strange men were not following him had returned to their side
again he beckoned to them but still they stood in argument
presently the apeman lost patience with their stupid ignorance
he grasped the frightened mr philander by the shoulder and before that worthy gentleman knew whether he was being killed or merely maimed for life tarzan had tied one end of his rope securely about mr philander's neck
tut tut mr philander remonstrated professor porter it is most unbeseeming in you to submit to such indignities
but scarcely were the words out of his mouth ere he too had been seized and securely bound by the neck with the same rope
then tarzan set off toward the north leading the now thoroughly frightened professor and his secretary
in deathly silence they proceeded for what seemed hours to the two tired and hopeless old men but presently as they topped a little rise of ground they were overjoyed to see the cabin lying before them not a hundred yards distant
here tarzan released them and pointing toward the little building vanished into the jungle beside them
most remarkable most remarkable
gasped the professor
but you see mr philander that i was quite right as usual and but for your stubborn willfulness we should have escaped a series of most humiliating not to say dangerous accidents
pray allow yourself to be guided by a more mature and practical mind hereafter when in need of wise counsel
mr samuel t philander was too much relieved at the happy outcome to their adventure to take umbrage at the professor's cruel fling
instead he grasped his friend's arm and hastened him forward in the direction of the cabin
it was a muchrelieved party of castaways that found itself once more united
dawn discovered them still recounting their various adventures and speculating upon the identity of the strange guardian and protector they had found on this savage shore
esmeralda was positive that it was none other than an angel of the lord sent down especially to watch over them
had you seen him devour the raw meat of the lion esmeralda laughed clayton you would have thought him a very material angel
there was nothing heavenly about his voice said jane porter with a little shudder at recollection of the awful roar which had followed the killing of the lioness
nor did it precisely comport with my preconceived ideas of the dignity of divine messengers remarked professor porter when theahgentleman tied two highly respectable and erudite scholars neck to neck and dragged them through the jungle as though they had been cows
chapter xvii  burials   as it was now quite light the party none of whom had eaten or slept since the previous morning began to bestir themselves to prepare food
the mutineers of the arrow had landed a small supply of dried meats canned soups and vegetables crackers flour tea and coffee for the five they had marooned and these were hurriedly drawn upon to satisfy the craving of longfamished appetites
the next task was to make the cabin habitable and to this end it was decided to at once remove the gruesome relics of the tragedy which had taken place there on some bygone day
professor porter and mr philander were deeply interested in examining the skeletons
the two larger they stated had belonged to a male and female of one of the higher white races
the smallest skeleton was given but passing attention as its location in the crib left no doubt as to its having been the infant offspring of this unhappy couple
as they were preparing the skeleton of the man for burial clayton discovered a massive ring which had evidently encircled the man's finger at the time of his death for one of the slender bones of the hand still lay within the golden bauble
picking it up to examine it clayton gave a cry of astonishment for the ring bore the crest of the house of greystoke
at the same time jane discovered the books in the cupboard and on opening the flyleaf of one of them saw the name john clayton london
in a second book which she hurriedly examined was the single name greystoke
why mr clayton she cried what does this mean
here are the names of some of your own people in these books
and here he replied gravely is the great ring of the house of greystoke which has been lost since my uncle john clayton the former lord greystoke disappeared presumably lost at sea
but how do you account for these things being here in this savage african jungle
exclaimed the girl
there is but one way to account for it miss porter said clayton
the late lord greystoke was not drowned
he died here in this cabin and this poor thing upon the floor is all that is mortal of him
then this must have been lady greystoke said jane reverently indicating the poor mass of bones upon the bed
the beautiful lady alice replied clayton of whose many virtues and remarkable personal charms i often have heard my mother and father speak
poor woman he murmured sadly
with deep reverence and solemnity the bodies of the late lord and lady greystoke were buried beside their little african cabin and between them was placed the tiny skeleton of the baby of kala the ape
as mr philander was placing the frail bones of the infant in a bit of sail cloth he examined the skull minutely
then he called professor porter to his side and the two argued in low tones for several minutes
most remarkable most remarkable said professor porter
bless me said mr philander we must acquaint mr clayton with our discovery at once
tut tut mr philander tut tut
remonstrated professor archimedes q porter
'let the dead past bury its dead'
and so the whitehaired old man repeated the burial service over this strange grave while his four companions stood with bowed and uncovered heads about him
from the trees tarzan of the apes watched the solemn ceremony but most of all he watched the sweet face and graceful figure of jane porter
in his savage untutored breast new emotions were stirring
he could not fathom them
he wondered why he felt so great an interest in these peoplewhy he had gone to such pains to save the three men
but he did not wonder why he had torn sabor from the tender flesh of the strange girl
surely the men were stupid and ridiculous and cowardly
even manu the monkey was more intelligent than they
if these were creatures of his own kind he was doubtful if his past pride in blood was warranted
but the girl ahthat was a different matter
he did not reason here
he knew that she was created to be protected and that he was created to protect her
he wondered why they had dug a great hole in the ground merely to bury dry bones
surely there was no sense in that no one wanted to steal dry bones
had there been meat upon them he could have understood for thus alone might one keep his meat from dango the hyena and the other robbers of the jungle
when the grave had been filled with earth the little party turned back toward the cabin and esmeralda still weeping copiously for the two she had never heard of before today and who had been dead twenty years chanced to glance toward the harbor
instantly her tears ceased
look at them low down white trash out there
she shrilled pointing toward the arrow
theyall's a desecrating us right here on this here perverted island
and sure enough the arrow was being worked toward the open sea slowly through the harbor's entrance
they promised to leave us firearms and ammunition said clayton
the merciless beasts
it is the work of that fellow they call snipes i am sure said jane
king was a scoundrel but he had a little sense of humanity
if they had not killed him i know that he would have seen that we were properly provided for before they left us to our fate
i regret that they did not visit us before sailing said professor porter
i had proposed requesting them to leave the treasure with us as i shall be a ruined man if that is lost
jane looked at her father sadly
never mind dear she said
it wouldn't have done any good because it is solely for the treasure that they killed their officers and landed us upon this awful shore
tut tut child tut tut
replied professor porter
you are a good child but inexperienced in practical matters and professor porter turned and walked slowly away toward the jungle his hands clasped beneath his long coat tails and his eyes bent upon the ground
his daughter watched him with a pathetic smile upon her lips and then turning to mr philander she whispered  please don't let him wander off again as he did yesterday
we depend upon you you know to keep a close watch upon him
he becomes more difficult to handle each day replied mr philander with a sigh and a shake of his head
i presume he is now off to report to the directors of the zoo that one of their lions was at large last night
oh miss jane you don't know what i have to contend with
yes i do mr philander but while we all love him you alone are best fitted to manage him for regardless of what he may say to you he respects your great learning and therefore has immense confidence in your judgment
the poor dear cannot differentiate between erudition and wisdom
mr philander with a mildly puzzled expression on his face turned to pursue professor porter and in his mind he was revolving the question of whether he should feel complimented or aggrieved at miss porter's rather backhanded compliment
tarzan had seen the consternation depicted upon the faces of the little group as they witnessed the departure of the arrow so as the ship was a wonderful novelty to him in addition he determined to hasten out to the point of land at the north of the harbor's mouth and obtain a nearer view of the boat as well as to learn if possible the direction of its flight
swinging through the trees with great speed he reached the point only a moment after the ship had passed out of the harbor so that he obtained an excellent view of the wonders of this strange floating house
there were some twenty men running hither and thither about the deck pulling and hauling on ropes
a light land breeze was blowing and the ship had been worked through the harbor's mouth under scant sail but now that they had cleared the point every available shred of canvas was being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible
tarzan watched the graceful movements of the ship in rapt admiration and longed to be aboard her
presently his keen eyes caught the faintest suspicion of smoke on the far northern horizon and he wondered over the cause of such a thing out on the great water
about the same time the lookout on the arrow must have discerned it for in a few minutes tarzan saw the sails being shifted and shortened
the ship came about and presently he knew that she was beating back toward land
a man at the bows was constantly heaving into the sea a rope to the end of which a small object was fastened
tarzan wondered what the purpose of this action might be
at last the ship came up directly into the wind the anchor was lowered down came the sails
there was great scurrying about on deck
a boat was lowered and in it a great chest was placed
then a dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly toward the point where tarzan crouched in the branches of a tree
in the stern of the boat as it drew nearer tarzan saw the ratfaced man
it was but a few minutes later that the boat touched the beach
the men jumped out and lifted the great chest to the sand
they were on the north side of the point so that their presence was concealed from those at the cabin
the men argued angrily for a moment
then the ratfaced one with several companions ascended the low bluff on which stood the tree that concealed tarzan
they looked about for several minutes
here is a good place said the ratfaced sailor indicating a spot beneath tarzan's tree
it is as good as any replied one of his companions
if they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be confiscated anyway
we might as well bury it here on the chance that some of us will escape the gallows to come back and enjoy it later
the ratfaced one now called to the men who had remained at the boat and they came slowly up the bank carrying picks and shovels
hurry you
cried snipes
stow it
retorted one of the men in a surly tone
you're no admiral you damned shrimp
i'm cap'n here though i'll have you to understand you swab shrieked snipes with a volley of frightful oaths
steady boys cautioned one of the men who had not spoken before
it ain't goin' to get us nothing by fightin' amongst ourselves
right enough replied the sailor who had resented snipes' autocratic tones but it ain't agoin' to get nobody nothin' to put on airs in this bloomin' company neither
you fellows dig here said snipes indicating a spot beneath the tree
and while you're diggin' peter kin be amakin' of a map of the location so's we kin find it again
you tom and bill take a couple more down and fetch up the chest
wot are you agoin' to do
asked he of the previous altercation
just boss
git busy there growled snipes
you didn't think your cap'n was agoin' to dig with a shovel did you
the men all looked up angrily
none of them liked snipes and this disagreeable show of authority since he had murdered king the real head and ringleader of the mutineers had only added fuel to the flames of their hatred
do you mean to say that you don't intend to take a shovel and lend a hand with this work
your shoulder's not hurt so allfired bad as that said tarrant the sailor who had before spoken
not by a damned sight replied snipes fingering the butt of his revolver nervously
then by god replied tarrant if you won't take a shovel you'll take a pickax
with the words he raised his pick above his head and with a mighty blow he buried the point in snipes' brain
for a moment the men stood silently looking at the result of their fellow's grim humor
then one of them spoke
served the skunk jolly well right he said
one of the others commenced to ply his pick to the ground
the soil was soft and he threw aside the pick and grasped a shovel then the others joined him
there was no further comment on the killing but the men worked in a better frame of mind than they had since snipes had assumed command
when they had a trench of ample size to bury the chest tarrant suggested that they enlarge it and inter snipes' body on top of the chest
it might 'elp fool any as 'appened to be diggin' 'ereabouts he explained
the others saw the cunning of the suggestion and so the trench was lengthened to accommodate the corpse and in the center a deeper hole was excavated for the box which was first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place which brought its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave
earth was shovelled in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform
two of the men rolled the ratfaced corpse unceremoniously into the grave after first stripping it of its weapons and various other articles which the several members of the party coveted for their own
they then filled the grave with earth and tramped upon it until it would hold no more
the balance of the loose earth was thrown far and wide and a mass of dead undergrowth spread in as natural a manner as possible over the newmade grave to obliterate all signs of the ground having been disturbed
their work done the sailors returned to the small boat and pulled off rapidly toward the arrow
the breeze had increased considerably and as the smoke upon the horizon was now plainly discernible in considerable volume the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail and bearing away toward the southwest
tarzan an interested spectator of all that had taken place sat speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar creatures
men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle
how fortunate was he who lived in the peace and security of the great forest
tarzan wondered what the chest they had buried contained
if they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the water
that would have been much easier
ah he thought but they do want it
they have hidden it here because they intend returning for it later
tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced to examine the earth about the excavation
he was looking to see if these creatures had dropped anything which he might like to own
soon he discovered a spade hidden by the underbrush which they had laid upon the grave
he seized it and attempted to use it as he had seen the sailors do
it was awkward work and hurt his bare feet but he persevered until he had partially uncovered the body
this he dragged from the grave and laid to one side
then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest
this also he dragged to the side of the corpse
then he filled in the smaller hole below the grave replaced the body and the earth around and above it covered it over with underbrush and returned to the chest
four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its weighttarzan of the apes picked it up as though it had been an empty packing case and with the spade slung to his back by a piece of rope carried it off into the densest part of the jungle
he could not well negotiate the trees with his awkward burden but he kept to the trails and so made fairly good time
for several hours he traveled a little north of east until he came to an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation
then he took to the lower branches and in another fifteen minutes he emerged into the amphitheater of the apes where they met in council or to celebrate the rites of the dumdum
near the center of the clearing and not far from the drum or altar he commenced to dig
this was harder work than turning up the freshly excavated earth at the grave but tarzan of the apes was persevering and so he kept at his labor until he was rewarded by seeing a hole sufficiently deep to receive the chest and effectually hide it from view
why had he gone to all this labor without knowing the value of the contents of the chest
tarzan of the apes had a man's figure and a man's brain but he was an ape by training and environment
his brain told him that the chest contained something valuable or the men would not have hidden it
his training had taught him to imitate whatever was new and unusual and now the natural curiosity which is as common to men as to apes prompted him to open the chest and examine its contents
but the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his cunning and his immense strength so that he was compelled to bury the chest without having his curiosity satisfied
by the time tarzan had hunted his way back to the vicinity of the cabin feeding as he went it was quite dark
within the little building a light was burning for clayton had found an unopened tin of oil which had stood intact for twenty years a part of the supplies left with the claytons by black michael
the lamps also were still useable and thus the interior of the cabin appeared as bright as day to the astonished tarzan
he had often wondered at the exact purpose of the lamps
his reading and the pictures had told him what they were but he had no idea of how they could be made to produce the wondrous sunlight that some of his pictures had portrayed them as diffusing upon all surrounding objects
as he approached the window nearest the door he saw that the cabin had been divided into two rooms by a rough partition of boughs and sailcloth
in the front room were the three men the two older deep in argument while the younger tilted back against the wall on an improvised stool was deeply engrossed in reading one of tarzan's books
tarzan was not particularly interested in the men however so he sought the other window
there was the girl
how beautiful her features
how delicate her snowy skin
she was writing at tarzan's own table beneath the window
upon a pile of grasses at the far side of the room lay the negress asleep
for an hour tarzan feasted his eyes upon her while she wrote
how he longed to speak to her but he dared not attempt it for he was convinced that like the young man she would not understand him and he feared too that he might frighten her away
at length she arose leaving her manuscript upon the table
she went to the bed upon which had been spread several layers of soft grasses
these she rearranged
then she loosened the soft mass of golden hair which crowned her head
like a shimmering waterfall turned to burnished metal by a dying sun it fell about her oval face in waving lines below her waist it tumbled
tarzan was spellbound
then she extinguished the lamp and all within the cabin was wrapped in cimmerian darkness
still tarzan watched
creeping close beneath the window he waited listening for half an hour
at last he was rewarded by the sounds of the regular breathing within which denotes sleep
cautiously he intruded his hand between the meshes of the lattice until his whole arm was within the cabin
carefully he felt upon the desk
at last he grasped the manuscript upon which jane porter had been writing and as cautiously withdrew his arm and hand holding the precious treasure
tarzan folded the sheets into a small parcel which he tucked into the quiver with his arrows
then he melted away into the jungle as softly and as noiselessly as a shadow
chapter xviii  the jungle toll   early the following morning tarzan awoke and his first thought of the new day as the last of yesterday was of the wonderful writing which lay hidden in his quiver
hurriedly he brought it forth hoping against hope that he could read what the beautiful white girl had written there the preceding evening
at the first glance he suffered a bitter disappointment never before had he so yearned for anything as now he did for the ability to interpret a message from that goldenhaired divinity who had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly into his life
what did it matter if the message were not intended for him
it was an expression of her thoughts and that was sufficient for tarzan of the apes
and now to be baffled by strange uncouth characters the like of which he had never seen before
why they even tipped in the opposite direction from all that he had ever examined either in printed books or the difficult script of the few letters he had found
even the little bugs of the black book were familiar friends though their arrangement meant nothing to him but these bugs were new and unheard of
for twenty minutes he pored over them when suddenly they commenced to take familiar though distorted shapes
ah they were his old friends but badly crippled
then he began to make out a word here and a word there
his heart leaped for joy
he could read it and he would
in another half hour he was progressing rapidly and but for an exceptional word now and again he found it very plain sailing
here is what he read  west coast of africa about  degrees south       latitude
so mr clayton says
february  
 
dearest hazel  it seems foolish to write you a letter that you may never see but i simply must tell somebody of our awful experiences since we sailed from europe on the illfated arrow
if we never return to civilization as now seems only too likely this will at least prove a brief record of the events which led up to our final fate whatever it may be
as you know we were supposed to have set out upon a scientific expedition to the congo
papa was presumed to entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient civilization the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the congo valley
but after we were well under sail the truth came out
it seems that an old bookworm who has a book and curio shop in baltimore discovered between the leaves of a very old spanish manuscript a letter written in  detailing the adventures of a crew of mutineers of a spanish galleon bound from spain to south america with a vast treasure of doubloons and pieces of eight i suppose for they certainly sound weird and piraty
the writer had been one of the crew and the letter was to his son who was at the very time the letter was written master of a spanish merchantman
many years had elapsed since the events the letter narrated had transpired and the old man had become a respected citizen of an obscure spanish town but the love of gold was still so strong upon him that he risked all to acquaint his son with the means of attaining fabulous wealth for them both
the writer told how when but a week out from spain the crew had mutinied and murdered every officer and man who opposed them but they defeated their own ends by this very act for there was none left competent to navigate a ship at sea
they were blown hither and thither for two months until sick and dying of scurvy starvation and thirst they had been wrecked on a small islet
the galleon was washed high upon the beach where she went to pieces but not before the survivors who numbered but ten souls had rescued one of the great chests of treasure
this they buried well up on the island and for three years they lived there in constant hope of being rescued
one by one they sickened and died until only one man was left the writer of the letter
the men had built a boat from the wreckage of the galleon but having no idea where the island was located they had not dared to put to sea
when all were dead except himself however the awful loneliness so weighed upon the mind of the sole survivor that he could endure it no longer and choosing to risk death upon the open sea rather than madness on the lonely isle he set sail in his little boat after nearly a year of solitude
fortunately he sailed due north and within a week was in the track of the spanish merchantmen plying between the west indies and spain and was picked up by one of these vessels homeward bound
the story he told was merely one of shipwreck in which all but a few had perished the balance except himself dying after they reached the island
he did not mention the mutiny or the chest of buried treasure
the master of the merchantman assured him that from the position at which they had picked him up and the prevailing winds for the past week he could have been on no other island than one of the cape verde group which lie off the west coast of africa in about  degrees or  degrees north latitude
his letter described the island minutely as well as the location of the treasure and was accompanied by the crudest funniest little old map you ever saw with trees and rocks all marked by scrawly x's to show the exact spot where the treasure had been buried
when papa explained the real nature of the expedition my heart sank for i know so well how visionary and impractical the poor dear has always been that i feared that he had again been duped especially when he told me he had paid a thousand dollars for the letter and map
to add to my distress i learned that he had borrowed ten thousand dollars more from robert canler and had given his notes for the amount
mr canler had asked for no security and you know dearie what that will mean for me if papa cannot meet them
oh how i detest that man
we all tried to look on the bright side of things but mr philander and mr claytonhe joined us in london just for the adventureboth felt as skeptical as i
well to make a long story short we found the island and the treasurea great ironbound oak chest wrapped in many layers of oiled sailcloth and as strong and firm as when it had been buried nearly two hundred years ago
it was simply filled with gold coin and was so heavy that four men bent underneath its weight
the horrid thing seems to bring nothing but murder and misfortune to those who have anything to do with it for three days after we sailed from the cape verde islands our own crew mutinied and killed every one of their officers
oh it was the most terrifying experience one could imaginei cannot even write of it
they were going to kill us too but one of them the leader named king would not let them and so they sailed south along the coast to a lonely spot where they found a good harbor and here they landed and have left us
they sailed away with the treasure today but mr clayton says they will meet with a fate similar to the mutineers of the ancient galleon because king the only man aboard who knew aught of navigation was murdered on the beach by one of the men the day we landed
i wish you could know mr clayton he is the dearest fellow imaginable and unless i am mistaken he has fallen very much in love with me
he is the only son of lord greystoke and some day will inherit the title and estates
in addition he is wealthy in his own right but the fact that he is going to be an english lord makes me very sadyou know what my sentiments have always been relative to american girls who married titled foreigners
oh if he were only a plain american gentleman
but it isn't his fault poor fellow and in everything except birth he would do credit to my country and that is the greatest compliment i know how to pay any man
we have had the most weird experiences since we were landed here
papa and mr philander lost in the jungle and chased by a real lion
mr clayton lost and attacked twice by wild beasts
esmeralda and i cornered in an old cabin by a perfectly awful maneating lioness
oh it was simply terrifical as esmeralda would say
but the strangest part of it all is the wonderful creature who rescued us
i have not seen him but mr clayton and papa and mr philander have and they say that he is a perfectly godlike white man tanned to a dusky brown with the strength of a wild elephant the agility of a monkey and the bravery of a lion
he speaks no english and vanishes as quickly and as mysteriously after he has performed some valorous deed as though he were a disembodied spirit
then we have another weird neighbor who printed a beautiful sign in english and tacked it on the door of his cabin which we have preempted warning us to destroy none of his belongings and signing himself tarzan of the apes
we have never seen him though we think he is about for one of the sailors who was going to shoot mr clayton in the back received a spear in his shoulder from some unseen hand in the jungle
the sailors left us but a meager supply of food so as we have only a single revolver with but three cartridges left in it we do not know how we can procure meat though mr philander says that we can exist indefinitely on the wild fruit and nuts which abound in the jungle
i am very tired now so i shall go to my funny bed of grasses which mr clayton gathered for me but will add to this from day to day as things happen
lovingly                                   jane porter
to hazel strong baltimore md
tarzan sat in a brown study for a long time after he finished reading the letter
it was filled with so many new and wonderful things that his brain was in a whirl as he attempted to digest them all
so they did not know that he was tarzan of the apes
he would tell them
in his tree he had constructed a rude shelter of leaves and boughs beneath which protected from the rain he had placed the few treasures brought from the cabin
among these were some pencils
he took one and beneath jane porter's signature he wrote        i am tarzan of the apes   he thought that would be sufficient
later he would return the letter to the cabin
in the matter of food thought tarzan they had no need to worryhe would provide and he did
the next morning jane found her missing letter in the exact spot from which it had disappeared two nights before
she was mystified but when she saw the printed words beneath her signature she felt a cold clammy chill run up her spine
she showed the letter or rather the last sheet with the signature to clayton
and to think she said that uncanny thing was probably watching me all the time that i was writingoo
it makes me shudder just to think of it
but he must be friendly reassured clayton for he has returned your letter nor did he offer to harm you and unless i am mistaken he left a very substantial memento of his friendship outside the cabin door last night for i just found the carcass of a wild boar there as i came out
from then on scarcely a day passed that did not bring its offering of game or other food
sometimes it was a young deer again a quantity of strange cooked foodcassava cakes pilfered from the village of mbongaor a boar or leopard and once a lion
tarzan derived the greatest pleasure of his life in hunting meat for these strangers
it seemed to him that no pleasure on earth could compare with laboring for the welfare and protection of the beautiful white girl
some day he would venture into the camp in daylight and talk with these people through the medium of the little bugs which were familiar to them and to tarzan
but he found it difficult to overcome the timidity of the wild thing of the forest and so day followed day without seeing a fulfillment of his good intentions
the party in the camp emboldened by familiarity wandered farther and yet farther into the jungle in search of nuts and fruit
scarcely a day passed that did not find professor porter straying in his preoccupied indifference toward the jaws of death
mr samuel t philander never what one might call robust was worn to the shadow of a shadow through the ceaseless worry and mental distraction resultant from his herculean efforts to safeguard the professor
a month passed
tarzan had finally determined to visit the camp by daylight
it was early afternoon
clayton had wandered to the point at the harbor's mouth to look for passing vessels
here he kept a great mass of wood high piled ready to be ignited as a signal should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon
professor porter was wandering along the beach south of the camp with mr philander at his elbow urging him to turn his steps back before the two became again the sport of some savage beast
the others gone jane and esmeralda had wandered into the jungle to gather fruit and in their search were led farther and farther from the cabin
tarzan waited in silence before the door of the little house until they should return
his thoughts were of the beautiful white girl
they were always of her now
he wondered if she would fear him and the thought all but caused him to relinquish his plan
he was rapidly becoming impatient for her return that he might feast his eyes upon her and be near her perhaps touch her
the apeman knew no god but he was as near to worshipping his divinity as mortal man ever comes to worship
while he waited he passed the time printing a message to her whether he intended giving it to her he himself could not have told but he took infinite pleasure in seeing his thoughts expressed in printin which he was not so uncivilized after all
he wrote   i am tarzan of the apes
i want you
i am yours
you are mine
we live here together always in my house
i will bring you the best of fruits the tenderest deer the finest meats that roam the jungle
i will hunt for you
i am the greatest of the jungle fighters
i will fight for you
i am the mightiest of the jungle fighters
you are jane porter i saw it in your letter
when you see this you will know that it is for you and that tarzan of the apes loves you
as he stood straight as a young indian by the door waiting after he had finished the message there came to his keen ears a familiar sound
it was the passing of a great ape through the lower branches of the forest
for an instant he listened intently and then from the jungle came the agonized scream of a woman and tarzan of the apes dropping his first love letter upon the ground shot like a panther into the forest
clayton also heard the scream and professor porter and mr philander and in a few minutes they came panting to the cabin calling out to each other a volley of excited questions as they approached
a glance within confirmed their worst fears
jane and esmeralda were not there
instantly clayton followed by the two old men plunged into the jungle calling the girl's name aloud
for half an hour they stumbled on until clayton by merest chance came upon the prostrate form of esmeralda
he stopped beside her feeling for her pulse and then listening for her heartbeats
she lived
he shook her
esmeralda
he shrieked in her ear
esmeralda
for god's sake where is miss porter
what has happened
esmeralda
slowly esmeralda opened her eyes
she saw clayton
she saw the jungle about her
oh gaberelle
she screamed and fainted again
by this time professor porter and mr philander had come up
what shall we do mr
clayton
asked the old professor
where shall we look
god could not have been so cruel as to take my little girl away from me now
we must arouse esmeralda first replied clayton
she can tell us what has happened
esmeralda
he cried again shaking the black woman roughly by the shoulder
o gaberelle i want to die
cried the poor woman but with eyes fast closed
let me die dear lord don't let me see that awful face again
come come esmeralda cried clayton
the lord isn't here it's mr clayton
open your eyes
esmeralda did as she was bade
o gaberelle
thank the lord she said
where's miss porter
what happened
questioned clayton
ain't miss jane here
cried esmeralda sitting up with wonderful celerity for one of her bulk
oh lord now i remember
it must have took her away and the negress commenced to sob and wail her lamentations
what took her away
cried professor porter
a great big giant all covered with hair
a gorilla esmeralda
questioned mr philander and the three men scarcely breathed as he voiced the horrible thought
i thought it was the devil but i guess it must have been one of them gorilephants
oh my poor baby my poor little honey and again esmeralda broke into uncontrollable sobbing
clayton immediately began to look about for tracks but he could find nothing save a confusion of trampled grasses in the close vicinity and his woodcraft was too meager for the translation of what he did see
all the balance of the day they sought through the jungle but as night drew on they were forced to give up in despair and hopelessness for they did not even know in what direction the thing had borne jane
it was long after dark ere they reached the cabin and a sad and griefstricken party it was that sat silently within the little structure
professor porter finally broke the silence
his tones were no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract and the unknowable but those of the man of actiondetermined but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from clayton's heart
i shall lie down now said the old man and try to sleep
early tomorrow as soon as it is light i shall take what food i can carry and continue the search until i have found jane
i will not return without her
his companions did not reply at once
each was immersed in his own sorrowful thoughts and each knew as did the old professor what the last words meantprofessor porter would never return from the jungle
at length clayton arose and laid his hand gently upon professor porter's bent old shoulder
i shall go with you of course he said
i knew that you would offerthat you would wish to go mr clayton but you must not
jane is beyond human assistance now
what was once my dear little girl shall not lie alone and friendless in the awful jungle
the same vines and leaves will cover us the same rains beat upon us and when the spirit of her mother is abroad it will find us together in death as it has always found us in life
no it is i alone who may go for she was my daughterall that was left on earth for me to love
i shall go with you said clayton simply
the old man looked up regarding the strong handsome face of william cecil clayton intently
perhaps he read there the love that lay in the heart beneaththe love for his daughter
he had been too preoccupied with his own scholarly thoughts in the past to consider the little occurrences the chance words which would have indicated to a more practical man that these young people were being drawn more and more closely to one another
now they came back to him one by one
as you wish he said
you may count on me also said mr philander
no my dear old friend said professor porter
we may not all go
it would be cruelly wicked to leave poor esmeralda here alone and three of us would be no more successful than one
there be enough dead things in the cruel forest as it is
comelet us try to sleep a little
chapter xix  the call of the primitive   from the time tarzan left the tribe of great anthropoids in which he had been raised it was torn by continual strife and discord
terkoz proved a cruel and capricious king so that one by one many of the older and weaker apes upon whom he was particularly prone to vent his brutish nature took their families and sought the quiet and safety of the far interior
but at last those who remained were driven to desperation by the continued truculence of terkoz and it so happened that one of them recalled the parting admonition of tarzan  if you have a chief who is cruel do not do as the other apes do and attempt any one of you to pit yourself against him alone
but instead let two or three or four of you attack him together
then if you will do this no chief will dare to be other than he should be for four of you can kill any chief who may ever be over you
and the ape who recalled this wise counsel repeated it to several of his fellows so that when terkoz returned to the tribe that day he found a warm reception awaiting him
there were no formalities
as terkoz reached the group five huge hairy beasts sprang upon him
at heart he was an arrant coward which is the way with bullies among apes as well as among men so he did not remain to fight and die but tore himself away from them as quickly as he could and fled into the sheltering boughs of the forest
two more attempts he made to rejoin the tribe but on each occasion he was set upon and driven away
at last he gave it up and turned foaming with rage and hatred into the jungle
for several days he wandered aimlessly nursing his spite and looking for some weak thing on which to vent his pent anger
it was in this state of mind that the horrible manlike beast swinging from tree to tree came suddenly upon two women in the jungle
he was right above them when he discovered them
the first intimation jane porter had of his presence was when the great hairy body dropped to the earth beside her and she saw the awful face and the snarling hideous mouth thrust within a foot of her
one piercing scream escaped her lips as the brute hand clutched her arm
then she was dragged toward those awful fangs which yawned at her throat
but ere they touched that fair skin another mood claimed the anthropoid
the tribe had kept his women
he must find others to replace them
this hairless white ape would be the first of his new household and so he threw her roughly across his broad hairy shoulders and leaped back into the trees bearing jane away
esmeralda's scream of terror had mingled once with that of jane and then as was esmeralda's manner under stress of emergency which required presence of mind she swooned
but jane did not once lose consciousness
it is true that that awful face pressing close to hers and the stench of the foul breath beating upon her nostrils paralyzed her with terror but her brain was clear and she comprehended all that transpired
with what seemed to her marvelous rapidity the brute bore her through the forest but still she did not cry out or struggle
the sudden advent of the ape had confused her to such an extent that she thought now that he was bearing her toward the beach
for this reason she conserved her energies and her voice until she could see that they had approached near enough to the camp to attract the succor she craved
she could not have known it but she was being borne farther and farther into the impenetrable jungle
the scream that had brought clayton and the two older men stumbling through the undergrowth had led tarzan of the apes straight to where esmeralda lay but it was not esmeralda in whom his interest centered though pausing over her he saw that she was unhurt
for a moment he scrutinized the ground below and the trees above until the ape that was in him by virtue of training and environment combined with the intelligence that was his by right of birth told his wondrous woodcraft the whole story as plainly as though he had seen the thing happen with his own eyes
and then he was gone again into the swaying trees following the highflung spoor which no other human eye could have detected much less translated
at boughs' ends where the anthropoid swings from one tree to another there is most to mark the trail but least to point the direction of the quarry for there the pressure is downward always toward the small end of the branch whether the ape be leaving or entering a tree
nearer the center of the tree where the signs of passage are fainter the direction is plainly marked
here on this branch a caterpillar has been crushed by the fugitive's great foot and tarzan knows instinctively where that same foot would touch in the next stride
here he looks to find a tiny particle of the demolished larva ofttimes not more than a speck of moisture
again a minute bit of bark has been upturned by the scraping hand and the direction of the break indicates the direction of the passage
or some great limb or the stem of the tree itself has been brushed by the hairy body and a tiny shred of hair tells him by the direction from which it is wedged beneath the bark that he is on the right trail
nor does he need to check his speed to catch these seemingly faint records of the fleeing beast
to tarzan they stand out boldly against all the myriad other scars and bruises and signs upon the leafy way
but strongest of all is the scent for tarzan is pursuing up the wind and his trained nostrils are as sensitive as a hound's
there are those who believe that the lower orders are specially endowed by nature with better olfactory nerves than man but it is merely a matter of development
man's survival does not hinge so greatly upon the perfection of his senses
his power to reason has relieved them of many of their duties and so they have to some extent atrophied as have the muscles which move the ears and scalp merely from disuse
the muscles are there about the ears and beneath the scalp and so are the nerves which transmit sensations to the brain but they are underdeveloped because they are not needed
not so with tarzan of the apes
from early infancy his survival had depended upon acuteness of eyesight hearing smell touch and taste far more than upon the more slowly developed organ of reason
the least developed of all in tarzan was the sense of taste for he could eat luscious fruits or raw flesh long buried with almost equal appreciation but in that he differed but slightly from more civilized epicures
almost silently the apeman sped on in the track of terkoz and his prey but the sound of his approach reached the ears of the fleeing beast and spurred it on to greater speed
three miles were covered before tarzan overtook them and then terkoz seeing that further flight was futile dropped to the ground in a small open glade that he might turn and fight for his prize or be free to escape unhampered if he saw that the pursuer was more than a match for him
he still grasped jane in one great arm as tarzan bounded like a leopard into the arena which nature had provided for this primevallike battle
when terkoz saw that it was tarzan who pursued him he jumped to the conclusion that this was tarzan's woman since they were of the same kindwhite and hairlessand so he rejoiced at this opportunity for double revenge upon his hated enemy
to jane the strange apparition of this godlike man was as wine to sick nerves
from the description which clayton and her father and mr philander had given her she knew that it must be the same wonderful creature who had saved them and she saw in him only a protector and a friend
but as terkoz pushed her roughly aside to meet tarzan's charge and she saw the great proportions of the ape and the mighty muscles and the fierce fangs her heart quailed
how could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist
like two charging bulls they came together and like two wolves sought each other's throat
against the long canines of the ape was pitted the thin blade of the man's knife
janeher lithe young form flattened against the trunk of a great tree her hands tight pressed against her rising and falling bosom and her eyes wide with mingled horror fascination fear and admirationwatched the primordial ape battle with the primeval man for possession of a womanfor her
as the great muscles of the man's back and shoulders knotted beneath the tension of his efforts and the huge biceps and forearm held at bay those mighty tusks the veil of centuries of civilization and culture was swept from the blurred vision of the baltimore girl
when the long knife drank deep a dozen times of terkoz' heart's blood and the great carcass rolled lifeless upon the ground it was a primeval woman who sprang forward with outstretched arms toward the primeval man who had fought for her and won her
and tarzan
he did what no redblooded man needs lessons in doing
he took his woman in his arms and smothered her upturned panting lips with kisses
for a moment jane lay there with halfclosed eyes
for a momentthe first in her young lifeshe knew the meaning of love
but as suddenly as the veil had been withdrawn it dropped again and an outraged conscience suffused her face with its scarlet mantle and a mortified woman thrust tarzan of the apes from her and buried her face in her hands
tarzan had been surprised when he had found the girl he had learned to love after a vague and abstract manner a willing prisoner in his arms
now he was surprised that she repulsed him
he came close to her once more and took hold of her arm
she turned upon him like a tigress striking his great breast with her tiny hands
tarzan could not understand it
a moment ago and it had been his intention to hasten jane back to her people but that little moment was lost now in the dim and distant past of things which were but can never be again and with it the good intentions had gone to join the impossible
since then tarzan of the apes had felt a warm lithe form close pressed to his
hot sweet breath against his cheek and mouth had fanned a new flame to life within his breast and perfect lips had clung to his in burning kisses that had seared a deep brand into his soula brand which marked a new tarzan
again he laid his hand upon her arm
again she repulsed him
and then tarzan of the apes did just what his first ancestor would have done
he took his woman in his arms and carried her into the jungle
early the following morning the four within the little cabin by the beach were awakened by the booming of a cannon
clayton was the first to rush out and there beyond the harbor's mouth he saw two vessels lying at anchor
one was the arrow and the other a small french cruiser
the sides of the latter were crowded with men gazing shoreward and it was evident to clayton as to the others who had now joined him that the gun which they had heard had been fired to attract their attention if they still remained at the cabin
both vessels lay at a considerable distance from shore and it was doubtful if their glasses would locate the waving hats of the little party far in between the harbor's points
esmeralda had removed her red apron and was waving it frantically above her head but clayton still fearing that even this might not be seen hurried off toward the northern point where lay his signal pyre ready for the match
it seemed an age to him as to those who waited breathlessly behind ere he reached the great pile of dry branches and underbrush
as he broke from the dense wood and came in sight of the vessels again he was filled with consternation to see that the arrow was making sail and that the cruiser was already under way
quickly lighting the pyre in a dozen places he hurried to the extreme point of the promontory where he stripped off his shirt and tying it to a fallen branch stood waving it back and forth above him
but still the vessels continued to stand out and he had given up all hope when the great column of smoke rising above the forest in one dense vertical shaft attracted the attention of a lookout aboard the cruiser and instantly a dozen glasses were leveled on the beach
presently clayton saw the two ships come about again and while the arrow lay drifting quietly on the ocean the cruiser steamed slowly back toward shore
at some distance away she stopped and a boat was lowered and dispatched toward the beach
as it was drawn up a young officer stepped out
monsieur clayton i presume
he asked
thank god you have come
was clayton's reply
and it may be that it is not too late even now
what do you mean monsieur
asked the officer
clayton told of the abduction of jane porter and the need of armed men to aid in the search for her
mon dieu
exclaimed the officer sadly
yesterday and it would not have been too late
today and it may be better that the poor lady were never found
it is horrible monsieur
it is too horrible
other boats had now put off from the cruiser and clayton having pointed out the harbor's entrance to the officer entered the boat with him and its nose was turned toward the little landlocked bay into which the other craft followed
soon the entire party had landed where stood professor porter mr philander and the weeping esmeralda
among the officers in the last boats to put off from the cruiser was the commander of the vessel and when he had heard the story of jane's abduction he generously called for volunteers to accompany professor porter and clayton in their search
not an officer or a man was there of those brave and sympathetic frenchmen who did not quickly beg leave to be one of the expedition
the commander selected twenty men and two officers lieutenant d'arnot and lieutenant charpentier
a boat was dispatched to the cruiser for provisions ammunition and carbines the men were already armed with revolvers
then to clayton's inquiries as to how they had happened to anchor off shore and fire a signal gun the commander captain dufranne explained that a month before they had sighted the arrow bearing southwest under considerable canvas and that when they had signaled her to come about she had but crowded on more sail
they had kept her hullup until sunset firing several shots after her but the next morning she was nowhere to be seen
they had then continued to cruise up and down the coast for several weeks and had about forgotten the incident of the recent chase when early one morning a few days before the lookout had described a vessel laboring in the trough of a heavy sea and evidently entirely out of control
as they steamed nearer to the derelict they were surprised to note that it was the same vessel that had run from them a few weeks earlier
her forestaysail and mizzen spanker were set as though an effort had been made to hold her head up into the wind but the sheets had parted and the sails were tearing to ribbons in the half gale of wind
in the high sea that was running it was a difficult and dangerous task to attempt to put a prize crew aboard her and as no signs of life had been seen above deck it was decided to stand by until the wind and sea abated but just then a figure was seen clinging to the rail and feebly waving a mute signal of despair toward them
immediately a boat's crew was ordered out and an attempt was successfully made to board the arrow
the sight that met the frenchmen's eyes as they clambered over the ship's side was appalling
a dozen dead and dying men rolled hither and thither upon the pitching deck the living intermingled with the dead
two of the corpses appeared to have been partially devoured as though by wolves
the prize crew soon had the vessel under proper sail once more and the living members of the illstarred company carried below to their hammocks
the dead were wrapped in tarpaulins and lashed on deck to be identified by their comrades before being consigned to the deep
none of the living was conscious when the frenchmen reached the arrow's deck
even the poor devil who had waved the single despairing signal of distress had lapsed into unconsciousness before he had learned whether it had availed or not
it did not take the french officer long to learn what had caused the terrible condition aboard for when water and brandy were sought to restore the men it was found that there was none nor even food of any description
he immediately signalled to the cruiser to send water medicine and provisions and another boat made the perilous trip to the arrow
when restoratives had been applied several of the men regained consciousness and then the whole story was told
that part of it we know up to the sailing of the arrow after the murder of snipes and the burial of his body above the treasure chest
it seems that the pursuit by the cruiser had so terrorized the mutineers that they had continued out across the atlantic for several days after losing her but on discovering the meager supply of water and provisions aboard they had turned back toward the east
with no one on board who understood navigation discussions soon arose as to their whereabouts and as three days' sailing to the east did not raise land they bore off to the north fearing that the high north winds that had prevailed had driven them south of the southern extremity of africa
they kept on a northnortheasterly course for two days when they were overtaken by a calm which lasted for nearly a week
their water was gone and in another day they would be without food
conditions changed rapidly from bad to worse
one man went mad and leaped overboard
soon another opened his veins and drank his own blood
when he died they threw him overboard also though there were those among them who wanted to keep the corpse on board
hunger was changing them from human beasts to wild beasts
two days before they had been picked up by the cruiser they had become too weak to handle the vessel and that same day three men died
on the following morning it was seen that one of the corpses had been partially devoured
all that day the men lay glaring at each other like beasts of prey and the following morning two of the corpses lay almost entirely stripped of flesh
the men were but little stronger for their ghoulish repast for the want of water was by far the greatest agony with which they had to contend
and then the cruiser had come
when those who could had recovered the entire story had been told to the french commander but the men were too ignorant to be able to tell him at just what point on the coast the professor and his party had been marooned so the cruiser had steamed slowly along within sight of land firing occasional signal guns and scanning every inch of the beach with glasses
they had anchored by night so as not to neglect a particle of the shore line and it had happened that the preceding night had brought them off the very beach where lay the little camp they sought
the signal guns of the afternoon before had not been heard by those on shore it was presumed because they had doubtless been in the thick of the jungle searching for jane porter where the noise of their own crashing through the underbrush would have drowned the report of a far distant gun
by the time the two parties had narrated their several adventures the cruiser's boat had returned with supplies and arms for the expedition
within a few minutes the little body of sailors and the two french officers together with professor porter and clayton set off upon their hopeless and illfated quest into the untracked jungle
chapter xx  heredity   when jane realized that she was being borne away a captive by the strange forest creature who had rescued her from the clutches of the ape she struggled desperately to escape but the strong arms that held her as easily as though she had been but a dayold babe only pressed a little more tightly
so presently she gave up the futile effort and lay quietly looking through halfclosed lids at the face of the man who strode easily through the tangled undergrowth with her
the face above her was one of extraordinary beauty
a perfect type of the strongly masculine unmarred by dissipation or brutal or degrading passions
for though tarzan of the apes was a killer of men and of beasts he killed as the hunter kills dispassionately except on those rare occasions when he had killed for hatethough not the brooding malevolent hate which marks the features of its own with hideous lines
when tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled and smiles are the foundation of beauty
one thing the girl had noticed particularly when she had seen tarzan rushing upon terkozthe vivid scarlet band upon his forehead from above the left eye to the scalp but now as she scanned his features she noticed that it was gone and only a thin white line marked the spot where it had been
as she lay more quietly in his arms tarzan slightly relaxed his grip upon her
once he looked down into her eyes and smiled and the girl had to close her own to shut out the vision of that handsome winning face
presently tarzan took to the trees and jane wondering that she felt no fear began to realize that in many respects she had never felt more secure in her whole life than now as she lay in the arms of this strong wild creature being borne god alone knew where or to what fate deeper and deeper into the savage fastness of the untamed forest
when with closed eyes she commenced to speculate upon the future and terrifying fears were conjured by a vivid imagination she had but to raise her lids and look upon that noble face so close to hers to dissipate the last remnant of apprehension
no he could never harm her of that she was convinced when she translated the fine features and the frank brave eyes above her into the chivalry which they proclaimed
on and on they went through what seemed to jane a solid mass of verdure yet ever there appeared to open before this forest god a passage as by magic which closed behind them as they passed
scarce a branch scraped against her yet above and below before and behind the view presented naught but a solid mass of inextricably interwoven branches and creepers
as tarzan moved steadily onward his mind was occupied with many strange and new thoughts
here was a problem the like of which he had never encountered and he felt rather than reasoned that he must meet it as a man and not as an ape
the free movement through the middle terrace which was the route he had followed for the most part had helped to cool the ardor of the first fierce passion of his new found love
now he discovered himself speculating upon the fate which would have fallen to the girl had he not rescued her from terkoz
he knew why the ape had not killed her and he commenced to compare his intentions with those of terkoz
true it was the order of the jungle for the male to take his mate by force but could tarzan be guided by the laws of the beasts
was not tarzan a man
but what did men do
he was puzzled for he did not know
he wished that he might ask the girl and then it came to him that she had already answered him in the futile struggle she had made to escape and to repulse him
but now they had come to their destination and tarzan of the apes with jane in his strong arms swung lightly to the turf of the arena where the great apes held their councils and danced the wild orgy of the dumdum
though they had come many miles it was still but midafternoon and the amphitheater was bathed in the half light which filtered through the maze of encircling foliage
the green turf looked soft and cool and inviting
the myriad noises of the jungle seemed far distant and hushed to a mere echo of blurred sounds rising and falling like the surf upon a remote shore
a feeling of dreamy peacefulness stole over jane as she sank down upon the grass where tarzan had placed her and as she looked up at his great figure towering above her there was added a strange sense of perfect security
as she watched him from beneath halfclosed lids tarzan crossed the little circular clearing toward the trees upon the further side
she noted the graceful majesty of his carriage the perfect symmetry of his magnificent figure and the poise of his wellshaped head upon his broad shoulders
what a perfect creature
there could be naught of cruelty or baseness beneath that godlike exterior
never she thought had such a man strode the earth since god created the first in his own image
with a bound tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared
jane wondered where he had gone
had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle
she glanced nervously about
every vine and bush seemed but the lurkingplace of some huge and horrible beast waiting to bury gleaming fangs into her soft flesh
every sound she magnified into the stealthy creeping of a sinuous and malignant body
how different now that he had left her
for a few minutes that seemed hours to the frightened girl she sat with tense nerves waiting for the spring of the crouching thing that was to end her misery of apprehension
she almost prayed for the cruel teeth that would give her unconsciousness and surcease from the agony of fear
she heard a sudden slight sound behind her
with a cry she sprang to her feet and turned to face her end
there stood tarzan his arms filled with ripe and luscious fruit
jane reeled and would have fallen had not tarzan dropping his burden caught her in his arms
she did not lose consciousness but she clung tightly to him shuddering and trembling like a frightened deer
tarzan of the apes stroked her soft hair and tried to comfort and quiet her as kala had him when as a little ape he had been frightened by sabor the lioness or histah the snake
once he pressed his lips lightly upon her forehead and she did not move but closed her eyes and sighed
she could not analyze her feelings nor did she wish to attempt it
she was satisfied to feel the safety of those strong arms and to leave her future to fate for the last few hours had taught her to trust this strange wild creature of the forest as she would have trusted but few of the men of her acquaintance
as she thought of the strangeness of it there commenced to dawn upon her the realization that she had possibly learned something else which she had never really known beforelove
she wondered and then she smiled
and still smiling she pushed tarzan gently away and looking at him with a halfsmiling halfquizzical expression that made her face wholly entrancing she pointed to the fruit upon the ground and seated herself upon the edge of the earthen drum of the anthropoids for hunger was asserting itself
tarzan quickly gathered up the fruit and bringing it laid it at her feet and then he too sat upon the drum beside her and with his knife opened and prepared the various fruits for her meal
together and in silence they ate occasionally stealing sly glances at one another until finally jane broke into a merry laugh in which tarzan joined
i wish you spoke english said the girl
tarzan shook his head and an expression of wistful and pathetic longing sobered his laughing eyes
then jane tried speaking to him in french and then in german but she had to laugh at her own blundering attempt at the latter tongue
anyway she said to him in english you understand my german as well as they did in berlin
tarzan had long since reached a decision as to what his future procedure should be
he had had time to recollect all that he had read of the ways of men and women in the books at the cabin
he would act as he imagined the men in the books would have acted were they in his place
again he rose and went into the trees but first he tried to explain by means of signs that he would return shortly and he did so well that jane understood and was not afraid when he had gone
only a feeling of loneliness came over her and she watched the point where he had disappeared with longing eyes awaiting his return
as before she was appraised of his presence by a soft sound behind her and turned to see him coming across the turf with a great armful of branches
then he went back again into the jungle and in a few minutes reappeared with a quantity of soft grasses and ferns
two more trips he made until he had quite a pile of material at hand
then he spread the ferns and grasses upon the ground in a soft flat bed and above it leaned many branches together so that they met a few feet over its center
upon these he spread layers of huge leaves of the great elephant's ear and with more branches and more leaves he closed one end of the little shelter he had built
then they sat down together again upon the edge of the drum and tried to talk by signs
the magnificent diamond locket which hung about tarzan's neck had been a source of much wonderment to jane
she pointed to it now and tarzan removed it and handed the pretty bauble to her
she saw that it was the work of a skilled artisan and that the diamonds were of great brilliancy and superbly set but the cutting of them denoted that they were of a former day
she noticed too that the locket opened and pressing the hidden clasp she saw the two halves spring apart to reveal in either section an ivory miniature
one was of a beautiful woman and the other might have been a likeness of the man who sat beside her except for a subtle difference of expression that was scarcely definable
she looked up at tarzan to find him leaning toward her gazing on the miniatures with an expression of astonishment
he reached out his hand for the locket and took it away from her examining the likenesses within with unmistakable signs of surprise and new interest
his manner clearly denoted that he had never before seen them nor imagined that the locket opened
this fact caused jane to indulge in further speculation and it taxed her imagination to picture how this beautiful ornament came into the possession of a wild and savage creature of the unexplored jungles of africa
still more wonderful was how it contained the likeness of one who might be a brother or more likely the father of this woodland demigod who was even ignorant of the fact that the locket opened
tarzan was still gazing with fixity at the two faces
presently he removed the quiver from his shoulder and emptying the arrows upon the ground reached into the bottom of the baglike receptacle and drew forth a flat object wrapped in many soft leaves and tied with bits of long grass
carefully he unwrapped it removing layer after layer of leaves until at length he held a photograph in his hand
pointing to the miniature of the man within the locket he handed the photograph to jane holding the open locket beside it
the photograph only served to puzzle the girl still more for it was evidently another likeness of the same man whose picture rested in the locket beside that of the beautiful young woman
tarzan was looking at her with an expression of puzzled bewilderment in his eyes as she glanced up at him
he seemed to be framing a question with his lips
the girl pointed to the photograph and then to the miniature and then to him as though to indicate that she thought the likenesses were of him but he only shook his head and then shrugging his great shoulders he took the photograph from her and having carefully rewrapped it placed it again in the bottom of his quiver
for a few moments he sat in silence his eyes bent upon the ground while jane held the little locket in her hand turning it over and over in an endeavor to find some further clue that might lead to the identity of its original owner
at length a simple explanation occurred to her
the locket had belonged to lord greystoke and the likenesses were of himself and lady alice
this wild creature had simply found it in the cabin by the beach
how stupid of her not to have thought of that solution before
but to account for the strange likeness between lord greystoke and this forest godthat was quite beyond her and it is not strange that she could not imagine that this naked savage was indeed an english nobleman
at length tarzan looked up to watch the girl as she examined the locket
he could not fathom the meaning of the faces within but he could read the interest and fascination upon the face of the live young creature by his side
she noticed that he was watching her and thinking that he wished his ornament again she held it out to him
he took it from her and taking the chain in his two hands he placed it about her neck smiling at her expression of surprise at his unexpected gift
jane shook her head vehemently and would have removed the golden links from about her throat but tarzan would not let her
taking her hands in his when she insisted upon it he held them tightly to prevent her
at last she desisted and with a little laugh raised the locket to her lips
tarzan did not know precisely what she meant but he guessed correctly that it was her way of acknowledging the gift and so he rose and taking the locket in his hand stooped gravely like some courtier of old and pressed his lips upon it where hers had rested
it was a stately and gallant little compliment performed with the grace and dignity of utter unconsciousness of self
it was the hallmark of his aristocratic birth the natural outcropping of many generations of fine breeding an hereditary instinct of graciousness which a lifetime of uncouth and savage training and environment could not eradicate
it was growing dark now and so they ate again of the fruit which was both food and drink for them then tarzan rose and leading jane to the little bower he had erected motioned her to go within
for the first time in hours a feeling of fear swept over her and tarzan felt her draw away as though shrinking from him
contact with this girl for half a day had left a very diferent tarzan from the one on whom the morning's sun had risen
now in every fiber of his being heredity spoke louder than training
he had not in one swift transition become a polished gentleman from a savage apeman but at last the instincts of the former predominated and over all was the desire to please the woman he loved and to appear well in her eyes
so tarzan of the apes did the only thing he knew to assure jane of her safety
he removed his hunting knife from its sheath and handed it to her hilt first again motioning her into the bower
the girl understood and taking the long knife she entered and lay down upon the soft grasses while tarzan of the apes stretched himself upon the ground across the entrance
and thus the rising sun found them in the morning
when jane awoke she did not at first recall the strange events of the preceding day and so she wondered at her odd surroundingsthe little leafy bower the soft grasses of her bed the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her feet
slowly the circumstances of her position crept one by one into her mind
and then a great wonderment arose in her hearta mighty wave of thankfulness and gratitude that though she had been in such terrible danger yet she was unharmed
she moved to the entrance of the shelter to look for tarzan
he was gone but this time no fear assailed her for she knew that he would return
in the grass at the entrance to her bower she saw the imprint of his body where he had lain all night to guard her
she knew that the fact that he had been there was all that had permitted her to sleep in such peaceful security
with him near who could entertain fear
she wondered if there was another man on earth with whom a girl could feel so safe in the heart of this savage african jungle
even the lions and panthers had no fears for her now
she looked up to see his lithe form drop softly from a nearby tree
as he caught her eyes upon him his face lighted with that frank and radiant smile that had won her confidence the day before
as he approached her jane's heart beat faster and her eyes brightened as they had never done before at the approach of any man
he had again been gathering fruit and this he laid at the entrance of her bower
once more they sat down together to eat
jane commenced to wonder what his plans were
would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here
suddenly she realized that the matter did not seem to give her much concern
could it be that she did not care
she began to comprehend also that she was entirely contented sitting here by the side of this smiling giant eating delicious fruit in a sylvan paradise far within the remote depths of an african junglethat she was contented and very happy
she could not understand it
her reason told her that she should be torn by wild anxieties weighted by dread fears cast down by gloomy forebodings but instead her heart was singing and she was smiling into the answering face of the man beside her
when they had finished their breakfast tarzan went to her bower and recovered his knife
the girl had entirely forgotten it
she realized that it was because she had forgotten the fear that prompted her to accept it
motioning her to follow tarzan walked toward the trees at the edge of the arena and taking her in one strong arm swung to the branches above
the girl knew that he was taking her back to her people and she could not understand the sudden feeling of loneliness and sorrow which crept over her
for hours they swung slowly along
tarzan of the apes did not hurry
he tried to draw out the sweet pleasure of that journey with those dear arms about his neck as long as possible and so he went far south of the direct route to the beach
several times they halted for brief rests which tarzan did not need and at noon they stopped for an hour at a little brook where they quenched their thirst and ate
so it was nearly sunset when they came to the clearing and tarzan dropping to the ground beside a great tree parted the tall jungle grass and pointed out the little cabin to her
she took him by the hand to lead him to it that she might tell her father that this man had saved her from death and worse than death that he had watched over her as carefully as a mother might have done
but again the timidity of the wild thing in the face of human habitation swept over tarzan of the apes
he drew back shaking his head
the girl came close to him looking up with pleading eyes
somehow she could not bear the thought of his going back into the terrible jungle alone
still he shook his head and finally he drew her to him very gently and stooped to kiss her but first he looked into her eyes and waited to learn if she were pleased or if she would repulse him
just an instant the girl hesitated and then she realized the truth and throwing her arms about his neck she drew his face to hers and kissed himunashamed
i love youi love you she murmured
from far in the distance came the faint sound of many guns
tarzan and jane raised their heads
from the cabin came mr philander and esmeralda
from where tarzan and the girl stood they could not see the two vessels lying at anchor in the harbor
tarzan pointed toward the sounds touched his breast and pointed again
she understood
he was going and something told her that it was because he thought her people were in danger
again he kissed her
come back to me she whispered
i shall wait for youalways
he was goneand jane turned to walk across the clearing to the cabin
mr philander was the first to see her
it was dusk and mr philander was very near sighted
quickly esmeralda
he cried
let us seek safety within it is a lioness
bless me
esmeralda did not bother to verify mr philander's vision
his tone was enough
she was within the cabin and had slammed and bolted the door before he had finished pronouncing her name
the bless me was startled out of mr philander by the discovery that esmeralda in the exuberance of her haste had fastened him upon the same side of the door as was the closeapproaching lioness
he beat furiously upon the heavy portal
esmeralda
esmeralda
he shrieked
let me in
i am being devoured by a lion
esmeralda thought that the noise upon the door was made by the lioness in her attempts to pursue her so after her custom she fainted
mr philander cast a frightened glance behind him
horrors
the thing was quite close now
he tried to scramble up the side of the cabin and succeeded in catching a fleeting hold upon the thatched roof
for a moment he hung there clawing with his feet like a cat on a clothesline but presently a piece of the thatch came away and mr philander preceding it was precipitated upon his back
at the instant he fell a remarkable item of natural history leaped to his mind
if one feigns death lions and lionesses are supposed to ignore one according to mr philander's faulty memory
so mr philander lay as he had fallen frozen into the horrid semblance of death
as his arms and legs had been extended stiffly upward as he came to earth upon his back the attitude of death was anything but impressive
jane had been watching his antics in mildeyed surprise
now she laugheda little choking gurgle of a laugh but it was enough
mr philander rolled over upon his side and peered about
at length he discovered her
jane
he cried
jane porter
bless me
he scrambled to his feet and rushed toward her
he could not believe that it was she and alive
bless me
where did you come from
where in the world have you been
how  mercy mr philander interrupted the girl i can never remember so many questions
well well said mr philander
bless me
i am so filled with surprise and exuberant delight at seeing you safe and well again that i scarcely know what i am saying really
but come tell me all that has happened to you
chapter xxi  the village of torture   as the little expedition of sailors toiled through the dense jungle searching for signs of jane porter the futility of their venture became more and more apparent but the grief of the old man and the hopeless eyes of the young englishman prevented the kind hearted d'arnot from turning back
he thought that there might be a bare possibility of finding her body or the remains of it for he was positive that she had been devoured by some beast of prey
he deployed his men into a skirmish line from the point where esmeralda had been found and in this extended formation they pushed their way sweating and panting through the tangled vines and creepers
it was slow work
noon found them but a few miles inland
they halted for a brief rest then and after pushing on for a short distance further one of the men discovered a wellmarked trail
it was an old elephant track and d'arnot after consulting with professor porter and clayton decided to follow it
the path wound through the jungle in a northeasterly direction and along it the column moved in single file
lieutenant d'arnot was in the lead and moving at a quick pace for the trail was comparatively open
immediately behind him came professor porter but as he could not keep pace with the younger man d'arnot was a hundred yards in advance when suddenly a half dozen black warriors arose about him
d'arnot gave a warning shout to his column as the blacks closed on him but before he could draw his revolver he had been pinioned and dragged into the jungle
his cry had alarmed the sailors and a dozen of them sprang forward past professor porter running up the trail to their officer's aid
they did not know the cause of his outcry only that it was a warning of danger ahead
they had rushed past the spot where d'arnot had been seized when a spear hurled from the jungle transfixed one of the men and then a volley of arrows fell among them
raising their rifles they fired into the underbrush in the direction from which the missiles had come
by this time the balance of the party had come up and volley after volley was fired toward the concealed foe
it was these shots that tarzan and jane porter had heard
lieutenant charpentier who had been bringing up the rear of the column now came running to the scene and on hearing the details of the ambush ordered the men to follow him and plunged into the tangled vegetation
in an instant they were in a handtohand fight with some fifty black warriors of mbonga's village
arrows and bullets flew thick and fast
queer african knives and french gun butts mingled for a moment in savage and bloody duels but soon the natives fled into the jungle leaving the frenchmen to count their losses
four of the twenty were dead a dozen others were wounded and lieutenant d'arnot was missing
night was falling rapidly and their predicament was rendered doubly worse when they could not even find the elephant trail which they had been following
there was but one thing to do make camp where they were until daylight
lieutenant charpentier ordered a clearing made and a circular abatis of underbrush constructed about the camp
this work was not completed until long after dark the men building a huge fire in the center of the clearing to give them light to work by
when all was safe as possible against attack of wild beasts and savage men lieutenant charpentier placed sentries about the little camp and the tired and hungry men threw themselves upon the ground to sleep
the groans of the wounded mingled with the roaring and growling of the great beasts which the noise and firelight had attracted kept sleep except in its most fitful form from the tired eyes
it was a sad and hungry party that lay through the long night praying for dawn
the blacks who had seized d'arnot had not waited to participate in the fight which followed but instead had dragged their prisoner a little way through the jungle and then struck the trail further on beyond the scene of the fighting in which their fellows were engaged
they hurried him along the sounds of battle growing fainter and fainter as they drew away from the contestants until there suddenly broke upon d'arnot's vision a goodsized clearing at one end of which stood a thatched and palisaded village
it was now dusk but the watchers at the gate saw the approaching trio and distinguished one as a prisoner ere they reached the portals
a cry went up within the palisade
a great throng of women and children rushed out to meet the party
and then began for the french officer the most terrifying experience which man can encounter upon earththe reception of a white prisoner into a village of african cannibals
to add to the fiendishness of their cruel savagery was the poignant memory of still crueler barbarities practiced upon them and theirs by the white officers of that arch hypocrite leopold ii of belgium because of whose atrocities they had fled the congo free statea pitiful remnant of what once had been a mighty tribe
they fell upon d'arnot tooth and nail beating him with sticks and stones and tearing at him with clawlike hands
every vestige of clothing was torn from him and the merciless blows fell upon his bare and quivering flesh
but not once did the frenchman cry out in pain
he breathed a silent prayer that he be quickly delivered from his torture
but the death he prayed for was not to be so easily had
soon the warriors beat the women away from their prisoner
he was to be saved for nobler sport than this and the first wave of their passion having subsided they contented themselves with crying out taunts and insults and spitting upon him
presently they reached the center of the village
there d'arnot was bound securely to the great post from which no live man had ever been released
a number of the women scattered to their several huts to fetch pots and water while others built a row of fires on which portions of the feast were to be boiled while the balance would be slowly dried in strips for future use as they expected the other warriors to return with many prisoners
the festivities were delayed awaiting the return of the warriors who had remained to engage in the skirmish with the white men so that it was quite late when all were in the village and the dance of death commenced to circle around the doomed officer
half fainting from pain and exhaustion d'arnot watched from beneath halfclosed lids what seemed but the vagary of delirium or some horrid nightmare from which he must soon awake
the bestial faces daubed with colorthe huge mouths and flabby hanging lipsthe yellow teeth sharp filedthe rolling demon eyesthe shining naked bodiesthe cruel spears
surely no such creatures really existed upon earthhe must indeed be dreaming
the savage whirling bodies circled nearer
now a spear sprang forth and touched his arm
the sharp pain and the feel of hot trickling blood assured him of the awful reality of his hopeless position
another spear and then another touched him
he closed his eyes and held his teeth firm sethe would not cry out
he was a soldier of france and he would teach these beasts how an officer and a gentleman died
tarzan of the apes needed no interpreter to translate the story of those distant shots
with jane porter's kisses still warm upon his lips he was swinging with incredible rapidity through the forest trees straight toward the village of mbonga
he was not interested in the location of the encounter for he judged that that would soon be over
those who were killed he could not aid those who escaped would not need his assistance
it was to those who had neither been killed or escaped that he hastened
and he knew that he would find them by the great post in the center of mbonga village
many times had tarzan seen mbonga's black raiding parties return from the northward with prisoners and always were the same scenes enacted about that grim stake beneath the flaring light of many fires
he knew too that they seldom lost much time before consummating the fiendish purpose of their captures
he doubted that he would arrive in time to do more than avenge
on he sped
night had fallen and he traveled high along the upper terrace where the gorgeous tropic moon lighted the dizzy pathway through the gently undulating branches of the tree tops
presently he caught the reflection of a distant blaze
it lay to the right of his path
it must be the light from the camp fire the two men had built before they were attackedtarzan knew nothing of the presence of the sailors
so sure was tarzan of his jungle knowledge that he did not turn from his course but passed the glare at a distance of a half mile
it was the camp fire of the frenchmen
in a few minutes more tarzan swung into the trees above mbonga's village
ah he was not quite too late
or was he
he could not tell
the figure at the stake was very still yet the black warriors were but pricking it
tarzan knew their customs
the death blow had not been struck
he could tell almost to a minute how far the dance had gone
in another instant mbonga's knife would sever one of the victim's earsthat would mark the beginning of the end for very shortly after only a writhing mass of mutilated flesh would remain
there would still be life in it but death then would be the only charity it craved
the stake stood forty feet from the nearest tree
tarzan coiled his rope
then there rose suddenly above the fiendish cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the apeman
the dancers halted as though turned to stone
the rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of the blacks
it was quite invisible in the flaring lights of the camp fires
d'arnot opened his eyes
a huge black standing directly before him lunged backward as though felled by an invisible hand
struggling and shrieking his body rolling from side to side moved quickly toward the shadows beneath the trees
the blacks their eyes protruding in horror watched spellbound
once beneath the trees the body rose straight into the air and as it disappeared into the foliage above the terrified negroes screaming with fright broke into a mad race for the village gate
d'arnot was left alone
he was a brave man but he had felt the short hairs bristle upon the nape of his neck when that uncanny cry rose upon the air
as the writhing body of the black soared as though by unearthly power into the dense foliage of the forest d'arnot felt an icy shiver run along his spine as though death had risen from a dark grave and laid a cold and clammy finger on his flesh
as d'arnot watched the spot where the body had entered the tree he heard the sounds of movement there
the branches swayed as though under the weight of a man's bodythere was a crash and the black came sprawling to earth againto lie very quietly where he had fallen
immediately after him came a white body but this one alighted erect
d'arnot saw a cleanlimbed young giant emerge from the shadows into the firelight and come quickly toward him
what could it mean
who could it be
some new creature of torture and destruction doubtless
d'arnot waited
his eyes never left the face of the advancing man
nor did the other's frank clear eyes waver beneath d'arnot's fixed gaze
d'arnot was reassured but still without much hope though he felt that that face could not mask a cruel heart
without a word tarzan of the apes cut the bonds which held the frenchman
weak from suffering and loss of blood he would have fallen but for the strong arm that caught him
he felt himself lifted from the ground
there was a sensation as of flying and then he lost consciousness
chapter xxii  the search party   when dawn broke upon the little camp of frenchmen in the heart of the jungle it found a sad and disheartened group
as soon as it was light enough to see their surroundings lieutenant charpentier sent men in groups of three in several directions to locate the trail and in ten minutes it was found and the expedition was hurrying back toward the beach
it was slow work for they bore the bodies of six dead men two more having succumbed during the night and several of those who were wounded required support to move even very slowly
charpentier had decided to return to camp for reinforcements and then make an attempt to track down the natives and rescue d'arnot
it was late in the afternoon when the exhausted men reached the clearing by the beach but for two of them the return brought so great a happiness that all their suffering and heartbreaking grief was forgotten on the instant
as the little party emerged from the jungle the first person that professor porter and cecil clayton saw was jane standing by the cabin door
with a little cry of joy and relief she ran forward to greet them throwing her arms about her father's neck and bursting into tears for the first time since they had been cast upon this hideous and adventurous shore
professor porter strove manfully to suppress his own emotions but the strain upon his nerves and weakened vitality were too much for him and at length burying his old face in the girl's shoulder he sobbed quietly like a tired child
jane led him toward the cabin and the frenchmen turned toward the beach from which several of their fellows were advancing to meet them
clayton wishing to leave father and daughter alone joined the sailors and remained talking with the officers until their boat pulled away toward the cruiser whither lieutenant charpentier was bound to report the unhappy outcome of his adventure
then clayton turned back slowly toward the cabin
his heart was filled with happiness
the woman he loved was safe
he wondered by what manner of miracle she had been spared
to see her alive seemed almost unbelievable
as he approached the cabin he saw jane coming out
when she saw him she hurried forward to meet him
jane
he cried god has been good to us indeed
tell me how you escapedwhat form providence took to save you forus
he had never before called her by her given name
fortyeight hours before it would have suffused jane with a soft glow of pleasure to have heard that name from clayton's lipsnow it frightened her
mr clayton she said quietly extending her hand first let me thank you for your chivalrous loyalty to my dear father
he has told me how noble and selfsacrificing you have been
how can we repay you
clayton noticed that she did not return his familiar salutation but he felt no misgivings on that score
she had been through so much
this was no time to force his love upon her he quickly realized
i am already repaid he said
just to see you and professor porter both safe well and together again
i do not think that i could much longer have endured the pathos of his quiet and uncomplaining grief
it was the saddest experience of my life miss porter and then added to it there was my own griefthe greatest i have ever known
but his was so hopelesshis was pitiful
it taught me that no love not even that of a man for his wife may be so deep and terrible and selfsacrificing as the love of a father for his daughter
the girl bowed her head
there was a question she wanted to ask but it seemed almost sacrilegious in the face of the love of these two men and the terrible suffering they had endured while she sat laughing and happy beside a godlike creature of the forest eating delicious fruits and looking with eyes of love into answering eyes
but love is a strange master and human nature is still stranger so she asked her question
where is the forest man who went to rescue you
why did he not return
i do not understand said clayton
whom do you mean
he who has saved each of uswho saved me from the gorilla
oh cried clayton in surprise
it was he who rescued you
you have not told me anything of your adventure you know
but the wood man she urged
have you not seen him
when we heard the shots in the jungle very faint and far away he left me
we had just reached the clearing and he hurried off in the direction of the fighting
i know he went to aid you
her tone was almost pleadingher manner tense with suppressed emotion
clayton could not but notice it and he wondered vaguely why she was so deeply movedso anxious to know the whereabouts of this strange creature
yet a feeling of apprehension of some impending sorrow haunted him and in his breast unknown to himself was implanted the first germ of jealousy and suspicion of the apeman to whom he owed his life
we did not see him he replied quietly
he did not join us
and then after a moment of thoughtful pause  possibly he joined his own tribethe men who attacked us
he did not know why he had said it for he did not believe it
the girl looked at him wide eyed for a moment
no
she exclaimed vehemently much too vehemently he thought
it could not be
they were savages
clayton looked puzzled
he is a strange halfsavage creature of the jungle miss porter
we know nothing of him
he neither speaks nor understands any european tongueand his ornaments and weapons are those of the west coast savages
clayton was speaking rapidly
there are no other human beings than savages within hundreds of miles miss porter
he must belong to the tribes which attacked us or to some other equally savagehe may even be a cannibal
jane blanched
i will not believe it she half whispered
it is not true
you shall see she said addressing clayton that he will come back and that he will prove that you are wrong
you do not know him as i do
i tell you that he is a gentleman
clayton was a generous and chivalrous man but something in the girl's breathless defense of the forest man stirred him to unreasoning jealousy so that for the instant he forgot all that they owed to this wild demigod and he answered her with a half sneer upon his lip
possibly you are right miss porter he said but i do not think that any of us need worry about our carrioneating acquaintance
the chances are that he is some halfdemented castaway who will forget us more quickly but no more surely than we shall forget him
he is only a beast of the jungle miss porter
the girl did not answer but she felt her heart shrivel within her
she knew that clayton spoke merely what he thought and for the first time she began to analyze the structure which supported her newfound love and to subject its object to a critical examination
slowly she turned and walked back to the cabin
she tried to imagine her woodgod by her side in the saloon of an ocean liner
she saw him eating with his hands tearing his food like a beast of prey and wiping his greasy fingers upon his thighs
she shuddered
she saw him as she introduced him to her friendsuncouth illiteratea boor and the girl winced
she had reached her room now and as she sat upon the edge of her bed of ferns and grasses with one hand resting upon her rising and falling bosom she felt the hard outlines of the man's locket
she drew it out holding it in the palm of her hand for a moment with tearblurred eyes bent upon it
then she raised it to her lips and crushing it there buried her face in the soft ferns sobbing
beast
she murmured
then god make me a beast for man or beast i am yours
she did not see clayton again that day
esmeralda brought her supper to her and she sent word to her father that she was suffering from the reaction following her adventure
the next morning clayton left early with the relief expedition in search of lieutenant d'arnot
there were two hundred armed men this time with ten officers and two surgeons and provisions for a week
they carried bedding and hammocks the latter for transporting their sick and wounded
it was a determined and angry companya punitive expedition as well as one of relief
they reached the site of the skirmish of the previous expedition shortly after noon for they were now traveling a known trail and no time was lost in exploring
from there on the elephanttrack led straight to mbonga's village
it was but two o'clock when the head of the column halted upon the edge of the clearing
lieutenant charpentier who was in command immediately sent a portion of his force through the jungle to the opposite side of the village
another detachment was dispatched to a point before the village gate while he remained with the balance upon the south side of the clearing
it was arranged that the party which was to take its position to the north and which would be the last to gain its station should commence the assault and that their opening volley should be the signal for a concerted rush from all sides in an attempt to carry the village by storm at the first charge
for half an hour the men with lieutenant charpentier crouched in the dense foliage of the jungle waiting the signal
to them it seemed like hours
they could see natives in the fields and others moving in and out of the village gate
at length the signal camea sharp rattle of musketry and like one man an answering volley tore from the jungle to the west and to the south
the natives in the field dropped their implements and broke madly for the palisade
the french bullets mowed them down and the french sailors bounded over their prostrate bodies straight for the village gate
so sudden and unexpected the assault had been that the whites reached the gates before the frightened natives could bar them and in another minute the village street was filled with armed men fighting hand to hand in an inextricable tangle
for a few moments the blacks held their ground within the entrance to the street but the revolvers rifles and cutlasses of the frenchmen crumpled the native spearmen and struck down the black archers with their bows halfdrawn
soon the battle turned to a wild rout and then to a grim massacre for the french sailors had seen bits of d'arnot's uniform upon several of the black warriors who opposed them
they spared the children and those of the women whom they were not forced to kill in selfdefense but when at length they stopped panting blood covered and sweating it was because there lived to oppose them no single warrior of all the savage village of mbonga
carefully they ransacked every hut and corner of the village but no sign of d'arnot could they find
they questioned the prisoners by signs and finally one of the sailors who had served in the french congo found that he could make them understand the bastard tongue that passes for language between the whites and the more degraded tribes of the coast but even then they could learn nothing definite regarding the fate of d'arnot
only excited gestures and expressions of fear could they obtain in response to their inquiries concerning their fellow and at last they became convinced that these were but evidences of the guilt of these demons who had slaughtered and eaten their comrade two nights before
at length all hope left them and they prepared to camp for the night within the village
the prisoners were herded into three huts where they were heavily guarded
sentries were posted at the barred gates and finally the village was wrapped in the silence of slumber except for the wailing of the native women for their dead
the next morning they set out upon the return march
their original intention had been to burn the village but this idea was abandoned and the prisoners were left behind weeping and moaning but with roofs to cover them and a palisade for refuge from the beasts of the jungle
slowly the expedition retraced its steps of the preceding day
ten loaded hammocks retarded its pace
in eight of them lay the more seriously wounded while two swung beneath the weight of the dead
clayton and lieutenant charpentier brought up the rear of the column the englishman silent in respect for the other's grief for d'arnot and charpentier had been inseparable friends since boyhood
clayton could not but realize that the frenchman felt his grief the more keenly because d'arnot's sacrifice had been so futile since jane had been rescued before d'arnot had fallen into the hands of the savages and again because the service in which he had lost his life had been outside his duty and for strangers and aliens but when he spoke of it to lieutenant charpentier the latter shook his head
no monsieur he said d'arnot would have chosen to die thus
i only grieve that i could not have died for him or at least with him
i wish that you could have known him better monsieur
he was indeed an officer and a gentlemana title conferred on many but deserved by so few
he did not die futilely for his death in the cause of a strange american girl will make us his comrades face our ends the more bravely however they may come to us
clayton did not reply but within him rose a new respect for frenchmen which remained undimmed ever after
it was quite late when they reached the cabin by the beach
a single shot before they emerged from the jungle had announced to those in camp as well as on the ship that the expedition had been too latefor it had been prearranged that when they came within a mile or two of camp one shot was to be fired to denote failure or three for success while two would have indicated that they had found no sign of either d'arnot or his black captors
so it was a solemn party that awaited their coming and few words were spoken as the dead and wounded men were tenderly placed in boats and rowed silently toward the cruiser
clayton exhausted from his five days of laborious marching through the jungle and from the effects of his two battles with the blacks turned toward the cabin to seek a mouthful of food and then the comparative ease of his bed of grasses after two nights in the jungle
by the cabin door stood jane
the poor lieutenant
she asked
did you find no trace of him
we were too late miss porter he replied sadly
tell me
what had happened
she asked
i cannot miss porter it is too horrible
you do not mean that they had tortured him
she whispered
we do not know what they did to him before they killed him he answered his face drawn with fatigue and the sorrow he felt for poor d'arnot and he emphasized the word before
before they killed him
what do you mean
they are not
they are not
she was thinking of what clayton had said of the forest man's probable relationship to this tribe and she could not frame the awful word
yes miss porter they werecannibals he said almost bitterly for to him too had suddenly come the thought of the forest man and the strange unaccountable jealousy he had felt two days before swept over him once more
and then in sudden brutality that was as unlike clayton as courteous consideration is unlike an ape he blurted out  when your forest god left you he was doubtless hurrying to the feast
he was sorry ere the words were spoken though he did not know how cruelly they had cut the girl
his regret was for his baseless disloyalty to one who had saved the lives of every member of his party and offered harm to none
the girl's head went high
there could be but one suitable reply to your assertion mr clayton she said icily and i regret that i am not a man that i might make it
she turned quickly and entered the cabin
clayton was an englishman so the girl had passed quite out of sight before he deduced what reply a man would have made
upon my word he said ruefully she called me a liar
and i fancy i jolly well deserved it he added thoughtfully
clayton my boy i know you are tired out and unstrung but that's no reason why you should make an ass of yourself
you'd better go to bed
but before he did so he called gently to jane upon the opposite side of the sailcloth partition for he wished to apologize but he might as well have addressed the sphinx
then he wrote upon a piece of paper and shoved it beneath the partition
jane saw the little note and ignored it for she was very angry and hurt and mortified butshe was a woman and so eventually she picked it up and read it
my dear miss porter  i had no reason to insinuate what i did
my only excuse is that my nerves must be unstrungwhich is no excuse at all
please try and think that i did not say it
i am very sorry
i would not have hurt you above all others in the world
say that you forgive me
wm
cecil clayton
he did think it or he never would have said it reasoned the girl but it cannot be trueoh i know it is not true
one sentence in the letter frightened her  i would not have hurt you above all others in the world
a week ago that sentence would have filled her with delight now it depressed her
she wished she had never met clayton
she was sorry that she had ever seen the forest god
no she was glad
and there was that other note she had found in the grass before the cabin the day after her return from the jungle the love note signed by tarzan of the apes
who could be this new suitor
if he were another of the wild denizens of this terrible forest what might he not do to claim her
esmeralda
wake up she cried
you make me so irritable sleeping there peacefully when you know perfectly well that the world is filled with sorrow
gaberelle
screamed esmeralda sitting up
what is it now
a hipponocerous
where is he miss jane
nonsense esmeralda there is nothing
go back to sleep
you are bad enough asleep but you are infinitely worse awake
yes honey but what's the matter with you precious
you acts sort of disgranulated this evening
oh esmeralda i'm just plain ugly tonight said the girl
don't pay any attention to methat's a dear
yes honey now you go right to sleep
your nerves are all on edge
what with all these ripotamuses and man eating geniuses that mister philander been telling aboutlord it ain't no wonder we all get nervous prosecution
jane crossed the little room laughing and kissing the faithful woman bid esmeralda good night
chapter xxiii  brother men
when d'arnot regained consciousness he found himself lying upon a bed of soft ferns and grasses beneath a little a shaped shelter of boughs
at his feet an opening looked out upon a green sward and at a little distance beyond was the dense wall of jungle and forest
he was very lame and sore and weak and as full consciousness returned he felt the sharp torture of many cruel wounds and the dull aching of every bone and muscle in his body as a result of the hideous beating he had received
even the turning of his head caused him such excruciating agony that he lay still with closed eyes for a long time
he tried to piece out the details of his adventure prior to the time he lost consciousness to see if they would explain his present whereaboutshe wondered if he were among friends or foes
at length he recollected the whole hideous scene at the stake and finally recalled the strange white figure in whose arms he had sunk into oblivion
d'arnot wondered what fate lay in store for him now
he could neither see nor hear any signs of life about him
the incessant hum of the junglethe rustling of millions of leavesthe buzz of insectsthe voices of the birds and monkeys seemed blended into a strangely soothing purr as though he lay apart far from the myriad life whose sounds came to him only as a blurred echo
at length he fell into a quiet slumber nor did he awake again until afternoon
once more he experienced the strange sense of utter bewilderment that had marked his earlier awakening but soon he recalled the recent past and looking through the opening at his feet he saw the figure of a man squatting on his haunches
the broad muscular back was turned toward him but tanned though it was d'arnot saw that it was the back of a white man and he thanked god
the frenchman called faintly
the man turned and rising came toward the shelter
his face was very handsomethe handsomest thought d'arnot that he had ever seen
stooping he crawled into the shelter beside the wounded officer and placed a cool hand upon his forehead
d'arnot spoke to him in french but the man only shook his headsadly it seemed to the frenchman
then d'arnot tried english but still the man shook his head
italian spanish and german brought similar discouragement
d'arnot knew a few words of norwegian russian greek and also had a smattering of the language of one of the west coast negro tribesthe man denied them all
after examining d'arnot's wounds the man left the shelter and disappeared
in half an hour he was back with fruit and a hollow gourdlike vegetable filled with water
d'arnot drank and ate a little
he was surprised that he had no fever
again he tried to converse with his strange nurse but the attempt was useless
suddenly the man hastened from the shelter only to return a few minutes later with several pieces of bark andwonder of wondersa lead pencil
squatting beside d'arnot he wrote for a minute on the smooth inner surface of the bark then he handed it to the frenchman
d'arnot was astonished to see in plain printlike characters a message in english   i am tarzan of the apes
who are you
can you read this language
d'arnot seized the pencilthen he stopped
this strange man wrote englishevidently he was an englishman
yes said d'arnot i read english
i speak it also
now we may talk
first let me thank you for all that you have done for me
the man only shook his head and pointed to the pencil and the bark
mon dieu
cried d'arnot
if you are english why is it then that you cannot speak english
and then in a flash it came to himthe man was a mute possibly a deaf mute
so d'arnot wrote a message on the bark in english
i am paul d'arnot lieutenant in the navy of france
i thank you for what you have done for me
you have saved my life and all that i have is yours
may i ask how it is that one who writes english does not speak it
tarzan's reply filled d'arnot with still greater wonder   i speak only the language of my tribethe great apes who were kerchak's and a little of the languages of tantor the elephant and numa the lion and of the other folks of the jungle i understand
with a human being i have never spoken except once with jane porter by signs
this is the first time i have spoken with another of my kind through written words
d'arnot was mystified
it seemed incredible that there lived upon earth a fullgrown man who had never spoken with a fellow man and still more preposterous that such a one could read and write
he looked again at tarzan's messageexcept once with jane porter
that was the american girl who had been carried into the jungle by a gorilla
a sudden light commenced to dawn on d'arnotthis then was the gorilla
he seized the pencil and wrote   where is jane porter
and tarzan replied below   back with her people in the cabin of tarzan of the apes
she is not dead then
where was she
what happened to her
she is not dead
she was taken by terkoz to be his wife but tarzan of the apes took her away from terkoz and killed him before he could harm her
none in all the jungle may face tarzan of the apes in battle and live
i am tarzan of the apesmighty fighter
d'arnot wrote   i am glad she is safe
it pains me to write i will rest a while
and then tarzan   yes rest
when you are well i shall take you back to your people
for many days d'arnot lay upon his bed of soft ferns
the second day a fever had come and d'arnot thought that it meant infection and he knew that he would die
an idea came to him
he wondered why he had not thought of it before
he called tarzan and indicated by signs that he would write and when tarzan had fetched the bark and pencil d'arnot wrote   can you go to my people and lead them here
i will write a message that you may take to them and they will follow you
tarzan shook his head and taking the bark wrote   i had thought of thatthe first day but i dared not
the great apes come often to this spot and if they found you here wounded and alone they would kill you
d'arnot turned on his side and closed his eyes
he did not wish to die but he felt that he was going for the fever was mounting higher and higher
that night he lost consciousness
for three days he was in delirium and tarzan sat beside him and bathed his head and hands and washed his wounds
on the fourth day the fever broke as suddenly as it had come but it left d'arnot a shadow of his former self and very weak
tarzan had to lift him that he might drink from the gourd
the fever had not been the result of infection as d'arnot had thought but one of those that commonly attack whites in the jungles of africa and either kill or leave them as suddenly as d'arnot's had left him
two days later d'arnot was tottering about the amphitheater tarzan's strong arm about him to keep him from falling
they sat beneath the shade of a great tree and tarzan found some smooth bark that they might converse
d'arnot wrote the first message   what can i do to repay you for all that you have done for me
and tarzan in reply   teach me to speak the language of men
and so d'arnot commenced at once pointing out familiar objects and repeating their names in french for he thought that it would be easier to teach this man his own language since he understood it himself best of all
it meant nothing to tarzan of course for he could not tell one language from another so when he pointed to the word man which he had printed upon a piece of bark he learned from d'arnot that it was pronounced homme and in the same way he was taught to pronounce ape singe and tree arbre
he was a most eager student and in two more days had mastered so much french that he could speak little sentences such as  that is a tree this is grass i am hungry and the like but d'arnot found that it was difficult to teach him the french construction upon a foundation of english
the frenchman wrote little lessons for him in english and had tarzan repeat them in french but as a literal translation was usually very poor french tarzan was often confused
d'arnot realized now that he had made a mistake but it seemed too late to go back and do it all over again and force tarzan to unlearn all that he had learned especially as they were rapidly approaching a point where they would be able to converse
on the third day after the fever broke tarzan wrote a message asking d'arnot if he felt strong enough to be carried back to the cabin
tarzan was as anxious to go as d'arnot for he longed to see jane again
it had been hard for him to remain with the frenchman all these days for that very reason and that he had unselfishly done so spoke more glowingly of his nobility of character than even did his rescuing the french officer from mbonga's clutches
d'arnot only too willing to attempt the journey wrote   but you cannot carry me all the distance through this tangled forest
tarzan laughed
mais oui he said and d'arnot laughed aloud to hear the phrase that he used so often glide from tarzan's tongue
so they set out d'arnot marveling as had clayton and jane at the wondrous strength and agility of the apeman
midafternoon brought them to the clearing and as tarzan dropped to earth from the branches of the last tree his heart leaped and bounded against his ribs in anticipation of seeing jane so soon again
no one was in sight outside the cabin and d'arnot was perplexed to note that neither the cruiser nor the arrow was at anchor in the bay
an atmosphere of loneliness pervaded the spot which caught suddenly at both men as they strode toward the cabin
neither spoke yet both knew before they opened the closed door what they would find beyond
tarzan lifted the latch and pushed the great door in upon its wooden hinges
it was as they had feared
the cabin was deserted
the men turned and looked at one another
d'arnot knew that his people thought him dead but tarzan thought only of the woman who had kissed him in love and now had fled from him while he was serving one of her people
a great bitterness rose in his heart
he would go away far into the jungle and join his tribe
never would he see one of his own kind again nor could he bear the thought of returning to the cabin
he would leave that forever behind him with the great hopes he had nursed there of finding his own race and becoming a man among men
and the frenchman
d'arnot
what of him
he could get along as tarzan had
tarzan did not want to see him more
he wanted to get away from everything that might remind him of jane
as tarzan stood upon the threshold brooding d'arnot had entered the cabin
many comforts he saw that had been left behind
he recognized numerous articles from the cruisera camp oven some kitchen utensils a rifle and many rounds of ammunition canned foods blankets two chairs and a cotand several books and periodicals mostly american
they must intend returning thought d'arnot
he walked over to the table that john clayton had built so many years before to serve as a desk and on it he saw two notes addressed to tarzan of the apes
one was in a strong masculine hand and was unsealed
the other in a woman's hand was sealed
here are two messages for you tarzan of the apes cried d'arnot turning toward the door but his companion was not there
d'arnot walked to the door and looked out
tarzan was nowhere in sight
he called aloud but there was no response
mon dieu
exclaimed d'arnot he has left me
i feel it
he has gone back into his jungle and left me here alone
and then he remembered the look on tarzan's face when they had discovered that the cabin was emptysuch a look as the hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has wantonly brought down
the man had been hard hitd'arnot realized it nowbut why
he could not understand
the frenchman looked about him
the loneliness and the horror of the place commenced to get on his nervesalready weakened by the ordeal of suffering and sickness he had passed through
to be left here alone beside this awful junglenever to hear a human voice or see a human facein constant dread of savage beasts and more terribly savage mena prey to solitude and hopelessness
it was awful
and far to the east tarzan of the apes was speeding through the middle terrace back to his tribe
never had he traveled with such reckless speed
he felt that he was running away from himselfthat by hurtling through the forest like a frightened squirrel he was escaping from his own thoughts
but no matter how fast he went he found them always with him
he passed above the sinuous body of sabor the lioness going in the opposite directiontoward the cabin thought tarzan
what could d'arnot do against saboror if bolgani the gorilla should come upon himor numa the lion or cruel sheeta
tarzan paused in his flight
what are you tarzan
he asked aloud
an ape or a man
if you are an ape you will do as the apes would doleave one of your kind to die in the jungle if it suited your whim to go elsewhere
if you are a man you will return to protect your kind
you will not run away from one of your own people because one of them has run away from you
d'arnot closed the cabin door
he was very nervous
even brave men and d'arnot was a brave man are sometimes frightened by solitude
he loaded one of the rifles and placed it within easy reach
then he went to the desk and took up the unsealed letter addressed to tarzan
possibly it contained word that his people had but left the beach temporarily
he felt that it would be no breach of ethics to read this letter so he took the enclosure from the envelope and read  to tarzan of the apes   we thank you for the use of your cabin and are sorry that you did not permit us the pleasure of seeing and thanking you in person
we have harmed nothing but have left many things for you which may add to your comfort and safety here in your lonely home
if you know the strange white man who saved our lives so many times and brought us food and if you can converse with him thank him also for his kindness
we sail within the hour never to return but we wish you and that other jungle friend to know that we shall always thank you for what you did for strangers on your shore and that we should have done infinitely more to reward you both had you given us the opportunity
very respectfully               wm
cecil clayton
'never to return' muttered d'arnot and threw himself face downward upon the cot
an hour later he started up listening
something was at the door trying to enter
d'arnot reached for the loaded rifle and placed it to his shoulder
dusk was falling and the interior of the cabin was very dark but the man could see the latch moving from its place
he felt his hair rising upon his scalp
gently the door opened until a thin crack showed something standing just beyond
d'arnot sighted along the blue barrel at the crack of the doorand then he pulled the trigger
chapter xxiv  lost treasure   when the expedition returned following their fruitless endeavor to succor d'arnot captain dufranne was anxious to steam away as quickly as possible and all save jane had acquiesced
no she said determinedly i shall not go nor should you for there are two friends in that jungle who will come out of it some day expecting to find us awaiting them
your officer captain dufranne is one of them and the forest man who has saved the lives of every member of my father's party is the other
he left me at the edge of the jungle two days ago to hasten to the aid of my father and mr clayton as he thought and he has stayed to rescue lieutenant d'arnot of that you may be sure
had he been too late to be of service to the lieutenant he would have been back before nowthe fact that he is not back is sufficient proof to me that he is delayed because lieutenant d'arnot is wounded or he has had to follow his captors further than the village which your sailors attacked
but poor d'arnot's uniform and all his belongings were found in that village miss porter argued the captain and the natives showed great excitement when questioned as to the white man's fate
yes captain but they did not admit that he was dead and as for his clothes and accouterments being in their possessionwhy more civilized peoples than these poor savage negroes strip their prisoners of every article of value whether they intend killing them or not
even the soldiers of my own dear south looted not only the living but the dead
it is strong circumstantial evidence i will admit but it is not positive proof
possibly your forest man himself was captured or killed by the savages suggested captain dufranne
the girl laughed
you do not know him she replied a little thrill of pride setting her nerves atingle at the thought that she spoke of her own
i admit that he would be worth waiting for this superman of yours laughed the captain
i most certainly should like to see him
then wait for him my dear captain urged the girl for i intend doing so
the frenchman would have been a very much surprised man could he have interpreted the true meaning of the girl's words
they had been walking from the beach toward the cabin as they talked and now they joined a little group sitting on camp stools in the shade of a great tree beside the cabin
professor porter was there and mr philander and clayton with lieutenant charpentier and two of his brother officers while esmeralda hovered in the background ever and anon venturing opinions and comments with the freedom of an old and muchindulged family servant
the officers arose and saluted as their superior approached and clayton surrendered his camp stool to jane
we were just discussing poor paul's fate said captain dufranne
miss porter insists that we have no absolute proof of his deathnor have we
and on the other hand she maintains that the continued absence of your omnipotent jungle friend indicates that d'arnot is still in need of his services either because he is wounded or still is a prisoner in a more distant native village
it has been suggested ventured lieutenant charpentier that the wild man may have been a member of the tribe of blacks who attacked our partythat he was hastening to aid themhis own people
jane shot a quick glance at clayton
it seems vastly more reasonable said professor porter
i do not agree with you objected mr philander
he had ample opportunity to harm us himself or to lead his people against us
instead during our long residence here he has been uniformly consistent in his role of protector and provider
that is true interjected clayton yet we must not overlook the fact that except for himself the only human beings within hundreds of miles are savage cannibals
he was armed precisely as are they which indicates that he has maintained relations of some nature with them and the fact that he is but one against possibly thousands suggests that these relations could scarcely have been other than friendly
it seems improbable then that he is not connected with them remarked the captain possibly a member of this tribe
otherwise added another of the officers how could he have lived a sufficient length of time among the savage denizens of the jungle brute and human to have become proficient in woodcraft or in the use of african weapons
you are judging him according to your own standards gentlemen said jane
an ordinary white man such as any of youpardon me i did not mean just thatrather a white man above the ordinary in physique and intelligence could never i grant you have lived a year alone and naked in this tropical jungle but this man not only surpasses the average white man in strength and agility but as far transcends our trained athletes and 'strong men' as they surpass a dayold babe and his courage and ferocity in battle are those of the wild beast
he has certainly won a loyal champion miss porter said captain dufranne laughing
i am sure that there be none of us here but would willingly face death a hundred times in its most terrifying forms to deserve the tributes of one even half so loyalor so beautiful
you would not wonder that i defend him said the girl could you have seen him as i saw him battling in my behalf with that huge hairy brute
could you have seen him charge the monster as a bull might charge a grizzlyabsolutely without sign of fear or hesitationyou would have believed him more than human
could you have seen those mighty muscles knotting under the brown skincould you have seen them force back those awful fangsyou too would have thought him invincible
and could you have seen the chivalrous treatment which he accorded a strange girl of a strange race you would feel the same absolute confidence in him that i feel
you have won your suit my fair pleader cried the captain
this court finds the defendant not guilty and the cruiser shall wait a few days longer that he may have an opportunity to come and thank the divine portia
for the lord's sake honey cried esmeralda
you all don't mean to tell me that you're going to stay right here in this here land of carnivable animals when you all got the opportunity to escapade on that boat
don't you tell me that honey
why esmeralda
you should be ashamed of yourself cried jane
is this any way to show your gratitude to the man who saved your life twice
well miss jane that's all jest as you say but that there forest man never did save us to stay here
he done save us so we all could get away from here
i expect he be mighty peevish when he find we ain't got no more sense than to stay right here after he done give us the chance to get away
i hoped i'd never have to sleep in this here geological garden another night and listen to all them lonesome noises that come out of that jumble after dark
i don't blame you a bit esmeralda said clayton and you certainly did hit it off right when you called them 'lonesome' noises
i never have been able to find the right word for them but that's it don't you know lonesome noises
you and esmeralda had better go and live on the cruiser said jane in fine scorn
what would you think if you had to live all of your life in that jungle as our forest man has done
i'm afraid i'd be a blooming bounder as a wild man laughed clayton ruefully
those noises at night make the hair on my head bristle
i suppose that i should be ashamed to admit it but it's the truth
i don't know about that said lieutenant charpentier
i never thought much about fear and that sort of thingnever tried to determine whether i was a coward or brave man but the other night as we lay in the jungle there after poor d'arnot was taken and those jungle noises rose and fell around us i began to think that i was a coward indeed
it was not the roaring and growling of the big beasts that affected me so much as it was the stealthy noisesthe ones that you heard suddenly close by and then listened vainly for a repetition ofthe unaccountable sounds as of a great body moving almost noiselessly and the knowledge that you didn't know how close it was or whether it were creeping closer after you ceased to hear it
it was those noisesand the eyes
mon dieu
i shall see them in the dark foreverthe eyes that you see and those that you don't see but feelah they are the worst
all were silent for a moment and then jane spoke
and he is out there she said in an awehushed whisper
those eyes will be glaring at him tonight and at your comrade lieutenant d'arnot
can you leave them gentlemen without at least rendering them the passive succor which remaining here a few days longer might insure them
tut tut child said professor porter
captain dufranne is willing to remain and for my part i am perfectly willing perfectly willingas i always have been to humor your childish whims
we can utilize the morrow in recovering the chest professor suggested mr philander
quite so quite so mr philander i had almost forgotten the treasure exclaimed professor porter
possibly we can borrow some men from captain dufranne to assist us and one of the prisoners to point out the location of the chest
most assuredly my dear professor we are all yours to command said the captain
and so it was arranged that on the next day lieutenant charpentier was to take a detail of ten men and one of the mutineers of the arrow as a guide and unearth the treasure and that the cruiser would remain for a full week in the little harbor
at the end of that time it was to be assumed that d'arnot was truly dead and that the forest man would not return while they remained
then the two vessels were to leave with all the party
professor porter did not accompany the treasureseekers on the following day but when he saw them returning emptyhanded toward noon he hastened forward to meet themhis usual preoccupied indifference entirely vanished and in its place a nervous and excited manner
where is the treasure
he cried to clayton while yet a hundred feet separated them
clayton shook his head
gone he said as he neared the professor
gone
it cannot be
who could have taken it
cried professor porter
god only knows professor replied clayton
we might have thought the fellow who guided us was lying about the location but his surprise and consternation on finding no chest beneath the body of the murdered snipes were too real to be feigned
and then our spades showed us that something had been buried beneath the corpse for a hole had been there and it had been filled with loose earth
but who could have taken it
repeated professor porter
suspicion might naturally fall on the men of the cruiser said lieutenant charpentier but for the fact that sublieutenant janviers here assures me that no men have had shore leavethat none has been on shore since we anchored here except under command of an officer
i do not know that you would suspect our men but i am glad that there is now no chance for suspicion to fall on them he concluded
it would never have occurred to me to suspect the men to whom we owe so much replied professor porter graciously
i would as soon suspect my dear clayton here or mr
philander
the frenchmen smiled both officers and sailors
it was plain to see that a burden had been lifted from their minds
the treasure has been gone for some time continued clayton
in fact the body fell apart as we lifted it which indicates that whoever removed the treasure did so while the corpse was still fresh for it was intact when we first uncovered it
there must have been several in the party said jane who had joined them
you remember that it took four men to carry it
by jove
cried clayton
that's right
it must have been done by a party of blacks
probably one of them saw the men bury the chest and then returned immediately after with a party of his friends and carried it off
speculation is futile said professor porter sadly
the chest is gone
we shall never see it again nor the treasure that was in it
only jane knew what the loss meant to her father and none there knew what it meant to her
six days later captain dufranne announced that they would sail early on the morrow
jane would have begged for a further reprieve had it not been that she too had begun to believe that her forest lover would return no more
in spite of herself she began to entertain doubts and fears
the reasonableness of the arguments of these disinterested french officers commenced to convince her against her will
that he was a cannibal she would not believe but that he was an adopted member of some savage tribe at length seemed possible to her
she would not admit that he could be dead
it was impossible to believe that that perfect body so filled with triumphant life could ever cease to harbor the vital sparkas soon believe that immortality were dust
as jane permitted herself to harbor these thoughts others equally unwelcome forced themselves upon her
if he belonged to some savage tribe he had a savage wifea dozen of them perhapsand wild halfcaste children
the girl shuddered and when they told her that the cruiser would sail on the morrow she was almost glad
it was she though who suggested that arms ammunition supplies and comforts be left behind in the cabin ostensibly for that intangible personality who had signed himself tarzan of the apes and for d'arnot should he still be living but really she hoped for her forest godeven though his feet should prove of clay
and at the last minute she left a message for him to be transmitted by tarzan of the apes
she was the last to leave the cabin returning on some trivial pretext after the others had started for the boat
she kneeled down beside the bed in which she had spent so many nights and offered up a prayer for the safety of her primeval man and crushing his locket to her lips she murmured  i love you and because i love you i believe in you
but if i did not believe still should i love
had you come back for me and had there been no other way i would have gone into the jungle with youforever
chapter xxv  the outpost of the world   with the report of his gun d'arnot saw the door fly open and the figure of a man pitch headlong within onto the cabin floor
the frenchman in his panic raised his gun to fire again into the prostrate form but suddenly in the half dusk of the open door he saw that the man was white and in another instant realized that he had shot his friend and protector tarzan of the apes
with a cry of anguish d'arnot sprang to the apeman's side and kneeling lifted the latter's head in his armscalling tarzan's name aloud
there was no response and then d'arnot placed his ear above the man's heart
to his joy he heard its steady beating beneath
carefully he lifted tarzan to the cot and then after closing and bolting the door he lighted one of the lamps and examined the wound
the bullet had struck a glancing blow upon the skull
there was an ugly flesh wound but no signs of a fracture of the skull
d'arnot breathed a sigh of relief and went about bathing the blood from tarzan's face
soon the cool water revived him and presently he opened his eyes to look in questioning surprise at d'arnot
the latter had bound the wound with pieces of cloth and as he saw that tarzan had regained consciousness he arose and going to the table wrote a message which he handed to the apeman explaining the terrible mistake he had made and how thankful he was that the wound was not more serious
tarzan after reading the message sat on the edge of the couch and laughed
it is nothing he said in french and then his vocabulary failing him he wrote  you should have seen what bolgani did to me and kerchak and terkoz before i killed themthen you would laugh at such a little scratch
d'arnot handed tarzan the two messages that had been left for him
tarzan read the first one through with a look of sorrow on his face
the second one he turned over and over searching for an openinghe had never seen a sealed envelope before
at length he handed it to d'arnot
the frenchman had been watching him and knew that tarzan was puzzled over the envelope
how strange it seemed that to a fullgrown white man an envelope was a mystery
d'arnot opened it and handed the letter back to tarzan
sitting on a camp stool the apeman spread the written sheet before him and read  to tarzan of the apes  before i leave let me add my thanks to those of mr clayton for the kindness you have shown in permitting us the use of your cabin
that you never came to make friends with us has been a great regret to us
we should have liked so much to have seen and thanked our host
there is another i should like to thank also but he did not come back though i cannot believe that he is dead
i do not know his name
he is the great white giant who wore the diamond locket upon his breast
if you know him and can speak his language carry my thanks to him and tell him that i waited seven days for him to return
tell him also that in my home in america in the city of baltimore there will always be a welcome for him if he cares to come
i found a note you wrote me lying among the leaves beneath a tree near the cabin
i do not know how you learned to love me who have never spoken to me and i am very sorry if it is true for i have already given my heart to another
but know that i am always your friend                                   jane porter
tarzan sat with gaze fixed upon the floor for nearly an hour
it was evident to him from the notes that they did not know that he and tarzan of the apes were one and the same
i have given my heart to another he repeated over and over again to himself
then she did not love him
how could she have pretended love and raised him to such a pinnacle of hope only to cast him down to such utter depths of despair
maybe her kisses were only signs of friendship
how did he know who knew nothing of the customs of human beings
suddenly he arose and bidding d'arnot good night as he had learned to do threw himself upon the couch of ferns that had been jane porter's
d'arnot extinguished the lamp and lay down upon the cot
for a week they did little but rest d'arnot coaching tarzan in french
at the end of that time the two men could converse quite easily
one night as they were sitting within the cabin before retiring tarzan turned to d'arnot
where is america
he said
d'arnot pointed toward the northwest
many thousands of miles across the ocean he replied
why
i am going there
d'arnot shook his head
it is impossible my friend he said
tarzan rose and going to one of the cupboards returned with a wellthumbed geography
turning to a map of the world he said  i have never quite understood all this explain it to me please
when d'arnot had done so showing him that the blue represented all the water on the earth and the bits of other colors the continents and islands tarzan asked him to point out the spot where they now were
d'arnot did so
now point out america said tarzan
and as d'arnot placed his finger upon north america tarzan smiled and laid his palm upon the page spanning the great ocean that lay between the two continents
you see it is not so very far he said scarce the width of my hand
d'arnot laughed
how could he make the man understand
then he took a pencil and made a tiny point upon the shore of africa
this little mark he said is many times larger upon this map than your cabin is upon the earth
do you see now how very far it is
tarzan thought for a long time
do any white men live in africa
he asked
yes
where are the nearest
d'arnot pointed out a spot on the shore just north of them
so close
asked tarzan in surprise
yes said d'arnot but it is not close
have they big boats to cross the ocean
yes
we shall go there tomorrow announced tarzan
again d'arnot smiled and shook his head
it is too far
we should die long before we reached them
do you wish to stay here then forever
asked tarzan
no said d'arnot
then we shall start tomorrow
i do not like it here longer
i should rather die than remain here
well answered d'arnot with a shrug i do not know my friend but that i also would rather die than remain here
if you go i shall go with you
it is settled then said tarzan
i shall start for america tomorrow
how will you get to america without money
asked d'arnot
what is money
inquired tarzan
it took a long time to make him understand even imperfectly
how do men get money
he asked at last
they work for it
very well
i will work for it then
no my friend returned d'arnot you need not worry about money nor need you work for it
i have enough money for twoenough for twenty
much more than is good for one man and you shall have all you need if ever we reach civilization
so on the following day they started north along the shore
each man carrying a rifle and ammunition beside bedding and some food and cooking utensils
the latter seemed to tarzan a most useless encumbrance so he threw his away
but you must learn to eat cooked food my friend remonstrated d'arnot
no civilized men eat raw flesh
there will be time enough when i reach civilization said tarzan
i do not like the things and they only spoil the taste of good meat
for a month they traveled north
sometimes finding food in plenty and again going hungry for days
they saw no signs of natives nor were they molested by wild beasts
their journey was a miracle of ease
tarzan asked questions and learned rapidly
d'arnot taught him many of the refinements of civilizationeven to the use of knife and fork but sometimes tarzan would drop them in disgust and grasp his food in his strong brown hands tearing it with his molars like a wild beast
then d'arnot would expostulate with him saying  you must not eat like a brute tarzan while i am trying to make a gentleman of you
mon dieu
gentlemen do not thusit is terrible
tarzan would grin sheepishly and pick up his knife and fork again but at heart he hated them
on the journey he told d'arnot about the great chest he had seen the sailors bury of how he had dug it up and carried it to the gathering place of the apes and buried it there
it must be the treasure chest of professor porter said d'arnot
it is too bad but of course you did not know
then tarzan recalled the letter written by jane to her friendthe one he had stolen when they first came to his cabin and now he knew what was in the chest and what it meant to jane
tomorrow we shall go back after it he announced to d'arnot
go back
exclaimed d'arnot
but my dear fellow we have now been three weeks upon the march
it would require three more to return to the treasure and then with that enormous weight which required you say four sailors to carry it would be months before we had again reached this spot
it must be done my friend insisted tarzan
you may go on toward civilization and i will return for the treasure
i can go very much faster alone
i have a better plan tarzan exclaimed d'arnot
we shall go on together to the nearest settlement and there we will charter a boat and sail back down the coast for the treasure and so transport it easily
that will be safer and quicker and also not require us to be separated
what do you think of that plan
very well said tarzan
the treasure will be there whenever we go for it and while i could fetch it now and catch up with you in a moon or two i shall feel safer for you to know that you are not alone on the trail
when i see how helpless you are d'arnot i often wonder how the human race has escaped annihilation all these ages which you tell me about
why sabor single handed could exterminate a thousand of you
d'arnot laughed
you will think more highly of your genus when you have seen its armies and navies its great cities and its mighty engineering works
then you will realize that it is mind and not muscle that makes the human animal greater than the mighty beasts of your jungle
alone and unarmed a single man is no match for any of the larger beasts but if ten men were together they would combine their wits and their muscles against their savage enemies while the beasts being unable to reason would never think of combining against the men
otherwise tarzan of the apes how long would you have lasted in the savage wilderness
you are right d'arnot replied tarzan for if kerchak had come to tublat's aid that night at the dumdum there would have been an end of me
but kerchak could never think far enough ahead to take advantage of any such opportunity
even kala my mother could never plan ahead
she simply ate what she needed when she needed it and if the supply was very scarce even though she found plenty for several meals she would never gather any ahead
i remember that she used to think it very silly of me to burden myself with extra food upon the march though she was quite glad to eat it with me if the way chanced to be barren of sustenance
then you knew your mother tarzan
asked d'arnot in surprise
yes
she was a great fine ape larger than i and weighing twice as much
and your father
asked d'arnot
i did not know him
kala told me he was a white ape and hairless like myself
i know now that he must have been a white man
d'arnot looked long and earnestly at his companion
tarzan he said at length it is impossible that the ape kala was your mother
if such a thing can be which i doubt you would have inherited some of the characteristics of the ape but you have notyou are pure man and i should say the offspring of highly bred and intelligent parents
have you not the slightest clue to your past
not the slightest replied tarzan
no writings in the cabin that might have told something of the lives of its original inmates
i have read everything that was in the cabin with the exception of one book which i know now to be written in a language other than english
possibly you can read it
tarzan fished the little black diary from the bottom of his quiver and handed it to his companion
d'arnot glanced at the title page
it is the diary of john clayton lord greystoke an english nobleman and it is written in french he said
then he proceeded to read the diary that had been written over twenty years before and which recorded the details of the story which we already knowthe story of adventure hardships and sorrow of john clayton and his wife alice from the day they left england until an hour before he was struck down by kerchak
d'arnot read aloud
at times his voice broke and he was forced to stop reading for the pitiful hopelessness that spoke between the lines
occasionally he glanced at tarzan but the apeman sat upon his haunches like a carven image his eyes fixed upon the ground
only when the little babe was mentioned did the tone of the diary alter from the habitual note of despair which had crept into it by degrees after the first two months upon the shore
then the passages were tinged with a subdued happiness that was even sadder than the rest
one entry showed an almost hopeful spirit
today our little boy is six months old
he is sitting in alice's lap beside the table where i am writinga happy healthy perfect child
somehow even against all reason i seem to see him a grown man taking his father's place in the worldthe second john claytonand bringing added honors to the house of greystoke
thereas though to give my prophecy the weight of his endorsementhe has grabbed my pen in his chubby fists and with his inkbegrimed little fingers has placed the seal of his tiny finger prints upon the page
and there on the margin of the page were the partially blurred imprints of four wee fingers and the outer half of the thumb
when d'arnot had finished the diary the two men sat in silence for some minutes
well
tarzan of the apes what think you
asked d'arnot
does not this little book clear up the mystery of your parentage
why man you are lord greystoke
the book speaks of but one child he replied
its little skeleton lay in the crib where it died crying for nourishment from the first time i entered the cabin until professor porter's party buried it with its father and mother beside the cabin
no that was the babe the book speaks ofand the mystery of my origin is deeper than before for i have thought much of late of the possibility of that cabin having been my birthplace
i am afraid that kala spoke the truth he concluded sadly
d'arnot shook his head
he was unconvinced and in his mind had sprung the determination to prove the correctness of his theory for he had discovered the key which alone could unlock the mystery or consign it forever to the realms of the unfathomable
a week later the two men came suddenly upon a clearing in the forest
in the distance were several buildings surrounded by a strong palisade
between them and the enclosure stretched a cultivated field in which a number of negroes were working
the two halted at the edge of the jungle
tarzan fitted his bow with a poisoned arrow but d'arnot placed a hand upon his arm
what would you do tarzan
he asked
they will try to kill us if they see us replied tarzan
i prefer to be the killer
maybe they are friends suggested d'arnot
they are black was tarzan's only reply
and again he drew back his shaft
you must not tarzan
cried d'arnot
white men do not kill wantonly
mon dieu
but you have much to learn
i pity the ruffian who crosses you my wild man when i take you to paris
i will have my hands full keeping your neck from beneath the guillotine
tarzan lowered his bow and smiled
i do not know why i should kill the blacks back there in my jungle yet not kill them here
suppose numa the lion should spring out upon us i should say then i presume good morning monsieur numa how is madame numa eh
wait until the blacks spring upon you replied d'arnot then you may kill them
do not assume that men are your enemies until they prove it
come said tarzan let us go and present ourselves to be killed and he started straight across the field his head high held and the tropical sun beating upon his smooth brown skin
behind him came d'arnot clothed in some garments which had been discarded at the cabin by clayton when the officers of the french cruiser had fitted him out in more presentable fashion
presently one of the blacks looked up and beholding tarzan turned shrieking toward the palisade
in an instant the air was filled with cries of terror from the fleeing gardeners but before any had reached the palisade a white man emerged from the enclosure rifle in hand to discover the cause of the commotion
what he saw brought his rifle to his shoulder and tarzan of the apes would have felt cold lead once again had not d'arnot cried loudly to the man with the leveled gun  do not fire
we are friends
halt then
was the reply
stop tarzan
cried d'arnot
he thinks we are enemies
tarzan dropped into a walk and together he and d'arnot advanced toward the white man by the gate
the latter eyed them in puzzled bewilderment
what manner of men are you
he asked in french
white men replied d'arnot
we have been lost in the jungle for a long time
the man had lowered his rifle and now advanced with outstretched hand
i am father constantine of the french mission here he said and i am glad to welcome you
this is monsieur tarzan father constantine replied d'arnot indicating the apeman and as the priest extended his hand to tarzan d'arnot added and i am paul d'arnot of the french navy
father constantine took the hand which tarzan extended in imitation of the priest's act while the latter took in the superb physique and handsome face in one quick keen glance
and thus came tarzan of the apes to the first outpost of civilization
for a week they remained there and the apeman keenly observant learned much of the ways of men meanwhile black women sewed white duck garments for himself and d'arnot so that they might continue their journey properly clothed
chapter xxvi  the height of civilization   another month brought them to a little group of buildings at the mouth of a wide river and there tarzan saw many boats and was filled with the timidity of the wild thing by the sight of many men
gradually he became accustomed to the strange noises and the odd ways of civilization so that presently none might know that two short months before this handsome frenchman in immaculate white ducks who laughed and chatted with the gayest of them had been swinging naked through primeval forests to pounce upon some unwary victim which raw was to fill his savage belly
the knife and fork so contemptuously flung aside a month before tarzan now manipulated as exquisitely as did the polished d'arnot
so apt a pupil had he been that the young frenchman had labored assiduously to make of tarzan of the apes a polished gentleman in so far as nicety of manners and speech were concerned
god made you a gentleman at heart my friend d'arnot had said but we want his works to show upon the exterior also
as soon as they had reached the little port d'arnot had cabled his government of his safety and requested a threemonths' leave which had been granted
he had also cabled his bankers for funds and the enforced wait of a month under which both chafed was due to their inability to charter a vessel for the return to tarzan's jungle after the treasure
during their stay at the coast town monsieur tarzan became the wonder of both whites and blacks because of several occurrences which to tarzan seemed the merest of nothings
once a huge black crazed by drink had run amuck and terrorized the town until his evil star had led him to where the blackhaired french giant lolled upon the veranda of the hotel
mounting the broad steps with brandished knife the negro made straight for a party of four men sitting at a table sipping the inevitable absinthe
shouting in alarm the four took to their heels and then the black spied tarzan
with a roar he charged the apeman while half a hundred heads peered from sheltering windows and doorways to witness the butchering of the poor frenchman by the giant black
tarzan met the rush with the fighting smile that the joy of battle always brought to his lips
as the negro closed upon him steel muscles gripped the black wrist of the uplifted knifehand and a single swift wrench left the hand dangling below a broken bone
with the pain and surprise the madness left the black man and as tarzan dropped back into his chair the fellow turned crying with agony and dashed wildly toward the native village
on another occasion as tarzan and d'arnot sat at dinner with a number of other whites the talk fell upon lions and lion hunting
opinion was divided as to the bravery of the king of beastssome maintaining that he was an arrant coward but all agreeing that it was with a feeling of greater security that they gripped their express rifles when the monarch of the jungle roared about a camp at night
d'arnot and tarzan had agreed that his past be kept secret and so none other than the french officer knew of the apeman's familiarity with the beasts of the jungle
monsieur tarzan has not expressed himself said one of the party
a man of his prowess who has spent some time in africa as i understand monsieur tarzan has must have had experiences with lionsyes
some replied tarzan dryly
enough to know that each of you are right in your judgment of the characteristics of the lionsyou have met
but one might as well judge all blacks by the fellow who ran amuck last week or decide that all whites are cowards because one has met a cowardly white
there is as much individuality among the lower orders gentlemen as there is among ourselves
today we may go out and stumble upon a lion which is overtimidhe runs away from us
tomorrow we may meet his uncle or his twin brother and our friends wonder why we do not return from the jungle
for myself i always assume that a lion is ferocious and so i am never caught off my guard
there would be little pleasure in hunting retorted the first speaker if one is afraid of the thing he hunts
d'arnot smiled
tarzan afraid
i do not exactly understand what you mean by fear said tarzan
like lions fear is a different thing in different men but to me the only pleasure in the hunt is the knowledge that the hunted thing has power to harm me as much as i have to harm him
if i went out with a couple of rifles and a gun bearer and twenty or thirty beaters to hunt a lion i should not feel that the lion had much chance and so the pleasure of the hunt would be lessened in proportion to the increased safety which i felt
then i am to take it that monsieur tarzan would prefer to go naked into the jungle armed only with a jackknife to kill the king of beasts laughed the other good naturedly but with the merest touch of sarcasm in his tone
and a piece of rope added tarzan
just then the deep roar of a lion sounded from the distant jungle as though to challenge whoever dared enter the lists with him
there is your opportunity monsieur tarzan bantered the frenchman
i am not hungry said tarzan simply
the men laughed all but d'arnot
he alone knew that a savage beast had spoken its simple reason through the lips of the apeman
but you are afraid just as any of us would be to go out there naked armed only with a knife and a piece of rope said the banterer
is it not so
no replied tarzan
only a fool performs any act without reason
five thousand francs is a reason said the other
i wager you that amount you cannot bring back a lion from the jungle under the conditions we have namednaked and armed only with a knife and a piece of rope
tarzan glanced toward d'arnot and nodded his head
make it ten thousand said d'arnot
done replied the other
tarzan arose
i shall have to leave my clothes at the edge of the settlement so that if i do not return before daylight i shall have something to wear through the streets
you are not going now exclaimed the wagererat night
why not
asked tarzan
numa walks abroad at nightit will be easier to find him
no said the other i do not want your blood upon my hands
it will be foolhardy enough if you go forth by day
i shall go now replied tarzan and went to his room for his knife and rope
the men accompanied him to the edge of the jungle where he left his clothes in a small storehouse
but when he would have entered the blackness of the undergrowth they tried to dissuade him and the wagerer was most insistent of all that he abandon his foolhardy venture
i will accede that you have won he said and the ten thousand francs are yours if you will but give up this foolish attempt which can only end in your death
tarzan laughed and in another moment the jungle had swallowed him
the men stood silent for some moments and then slowly turned and walked back to the hotel veranda
tarzan had no sooner entered the jungle than he took to the trees and it was with a feeling of exultant freedom that he swung once more through the forest branches
this was life
ah how he loved it
civilization held nothing like this in its narrow and circumscribed sphere hemmed in by restrictions and conventionalities
even clothes were a hindrance and a nuisance
at last he was free
he had not realized what a prisoner he had been
how easy it would be to circle back to the coast and then make toward the south and his own jungle and cabin
now he caught the scent of numa for he was traveling up wind
presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge furclad body through the undergrowth
tarzan came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight
then the quick noose settled and tightened about the tawny throat and as he had done it a hundred times in the past tarzan made fast the end to a strong branch and while the beast fought and clawed for freedom dropped to the ground behind him and leaping upon the great back plunged his long thin blade a dozen times into the fierce heart
then with his foot upon the carcass of numa he raised his voice in the awesome victory cry of his savage tribe
for a moment tarzan stood irresolute swayed by conflicting emotions of loyalty to d'arnot and a mighty lust for the freedom of his own jungle
at last the vision of a beautiful face and the memory of warm lips crushed to his dissolved the fascinating picture he had been drawing of his old life
the apeman threw the warm carcass of numa across his shoulders and took to the trees once more
the men upon the veranda had sat for an hour almost in silence
they had tried ineffectually to converse on various subjects and always the thing uppermost in the mind of each had caused the conversation to lapse
mon dieu said the wagerer at length i can endure it no longer
i am going into the jungle with my express and bring back that mad man
i will go with you said one
and iand iand i chorused the others
as though the suggestion had broken the spell of some horrid nightmare they hastened to their various quarters and presently were headed toward the jungleeach one heavily armed
god
what was that
suddenly cried one of the party an englishman as tarzan's savage cry came faintly to their ears
i heard the same thing once before said a belgian when i was in the gorilla country
my carriers said it was the cry of a great bull ape who has made a kill
d'arnot remembered clayton's description of the awful roar with which tarzan had announced his kills and he half smiled in spite of the horror which filled him to think that the uncanny sound could have issued from a human throatfrom the lips of his friend
as the party stood finally near the edge of the jungle debating as to the best distribution of their forces they were startled by a low laugh near them and turning beheld advancing toward them a giant figure bearing a dead lion upon its broad shoulders
even d'arnot was thunderstruck for it seemed impossible that the man could have so quickly dispatched a lion with the pitiful weapons he had taken or that alone he could have borne the huge carcass through the tangled jungle
the men crowded about tarzan with many questions but his only answer was a laughing depreciation of his feat
to tarzan it was as though one should eulogize a butcher for his heroism in killing a cow for tarzan had killed so often for food and for selfpreservation that the act seemed anything but remarkable to him
but he was indeed a hero in the eyes of these menmen accustomed to hunting big game
incidentally he had won ten thousand francs for d'arnot insisted that he keep it all
this was a very important item to tarzan who was just commencing to realize the power which lay beyond the little pieces of metal and paper which always changed hands when human beings rode or ate or slept or clothed themselves or drank or worked or played or sheltered themselves from the rain or cold or sun
it had become evident to tarzan that without money one must die
d'arnot had told him not to worry since he had more than enough for both but the apeman was learning many things and one of them was that people looked down upon one who accepted money from another without giving something of equal value in exchange
shortly after the episode of the lion hunt d'arnot succeeded in chartering an ancient tub for the coastwise trip to tarzan's landlocked harbor
it was a happy morning for them both when the little vessel weighed anchor and made for the open sea
the trip to the beach was uneventful and the morning after they dropped anchor before the cabin tarzan garbed once more in his jungle regalia and carrying a spade set out alone for the amphitheater of the apes where lay the treasure
late the next day he returned bearing the great chest upon his shoulder and at sunrise the little vessel worked through the harbor's mouth and took up her northward journey
three weeks later tarzan and d'arnot were passengers on board a french steamer bound for lyons and after a few days in that city d'arnot took tarzan to paris
the apeman was anxious to proceed to america but d'arnot insisted that he must accompany him to paris first nor would he divulge the nature of the urgent necessity upon which he based his demand
one of the first things which d'arnot accomplished after their arrival was to arrange to visit a high official of the police department an old friend and to take tarzan with him
adroitly d'arnot led the conversation from point to point until the policeman had explained to the interested tarzan many of the methods in vogue for apprehending and identifying criminals
not the least interesting to tarzan was the part played by finger prints in this fascinating science
but of what value are these imprints asked tarzan when after a few years the lines upon the fingers are entirely changed by the wearing out of the old tissue and the growth of new
the lines never change replied the official
from infancy to senility the fingerprints of an individual change only in size except as injuries alter the loops and whorls
but if imprints have been taken of the thumb and four fingers of both hands one must needs lose all entirely to escape identification
it is marvelous exclaimed d'arnot
i wonder what the lines upon my own fingers may resemble
we can soon see replied the police officer and ringing a bell he summoned an assistant to whom he issued a few directions
the man left the room but presently returned with a little hardwood box which he placed on his superior's desk
now said the officer you shall have your fingerprints in a second
he drew from the little case a square of plate glass a little tube of thick ink a rubber roller and a few snowy white cards
squeezing a drop of ink onto the glass he spread it back and forth with the rubber roller until the entire surface of the glass was covered to his satisfaction with a very thin and uniform layer of ink
place the four fingers of your right hand upon the glass thus he said to d'arnot
now the thumb
that is right
now place them in just the same position upon this card here noa little to the right
we must leave room for the thumb and the fingers of the left hand
there that's it
now the same with the left
come tarzan cried d'arnot let's see what your whorls look like
tarzan complied readily asking many questions of the officer during the operation
do fingerprints show racial characteristics
he asked
could you determine for example solely from fingerprints whether the subject was negro or caucasian
i think not replied the officer
could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those of a man
probably because the ape's would be far simpler than those of the higher organism
but a cross between an ape and a man might show the characteristics of either progenitor
continued tarzan
yes i should think likely responded the official but the science has not progressed sufficiently to render it exact enough in such matters
i should hate to trust its findings further than to differentiate between individuals
there it is absolute
no two people born into the world probably have ever had identical lines upon all their digits
it is very doubtful if any single fingerprint will ever be exactly duplicated by any finger other than the one which originally made it
does the comparison require much time or labor
asked d'arnot
ordinarily but a few moments if the impressions are distinct
d'arnot drew a little black book from his pocket and commenced turning the pages
tarzan looked at the book in surprise
how did d'arnot come to have his book
presently d'arnot stopped at a page on which were five tiny little smudges
he handed the open book to the policeman
are these imprints similar to mine or monsieur tarzan's or can you say that they are identical with either
the officer drew a powerful glass from his desk and examined all three specimens carefully making notations meanwhile upon a pad of paper
tarzan realized now what was the meaning of their visit to the police officer
the answer to his life's riddle lay in these tiny marks
with tense nerves he sat leaning forward in his chair but suddenly he relaxed and dropped back smiling
d'arnot looked at him in surprise
you forget that for twenty years the dead body of the child who made those fingerprints lay in the cabin of his father and that all my life i have seen it lying there said tarzan bitterly
the policeman looked up in astonishment
go ahead captain with your examination said d'arnot we will tell you the story laterprovided monsieur tarzan is agreeable
tarzan nodded his head
but you are mad my dear d'arnot he insisted
those little fingers are buried on the west coast of africa
i do not know as to that tarzan replied d'arnot
it is possible but if you are not the son of john clayton then how in heaven's name did you come into that god forsaken jungle where no white man other than john clayton had ever set foot
you forgetkala said tarzan
i do not even consider her replied d'arnot
the friends had walked to the broad window overlooking the boulevard as they talked
for some time they stood there gazing out upon the busy throng beneath each wrapped in his own thoughts
it takes some time to compare finger prints thought d'arnot turning to look at the police officer
to his astonishment he saw the official leaning back in his chair hastily scanning the contents of the little black diary
d'arnot coughed
the policeman looked up and catching his eye raised his finger to admonish silence
d'arnot turned back to the window and presently the police officer spoke
gentlemen he said
both turned toward him
there is evidently a great deal at stake which must hinge to a greater or lesser extent upon the absolute correctness of this comparison
i therefore ask that you leave the entire matter in my hands until monsieur desquerc our expert returns
it will be but a matter of a few days
i had hoped to know at once said d'arnot
monsieur tarzan sails for america tomorrow
i will promise that you can cable him a report within two weeks replied the officer but what it will be i dare not say
there are resemblances yetwell we had better leave it for monsieur desquerc to solve
chapter xxvii  the giant again   a taxicab drew up before an oldfashioned residence upon the outskirts of baltimore
a man of about forty well built and with strong regular features stepped out and paying the chauffeur dismissed him
a moment later the passenger was entering the library of the old home
ah mr
canler
exclaimed an old man rising to greet him
good evening my dear professor cried the man extending a cordial hand
who admitted you
asked the professor
esmeralda
then she will acquaint jane with the fact that you are here said the old man
no professor replied canler for i came primarily to see you
ah i am honored said professor porter
professor continued robert canler with great deliberation as though carefully weighing his words i have come this evening to speak with you about jane
you know my aspirations and you have been generous enough to approve my suit
professor archimedes q porter fidgeted in his armchair
the subject always made him uncomfortable
he could not understand why
canler was a splendid match
but jane continued canler i cannot understand her
she puts me off first on one ground and then another
i have always the feeling that she breathes a sigh of relief every time i bid her goodby
tut tut said professor porter
tut tut mr canler
jane is a most obedient daughter
she will do precisely as i tell her
then i can still count on your support
asked canler a tone of relief marking his voice
certainly sir certainly sir exclaimed professor porter
how could you doubt it
there is young clayton you know suggested canler
he has been hanging about for months
i don't know that jane cares for him but beside his title they say he has inherited a very considerable estate from his father and it might not be strangeif he finally won her unless and canler paused
tuttut mr canler unlesswhat
unless you see fit to request that jane and i be married at once said canler slowly and distinctly
i have already suggested to jane that it would be desirable said professor porter sadly for we can no longer afford to keep up this house and live as her associations demand
what was her reply
asked canler
she said she was not ready to marry anyone yet replied professor porter and that we could go and live upon the farm in northern wisconsin which her mother left her
it is a little more than selfsupporting
the tenants have always made a living from it and been able to send jane a trifle beside each year
she is planning on our going up there the first of the week
philander and mr clayton have already gone to get things in readiness for us
clayton has gone there
exclaimed canler visibly chagrined
why was i not told
i would gladly have gone and seen that every comfort was provided
jane feels that we are already too much in your debt mr canler said professor porter
canler was about to reply when the sound of footsteps came from the hall without and jane entered the room
oh i beg your pardon
she exclaimed pausing on the threshold
i thought you were alone papa
it is only i jane said canler who had risen won't you come in and join the family group
we were just speaking of you
thank you said jane entering and taking the chair canler placed for her
i only wanted to tell papa that tobey is coming down from the college tomorrow to pack his books
i want you to be sure papa to indicate all that you can do without until fall
please don't carry this entire library to wisconsin as you would have carried it to africa if i had not put my foot down
was tobey here
asked professor porter
yes i just left him
he and esmeralda are exchanging religious experiences on the back porch now
tut tut i must see him at once
cried the professor
excuse me just a moment children and the old man hastened from the room
as soon as he was out of earshot canler turned to jane
see here jane he said bluntly
how long is this thing going on like this
you haven't refused to marry me but you haven't promised either
i want to get the license tomorrow so that we can be married quietly before you leave for wisconsin
i don't care for any fuss or feathers and i'm sure you don't either
the girl turned cold but she held her head bravely
your father wishes it you know added canler
yes i know
she spoke scarcely above a whisper
do you realize that you are buying me mr
canler
she said finally and in a cold level voice
buying me for a few paltry dollars
of course you do robert canler and the hope of just such a contingency was in your mind when you loaned papa the money for that hairbrained escapade which but for a most mysterious circumstance would have been surprisingly successful
but you mr canler would have been the most surprised
you had no idea that the venture would succeed
you are too good a businessman for that
and you are too good a businessman to loan money for buried treasure seeking or to loan money without securityunless you had some special object in view
you knew that without security you had a greater hold on the honor of the porters than with it
you knew the one best way to force me to marry you without seeming to force me
you have never mentioned the loan
in any other man i should have thought that the prompting of a magnanimous and noble character
but you are deep mr robert canler
i know you better than you think i know you
i shall certainly marry you if there is no other way but let us understand each other once and for all
while she spoke robert canler had alternately flushed and paled and when she ceased speaking he arose and with a cynical smile upon his strong face said  you surprise me jane
i thought you had more selfcontrolmore pride
of course you are right
i am buying you and i knew that you knew it but i thought you would prefer to pretend that it was otherwise
i should have thought your self respect and your porter pride would have shrunk from admitting even to yourself that you were a bought woman
but have it your own way dear girl he added lightly
i am going to have you and that is all that interests me
without a word the girl turned and left the room
jane was not married before she left with her father and esmeralda for her little wisconsin farm and as she coldly bid robert canler goodby as her train pulled out he called to her that he would join them in a week or two
at their destination they were met by clayton and mr philander in a huge touring car belonging to the former and quickly whirled away through the dense northern woods toward the little farm which the girl had not visited before since childhood
the farmhouse which stood on a little elevation some hundred yards from the tenant house had undergone a complete transformation during the three weeks that clayton and mr philander had been there
the former had imported a small army of carpenters and plasterers plumbers and painters from a distant city and what had been but a dilapidated shell when they reached it was now a cosy little twostory house filled with every modern convenience procurable in so short a time
why mr clayton what have you done
cried jane porter her heart sinking within her as she realized the probable size of the expenditure that had been made
ssh cautioned clayton
don't let your father guess
if you don't tell him he will never notice and i simply couldn't think of him living in the terrible squalor and sordidness which mr philander and i found
it was so little when i would like to do so much jane
for his sake please never mention it
but you know that we can't repay you cried the girl
why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations
don't jane said clayton sadly
if it had been just you believe me i wouldn't have done it for i knew from the start that it would only hurt me in your eyes but i couldn't think of that dear old man living in the hole we found here
won't you please believe that i did it just for him and give me that little crumb of pleasure at least
i do believe you mr clayton said the girl because i know you are big enough and generous enough to have done it just for himand oh cecil i wish i might repay you as you deserveas you would wish
why can't you jane
because i love another
canler
no
but you are going to marry him
he told me as much before i left baltimore
the girl winced
i do not love him she said almost proudly
is it because of the money jane
she nodded
then am i so much less desirable than canler
i have money enough and far more for every need he said bitterly
i do not love you cecil she said but i respect you
if i must disgrace myself by such a bargain with any man i prefer that it be one i already despise
i should loathe the man to whom i sold myself without love whomsoever he might be
you will be happier she concluded alonewith my respect and friendship than with me and my contempt
he did not press the matter further but if ever a man had murder in his heart it was william cecil clayton lord greystoke when a week later robert canler drew up before the farmhouse in his purring six cylinder
a week passed a tense uneventful but uncomfortable week for all the inmates of the little wisconsin farmhouse
canler was insistent that jane marry him at once
at length she gave in from sheer loathing of the continued and hateful importuning
it was agreed that on the morrow canler was to drive to town and bring back the license and a minister
clayton had wanted to leave as soon as the plan was announced but the girl's tired hopeless look kept him
he could not desert her
something might happen yet he tried to console himself by thinking
and in his heart he knew that it would require but a tiny spark to turn his hatred for canler into the blood lust of the killer
early the next morning canler set out for town
in the east smoke could be seen lying low over the forest for a fire had been raging for a week not far from them but the wind still lay in the west and no danger threatened them
about noon jane started off for a walk
she would not let clayton accompany her
she wanted to be alone she said and he respected her wishes
in the house professor porter and mr philander were immersed in an absorbing discussion of some weighty scientific problem
esmeralda dozed in the kitchen and clayton heavyeyed after a sleepless night threw himself down upon the couch in the living room and soon dropped into a fitful slumber
to the east the black smoke clouds rose higher into the heavens suddenly they eddied and then commenced to drift rapidly toward the west
on and on they came
the inmates of the tenant house were gone for it was market day and none was there to see the rapid approach of the fiery demon
soon the flames had spanned the road to the south and cut off canler's return
a little fluctuation of the wind now carried the path of the forest fire to the north then blew back and the flames nearly stood still as though held in leash by some master hand
suddenly out of the northeast a great black car came careening down the road
with a jolt it stopped before the cottage and a blackhaired giant leaped out to run up onto the porch
without a pause he rushed into the house
on the couch lay clayton
the man started in surprise but with a bound was at the side of the sleeping man
shaking him roughly by the shoulder he cried  my god clayton are you all mad here
don't you know you are nearly surrounded by fire
where is miss porter
clayton sprang to his feet
he did not recognize the man but he understood the words and was upon the veranda in a bound
scott
he cried and then dashing back into the house jane
jane
where are you
in an instant esmeralda professor porter and mr philander had joined the two men
where is miss jane
cried clayton seizing esmeralda by the shoulders and shaking her roughly
oh gaberelle mister clayton she done gone for a walk
hasn't she come back yet
and without waiting for a reply clayton dashed out into the yard followed by the others
which way did she go
cried the blackhaired giant of esmeralda
down that road cried the frightened woman pointing toward the south where a mighty wall of roaring flames shut out the view
put these people in the other car shouted the stranger to clayton
i saw one as i drove upand get them out of here by the north road
leave my car here
if i find miss porter we shall need it
if i don't no one will need it
do as i say as clayton hesitated and then they saw the lithe figure bound away cross the clearing toward the northwest where the forest still stood untouched by flame
in each rose the unaccountable feeling that a great responsibility had been raised from their shoulders a kind of implicit confidence in the power of the stranger to save jane if she could be saved
who was that
asked professor porter
i do not know replied clayton
he called me by name and he knew jane for he asked for her
and he called esmeralda by name
there was something most startlingly familiar about him exclaimed mr philander and yet bless me i know i never saw him before
tut tut
cried professor porter
most remarkable
who could it have been and why do i feel that jane is safe now that he has set out in search of her
i can't tell you professor said clayton soberly but i know i have the same uncanny feeling
but come he cried we must get out of here ourselves or we shall be shut off and the party hastened toward clayton's car
when jane turned to retrace her steps homeward she was alarmed to note how near the smoke of the forest fire seemed and as she hastened onward her alarm became almost a panic when she perceived that the rushing flames were rapidly forcing their way between herself and the cottage
at length she was compelled to turn into the dense thicket and attempt to force her way to the west in an effort to circle around the flames and reach the house
in a short time the futility of her attempt became apparent and then her one hope lay in retracing her steps to the road and flying for her life to the south toward the town
the twenty minutes that it took her to regain the road was all that had been needed to cut off her retreat as effectually as her advance had been cut off before
a short run down the road brought her to a horrified stand for there before her was another wall of flame
an arm of the main conflagration had shot out a half mile south of its parent to embrace this tiny strip of road in its implacable clutches
jane knew that it was useless again to attempt to force her way through the undergrowth
she had tried it once and failed
now she realized that it would be but a matter of minutes ere the whole space between the north and the south would be a seething mass of billowing flames
calmly the girl kneeled down in the dust of the roadway and prayed for strength to meet her fate bravely and for the delivery of her father and her friends from death
suddenly she heard her name being called aloud through the forest  jane
jane porter
it rang strong and clear but in a strange voice
here
she called in reply
here
in the roadway
then through the branches of the trees she saw a figure swinging with the speed of a squirrel
a veering of the wind blew a cloud of smoke about them and she could no longer see the man who was speeding toward her but suddenly she felt a great arm about her
then she was lifted up and she felt the rushing of the wind and the occasional brush of a branch as she was borne along
she opened her eyes
far below her lay the undergrowth and the hard earth
about her was the waving foliage of the forest
from tree to tree swung the giant figure which bore her and it seemed to jane that she was living over in a dream the experience that had been hers in that far african jungle
oh if it were but the same man who had borne her so swiftly through the tangled verdure on that other day
but that was impossible
yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing
she stole a sudden glance at the face close to hers and then she gave a little frightened gasp
it was he
my forest man
she murmured
no i must be delirious
yes your man jane porter
your savage primeval man come out of the jungle to claim his matethe woman who ran away from him he added almost fiercely
i did not run away she whispered
i would only consent to leave when they had waited a week for you to return
they had come to a point beyond the fire now and he had turned back to the clearing
side by side they were walking toward the cottage
the wind had changed once more and the fire was burning back upon itselfanother hour like that and it would be burned out
why did you not return
she asked
i was nursing d'arnot
he was badly wounded
ah i knew it
she exclaimed
they said you had gone to join the blacksthat they were your people
he laughed
but you did not believe them jane
nowhat shall i call you
she asked
what is your name
i was tarzan of the apes when you first knew me he said
tarzan of the apes
she criedand that was your note i answered when i left
yes whose did you think it was
i did not know only that it could not be yours for tarzan of the apes had written in english and you could not understand a word of any language
again he laughed
it is a long story but it was i who wrote what i could not speakand now d'arnot has made matters worse by teaching me to speak french instead of english
come he added jump into my car we must overtake your father they are only a little way ahead
as they drove along he said  then when you said in your note to tarzan of the apes that you loved anotheryou might have meant me
i might have she answered simply
but in baltimoreoh how i have searched for youthey told me you would possibly be married by now
that a man named canler had come up here to wed you
is that true
yes
do you love him
no
do you love me
she buried her face in her hands
i am promised to another
i cannot answer you tarzan of the apes she cried
you have answered
now tell me why you would marry one you do not love
my father owes him money
suddenly there came back to tarzan the memory of the letter he had readand the name robert canler and the hinted trouble which he had been unable to understand then
he smiled
if your father had not lost the treasure you would not feel forced to keep your promise to this man canler
i could ask him to release me
and if he refused
i have given my promise
he was silent for a moment
the car was plunging along the uneven road at a reckless pace for the fire showed threateningly at their right and another change of the wind might sweep it on with raging fury across this one avenue of escape
finally they passed the danger point and tarzan reduced their speed
suppose i should ask him
ventured tarzan
he would scarcely accede to the demand of a stranger said the girl
especially one who wanted me himself
terkoz did said tarzan grimly
jane shuddered and looked fearfully up at the giant figure beside her for she knew that he meant the great anthropoid he had killed in her defense
this is not the african jungle she said
you are no longer a savage beast
you are a gentleman and gentlemen do not kill in cold blood
i am still a wild beast at heart he said in a low voice as though to himself
again they were silent for a time
jane said the man at length if you were free would you marry me
she did not reply at once but he waited patiently
the girl was trying to collect her thoughts
what did she know of this strange creature at her side
what did he know of himself
who was he
who his parents
why his very name echoed his mysterious origin and his savage life
he had no name
could she be happy with this jungle waif
could she find anything in common with a husband whose life had been spent in the tree tops of an african wilderness frolicking and fighting with fierce anthropoids tearing his food from the quivering flank of freshkilled prey sinking his strong teeth into raw flesh and tearing away his portion while his mates growled and fought about him for their share
could he ever rise to her social sphere
could she bear to think of sinking to his
would either be happy in such a horrible misalliance
you do not answer he said
do you shrink from wounding me
i do not know what answer to make said jane sadly
i do not know my own mind
you do not love me then
he asked in a level tone
do not ask me
you will be happier without me
you were never meant for the formal restrictions and conventionalities of societycivilization would become irksome to you and in a little while you would long for the freedom of your old lifea life to which i am as totally unfitted as you to mine
i think i understand you he replied quietly
i shall not urge you for i would rather see you happy than to be happy myself
i see now that you could not be happy withan ape
there was just the faintest tinge of bitterness in his voice
don't she remonstrated
don't say that
you do not understand
but before she could go on a sudden turn in the road brought them into the midst of a little hamlet
before them stood clayton's car surrounded by the party he had brought from the cottage
chapter xxviii  conclusion   at the sight of jane cries of relief and delight broke from every lip and as tarzan's car stopped beside the other professor porter caught his daughter in his arms
for a moment no one noticed tarzan sitting silently in his seat
clayton was the first to remember and turning held out his hand
how can we ever thank you
he exclaimed
you have saved us all
you called me by name at the cottage but i do not seem to recall yours though there is something very familiar about you
it is as though i had known you well under very different conditions a long time ago
tarzan smiled as he took the proffered hand
you are quite right monsieur clayton he said in french
you will pardon me if i do not speak to you in english
i am just learning it and while i understand it fairly well i speak it very poorly
but who are you
insisted clayton speaking in french this time himself
tarzan of the apes
clayton started back in surprise
by jove
he exclaimed
it is true
and professor porter and mr philander pressed forward to add their thanks to clayton's and to voice their surprise and pleasure at seeing their jungle friend so far from his savage home
the party now entered the modest little hostelry where clayton soon made arrangements for their entertainment
they were sitting in the little stuffy parlor when the distant chugging of an approaching automobile caught their attention
mr philander who was sitting near the window looked out as the car drew in sight finally stopping beside the other automobiles
bless me
said mr philander a shade of annoyance in his tone
it is mr canler
i had hoped eri had thought orerhow very happy we should be that he was not caught in the fire he ended lamely
tut tut
mr philander said professor porter
tut tut
i have often admonished my pupils to count ten before speaking
were i you mr philander i should count at least a thousand and then maintain a discreet silence
bless me yes
acquiesced mr philander
but who is the clerical appearing gentleman with him
jane blanched
clayton moved uneasily in his chair
professor porter removed his spectacles nervously and breathed upon them but replaced them on his nose without wiping
the ubiquitous esmeralda grunted
only tarzan did not comprehend
presently robert canler burst into the room
thank god
he cried
i feared the worst until i saw your car clayton
i was cut off on the south road and had to go away back to town and then strike east to this road
i thought we'd never reach the cottage
no one seemed to enthuse much
tarzan eyed robert canler as sabor eyes her prey
jane glanced at him and coughed nervously
mr canler she said this is monsieur tarzan an old friend
canler turned and extended his hand
tarzan rose and bowed as only d'arnot could have taught a gentleman to do it but he did not seem to see canler's hand
nor did canler appear to notice the oversight
this is the reverend mr tousley jane said canler turning to the clerical party behind him
mr tousley miss porter
mr tousley bowed and beamed
canler introduced him to the others
we can have the ceremony at once jane said canler
then you and i can catch the midnight train in town
tarzan understood the plan instantly
he glanced out of halfclosed eyes at jane but he did not move
the girl hesitated
the room was tense with the silence of taut nerves
all eyes turned toward jane awaiting her reply
can't we wait a few days
she asked
i am all unstrung
i have been through so much today
canler felt the hostility that emanated from each member of the party
it made him angry
we have waited as long as i intend to wait he said roughly
you have promised to marry me
i shall be played with no longer
i have the license and here is the preacher
come mr tousley come jane
there are plenty of witnessesmore than enough he added with a disagreeable inflection and taking jane porter by the arm he started to lead her toward the waiting minister
but scarcely had he taken a single step ere a heavy hand closed upon his arm with a grip of steel
another hand shot to his throat and in a moment he was being shaken high above the floor as a cat might shake a mouse
jane turned in horrified surprise toward tarzan
and as she looked into his face she saw the crimson band upon his forehead that she had seen that other day in far distant africa when tarzan of the apes had closed in mortal combat with the great anthropoidterkoz
she knew that murder lay in that savage heart and with a little cry of horror she sprang forward to plead with the apeman
but her fears were more for tarzan than for canler
she realized the stern retribution which justice metes to the murderer
before she could reach them however clayton had jumped to tarzan's side and attempted to drag canler from his grasp
with a single sweep of one mighty arm the englishman was hurled across the room and then jane laid a firm white hand upon tarzan's wrist and looked up into his eyes
for my sake she said
the grasp upon canler's throat relaxed
tarzan looked down into the beautiful face before him
do you wish this to live
he asked in surprise
i do not wish him to die at your hands my friend she replied
i do not wish you to become a murderer
tarzan removed his hand from canler's throat
do you release her from her promise
he asked
it is the price of your life
canler gasping for breath nodded
will you go away and never molest her further
again the man nodded his head his face distorted by fear of the death that had been so close
tarzan released him and canler staggered toward the door
in another moment he was gone and the terrorstricken preacher with him
tarzan turned toward jane
may i speak with you for a moment alone he asked
the girl nodded and started toward the door leading to the narrow veranda of the little hotel
she passed out to await tarzan and so did not hear the conversation which followed
wait cried professor porter as tarzan was about to follow
the professor had been stricken dumb with surprise by the rapid developments of the past few minutes
before we go further sir i should like an explanation of the events which have just transpired
by what right sir did you interfere between my daughter and mr canler
i had promised him her hand sir and regardless of our personal likes or dislikes sir that promise must be kept
i interfered professor porter replied tarzan because your daughter does not love mr canlershe does not wish to marry him
that is enough for me to know
you do not know what you have done said professor porter
now he will doubtless refuse to marry her
he most certainly will said tarzan emphatically
and further added tarzan you need not fear that your pride will suffer professor porter for you will be able to pay the canler person what you owe him the moment you reach home
tut tut sir
exclaimed professor porter
what do you mean sir
your treasure has been found said tarzan
whatwhat is that you are saying
cried the professor
you are mad man
it cannot be
it is though
it was i who stole it not knowing either its value or to whom it belonged
i saw the sailors bury it and apelike i had to dig it up and bury it again elsewhere
when d'arnot told me what it was and what it meant to you i returned to the jungle and recovered it
it had caused so much crime and suffering and sorrow that d'arnot thought it best not to attempt to bring the treasure itself on here as had been my intention so i have brought a letter of credit instead
here it is professor porter and tarzan drew an envelope from his pocket and handed it to the astonished professor two hundred and fortyone thousand dollars
the treasure was most carefully appraised by experts but lest there should be any question in your mind d'arnot himself bought it and is holding it for you should you prefer the treasure to the credit
to the already great burden of the obligations we owe you sir said professor porter with trembling voice is now added this greatest of all services
you have given me the means to save my honor
clayton who had left the room a moment after canler now returned
pardon me he said
i think we had better try to reach town before dark and take the first train out of this forest
a native just rode by from the north who reports that the fire is moving slowly in this direction
this announcement broke up further conversation and the entire party went out to the waiting automobiles
clayton with jane the professor and esmeralda occupied clayton's car while tarzan took mr philander in with him
bless me
exclaimed mr philander as the car moved off after clayton
who would ever have thought it possible
the last time i saw you you were a veritable wild man skipping about among the branches of a tropical african forest and now you are driving me along a wisconsin road in a french automobile
bless me
but it is most remarkable
yes assented tarzan and then after a pause mr philander do you recall any of the details of the finding and burying of three skeletons found in my cabin beside that african jungle
very distinctly sir very distinctly replied mr philander
was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons
mr philander eyed tarzan narrowly
why do you ask
it means a great deal to me to know replied tarzan
your answer may clear up a mystery
it can do no worse at any rate than to leave it still a mystery
i have been entertaining a theory concerning those skeletons for the past two months and i want you to answer my question to the best of your knowledgewere the three skeletons you buried all human skeletons
no said mr philander the smallest one the one found in the crib was the skeleton of an anthropoid ape
thank you said tarzan
in the car ahead jane was thinking fast and furiously
she had felt the purpose for which tarzan had asked a few words with her and she knew that she must be prepared to give him an answer in the very near future
he was not the sort of person one could put off and somehow that very thought made her wonder if she did not really fear him
and could she love where she feared
she realized the spell that had been upon her in the depths of that faroff jungle but there was no spell of enchantment now in prosaic wisconsin
nor did the immaculate young frenchman appeal to the primal woman in her as had the stalwart forest god
did she love him
she did not knownow
she glanced at clayton out of the corner of her eye
was not here a man trained in the same school of environment in which she had been traineda man with social position and culture such as she had been taught to consider as the prime essentials to congenial association
did not her best judgment point to this young english nobleman whose love she knew to be of the sort a civilized woman should crave as the logical mate for such as herself
could she love clayton
she could see no reason why she could not
jane was not coldly calculating by nature but training environment and heredity had all combined to teach her to reason even in matters of the heart
that she had been carried off her feet by the strength of the young giant when his great arms were about her in the distant african forest and again today in the wisconsin woods seemed to her only attributable to a temporary mental reversion to type on her partto the psychological appeal of the primeval man to the primeval woman in her nature
if he should never touch her again she reasoned she would never feel attracted toward him
she had not loved him then
it had been nothing more than a passing hallucination superinduced by excitement and by personal contact
excitement would not always mark their future relations should she marry him and the power of personal contact eventually would be dulled by familiarity
again she glanced at clayton
he was very handsome and every inch a gentleman
she should be very proud of such a husband
and then he spokea minute sooner or a minute later might have made all the difference in the world to three livesbut chance stepped in and pointed out to clayton the psychological moment
you are free now jane he said
won't you say yesi will devote my life to making you very happy
yes she whispered
that evening in the little waiting room at the station tarzan caught jane alone for a moment
you are free now jane he said and i have come across the ages out of the dim and distant past from the lair of the primeval man to claim youfor your sake i have become a civilized manfor your sake i have crossed oceans and continentsfor your sake i will be whatever you will me to be
i can make you happy jane in the life you know and love best
will you marry me
for the first time she realized the depths of the man's loveall that he had accomplished in so short a time solely for love of her
turning her head she buried her face in her arms
what had she done
because she had been afraid she might succumb to the pleas of this giant she had burned her bridges behind herin her groundless apprehension that she might make a terrible mistake she had made a worse one
and then she told him alltold him the truth word by word without attempting to shield herself or condone her error
what can we do
he asked
you have admitted that you love me
you know that i love you but i do not know the ethics of society by which you are governed
i shall leave the decision to you for you know best what will be for your eventual welfare
i cannot tell him tarzan she said
he too loves me and he is a good man
i could never face you nor any other honest person if i repudiated my promise to mr clayton
i shall have to keep itand you must help me bear the burden though we may not see each other again after tonight
the others were entering the room now and tarzan turned toward the little window
but he saw nothing outsidewithin he saw a patch of greensward surrounded by a matted mass of gorgeous tropical plants and flowers and above the waving foliage of mighty trees and over all the blue of an equatorial sky
in the center of the greensward a young woman sat upon a little mound of earth and beside her sat a young giant
they ate pleasant fruit and looked into each other's eyes and smiled
they were very happy and they were all alone
his thoughts were broken in upon by the station agent who entered asking if there was a gentleman by the name of tarzan in the party
i am monsieur tarzan said the apeman
here is a message for you forwarded from baltimore it is a cablegram from paris
tarzan took the envelope and tore it open
the message was from d'arnot
it read   fingerprints prove you greystoke
congratulations
d'arnot
as tarzan finished reading clayton entered and came toward him with extended hand
here was the man who had tarzan's title and tarzan's estates and was going to marry the woman whom tarzan lovedthe woman who loved tarzan
a single word from tarzan would make a great difference in this man's life
it would take away his title and his lands and his castles andit would take them away from jane porter also
i say old man cried clayton i haven't had a chance to thank you for all you've done for us
it seems as though you had your hands full saving our lives in africa and here
i'm awfully glad you came on here
we must get better acquainted
i often thought about you you know and the remarkable circumstances of your environment
if it's any of my business how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle
i was born there said tarzan quietly
my mother was an ape and of course she couldn't tell me much about it
i never knew who my father was
