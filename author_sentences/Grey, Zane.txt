prologue   i  a face haunted camerona woman's face
it was there in the white heart of the dying campfire it hung in the shadows that hovered over the flickering light it drifted in the darkness beyond
this hour when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in with its dead silence was one in which cameron's mind was thronged with memories of a time long pastof a home back in peoria of a woman he had wronged and lost and loved too late
he was a prospector for gold a hunter of solitude a lover of the drear rockribbed infinitude because he wanted to be alone to remember
a sound disturbed cameron's reflections
he bent his head listening
a soft wind fanned the paling embers blew sparks and white ashes and thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness
his burro did not appear to be moving about
the quiet split to the cry of a coyote
it rose strange wild mournfulnot the howl of a prowling upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector but the wail of a wolf fullvoiced crying out the meaning of the desert and the night
hunger throbbed in ithunger for a mate for offspring for life
when it ceased the terrible desert silence smote cameron and the cry echoed in his soul
he and that wandering wolf were brothers
then a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand prompted cameron to reach for his gun and to move out of the light of the waning campfire
he was somewhere along the wild border line between sonora and arizona and the prospector who dared the heat and barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing
figures darker than the gloom approached and took shape and in the light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro
hello there the man called as he came to a halt and gazed about him
i saw your fire
may i make camp here
cameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor whom he took for a prospector like himself
cameron resented the breaking of his lonely campfire vigil but he respected the law of the desert
the stranger thanked him and then slipped the pack from his burro
then he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal
his movements were slow and methodical
cameron watched him still with resentment yet with a curious and growing interest
the campfire burst into a bright blaze and by its light cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength
find any mineral
asked cameron presently
his visitor looked up quickly as if startled by the sound of a human voice
he replied and then the two men talked a little
but the stranger evidently preferred silence
cameron understood that
he laughed grimly and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed shadowy face
another of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some relentless driving power besides the lust for gold
cameron felt that between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity vague and undefined perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert wanderer like himself perhaps born of a deeper an unintelligible relation having its roots back in the past
a longforgotten sensation stirred in cameron's breast one so long forgotten that he could not recognize it
but it was akin to pain
ii  when he awakened he found to his surprise that his companion had departed
a trail in the sand led off to the north
there was no water in that direction
cameron shrugged his shoulders it was not his affair he had his own problems
and straightway he forgot his strange visitor
cameron began his day grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken for the canyonfurrowed and cactusspired scene that now showed no sign of life
he traveled southwest never straying far from the dry stream bed and in a desultory way without eagerness he hunted for signs of gold
the work was toilsome yet the periods of rest in which he indulged were not taken because of fatigue
he rested to look to listen to feel
what the vast silent world meant to him had always been a mystical thing which he felt in all its incalculable power but never understood
that day while it was yet light and he was digging in a moist whitebordered wash for water he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone
there down the canyon came a man and a burro
cameron recognized them
hello friend called the man halting
our trails crossed again
that's good
hello replied cameron slowly
any mineral sign today
no
they made camp together ate their frugal meal smoked a pipe and rolled in their blankets without exchanging many words
in the morning the same reticence the same aloofness characterized the manner of both
but cameron's companion when he had packed his burro and was ready to start faced about and said  we might stay together if it's all right with you
i never take a partner replied cameron
you're alone i'm alone said the other mildly
it's a big place
if we find gold there'll be enough for two
i don't go down into the desert for gold alone rejoined cameron with a chill note in his swift reply
his companion's deepset luminous eyes emitted a singular flash
it moved cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had met no man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat the blinding dust storms the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus the terrible silence and desolation of the desert
cameron waved a hand toward the wide shimmering shadowy descent of plain and range
i may strike through the sonora desert
i may head for pinacate or north for the colorado basin
you are an old man
i don't know the country but to me one place is the same as another replied his companion
for moments he seemed to forget himself and swept his farreaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and sand
then with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind cameron
yes i'm old
i'm lonely too
it's come to me just lately
but friend i can still travel and for a few days my company won't hurt you
have it your way said cameron
they began a slow march down into the desert
at sunset they camped under the lee of a low mesa
cameron was glad his comrade had the indian habit of silence
another day's travel found the prospectors deep in the wilderness
then there came a breaking of reserve noticeable in the elder man almost imperceptibly gradual in cameron
beside the meager mesquite campfire this grayfaced thoughtful old prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little and cameron would listen and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a word
and so as cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert less lonely than habitual he began to take keener note of his comrade and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the wilderness
this man never grumbled at the heat the glare the driving sand the sour water the scant fare
during the daylight hours he was seldom idle
at night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and fro in the gloom
he slept but little and that long after cameron had had his own rest
he was tireless patient brooding
cameron's awakened interest brought home to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship
in those years only three men had wandered into the desert with him and these had left their bones to bleach in the shifting sands
cameron had not cared to know their secrets
but the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began to suspect that he might have missed something in the others
in his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation where he could be alone with it he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men
somehow this silent comrade reminded him
one afternoon late after they had toiled up a white winding wash of sand and gravel they came upon a dry waterhole
cameron dug deep into the sand but without avail
he was turning to retrace weary steps back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait
cameron watched him search in his pack and bring forth what appeared to be a small forked branch of a peach tree
he grasped the prongs of the fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out and then he began to walk along the stream bed
cameron at first amused then amazed then pitying and at last curious kept pace with the prospector
he saw a strong tension of his comrade's wrists as if he was holding hard against a considerable force
the end of the peach branch began to quiver and turn
cameron reached out a hand to touch it and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the branch downward
he felt it as a magnetic shock
the branch kept turning and at length pointed to the ground
dig here said the prospector
what
ejaculated cameron
had the man lost his mind
then cameron stood by while his comrade dug in the sand
three feet he dugfourfive and the sand grew dark then moist
at six feet water began to seep through
get the little basket in my pack he said
cameron complied and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep hole where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to seep through
while cameron watched the basket filled
of all the strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest
curiously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it held
the thing however was dead in his hands
i see you haven't got it remarked his comrade
few men have
got what
demanded cameron
a power to find water that way
back in illinois an old german used to do that to locate wells
he showed me i had the same power
i can't explain
but you needn't look so dumfounded
there's nothing supernatural about it
you mean it's a simple factthat some men have a magnetism a force or power to find water as you did
yes
it's not unusual on the farms back in illinois ohio pennsylvania
the old german i spoke of made money traveling round with his peach fork
what a gift for a man in the desert
cameron's comrade smiledthe second time in all those days
they entered a region where mineral abounded and their march became slower
generally they took the course of a wash one on each side and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the bleached blades of scant grass or at sage or cactus while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold
when they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical test
the search was fascinating
they interspersed the work with long restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains
some impelling desire not all the lure of gold took them to the top of mesas and escarpments and here when they had dug and picked they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect
then as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind fardistant spurs they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water
when they found it they unpacked gave drink to the tired burros and turned them loose
dead mesquite served for the campfire
while the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones with eyes on the dying embers of the fire and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces
each succeeding day and night cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man
he found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade
he reflected that after a few weeks in the desert he had always become a different man
in civilization in the rough mining camps he had been a prey to unrest and gloom
but once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness
did not the desert magnify men
cameron believed that wild men in wild places fighting cold heat starvation thirst barrenness facing the elements in all their ferocity usually retrograded descended to the savage lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes
likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble wonderful superhuman
so now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man alone on the desert driven there by life's mysterious and remorseless motive were to see each other through god's eyes
his companion was one who thought of himself last
it humiliated cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from doing more than an equal share of the day's work
the man was mild gentle quiet mostly silent yet under all his softness he seemed to be made of the fiber of steel
cameron could not thwart him
moreover he appeared to want to find gold for cameron not for himself
cameron's hands always trembled at the turning of rock that promised gold he had enough of the prospector's passion for fortune to thrill at the chance of a strike
but the other never showed the least trace of excitement
one night they were encamped at the head of a canyon
the day had been exceedingly hot and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the rocks persisted
a desert bird whistled a wild melancholy note from a dark cliff and a distant coyote wailed mournfully
the stars shone white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness
and on this night cameron watched his comrade and yielded to interest he had not heretofore voiced
pardner what drives you into the desert
do i seem to be a driven man
no
but i feel it
do you come to forget
yes
ah
softly exclaimed cameron
always he seemed to have known that
he said no more
he watched the old man rise and begin his nightly pace to and fro up and down
with slow soft tread forward and back tirelessly and ceaselessly he paced that beat
he did not look up at the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon ramparts
he hung his head
he was lost in another world
it was a world which the lonely desert made real
he looked a dark sad plodding figure and somehow impressed cameron with the helplessness of men
cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast of the fire in his heart the strife and torment of his passiondriven soul
he had come into the desert to remember a woman
she appeared to him then as she had looked when first she entered his lifea goldenhaired girl blueeyed whiteskinned redlipped tall and slender and beautiful
he had never forgotten and an old sickening remorse knocked at his heart
he rose and climbed out of the canyon and to the top of a mesa where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird and mystic shadows like the darkness of his passion and farther on down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the cold blue horizon
the moon soared radiant and calm the white stars shone serene
the vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine
the desert surrounded him silverstreaked and blackmantled a chaos of rock and sand silent austere ancient always waiting
it spoke to cameron
it was a naked corpse but it had a soul
in that wild solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly
they had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was now dead and might again throb with life only to die
it was a terrible ordeal for him to stand alone and realize that he was only a man facing eternity
but that was what gave him strength to endure
somehow he was a part of it all some atom in that vastness somehow necessary to an inscrutable purpose something indestructible in that desolate world of ruin and death and decay something perishable and changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven
in that endless silent hall of desert there was a spirit and cameron felt hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace
he returned to camp and sought his comrade
i reckon we're two of a kind he said
it was a woman who drove me into the desert
but i come to remember
the desert's the only place i can do that
was she your wife
asked the elder man
no
a long silence ensued
a cool wind blew up the canyon sifting the sand through the dry sage driving away the last of the lingering heat
the campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap
i had a daughter said cameron's comrade
she lost her mother at birth
and ii didn't know how to bring up a girl
she was pretty and gay
it was thethe old story
his words were peculiarly significant to cameron
they distressed him
he had been wrapped up in his remorse
if ever in the past he had thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long forgotten
but the consequences of such wrong were farreaching
they struck at the roots of a home
here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man a father wasting his life because he could not forgetbecause there was nothing left to live for
cameron understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert
well tell me more
asked cameron earnestly
it was the old old story
my girl was pretty and free
the young bucks ran after her
i guess she did not run away from them
and i was away a good dealworking in another town
she was in love with a wild fellow
i knew nothing of it till too late
he was engaged to marry her
but he didn't come back
and when the disgrace became plain to all my girl left home
she went west
after a while i heard from her
she was wellworkingliving for her baby
a long time passed
i had no ties
i drifted west
her lover had also gone west
in those days everybody went west
i trailed him intending to kill him
but i lost his trail
neither could i find any trace of her
she had moved on driven no doubt by the hound of her past
since then i have taken to the wilds hunting gold on the desert
yes it's the old old story only sadder i think said cameron and his voice was strained and unnatural
pardner what illinois town was it you hailed from
peoria
and youryour name
went on cameron huskily
warrenjonas warren
that name might as well have been a bullet
cameron stood erect motionless as men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight through the heart
in an instant when thoughts resurged like blinding flashes of lightning through his mind he was a swaying quivering terrorstricken man
he mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the shadow
but he need not have feared discovery however surely his agitation might have betrayed him
warren sat brooding over the campfire oblivious of his comrade absorbed in the past
cameron swiftly walked away in the gloom with the blood thrumming thick in his ears whispering over and over  merciful god
nell was his daughter
iii  as thought and feeling multiplied cameron was overwhelmed
beyond belief indeed was it that out of the millions of men in the world two who had never seen each other could have been driven into the desert by memory of the same woman
it brought the past so close
it showed cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had happened long ago
that which made life significant to him was a wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret
some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had wrecked
it was incomprehensible it was terrible
it was the one thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both father and lover would have found unendurable
cameron's pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between warren and himself
something within him cried out to him to reveal his identity
warren would kill him but it was not fear of death that put cameron on the rack
he had faced death too often to be afraid
it was the thought of adding torture to this longsuffering man
all at once cameron swore that he would not augment warren's trouble or let him stain his hands with blood
he would tell the truth of nell's sad story and his own and make what amends he could
then cameron's thought shifted from father to daughter
she was somewhere beyond the dim horizon line
in those past lonely hours by the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of nell
but his remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him
nell had struggled upward out of menacing depths
she had reconstructed a broken life
and now she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child
little nell
cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his beingthe physical rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness
as cameron gazed out over the bloodred darkening desert suddenly the strife in his soul ceased
the moment was one of incalculable change in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range and mystery of gloom and shadowto see with strong vision the illimitable space before him
he felt the grandeur of the desert its simplicity its truth
he had learned at last the lesson it taught
no longer strange was his meeting and wandering with warren
each had marched in the steps of destiny and as the lines of their fates had been inextricably tangled in the years that were gone so now their steps had crossed and turned them toward one common goal
for years they had been two men marching alone answering to an inward driving search and the desert had brought them together
for years they had wandered alone in silence and solitude where the sun burned white all day and the stars burned white all night blindly following the whisper of a spirit
but now cameron knew that he was no longer blind and in this flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help warren with his burden
he returned to camp trying to evolve a plan
as always at that long hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west warren plodded to and fro in the gloom
all night cameron lay awake thinking
in the morning when warren brought the burros to camp and began preparations for the usual packing cameron broke silence
pardner your story last night made me think
i want to tell you something about myself
it's hard enough to be driven by sorrow for one you've loved as you've been driven but to suffer sleepless and eternal remorse for the ruin of one you've loved as i have sufferedthat is hell
listen
in my younger daysit seems long now yet it's not so many yearsi was wild
i wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl i ever knew
i went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her
along about that time i fell into terrible moodsi changedi learned i really loved her
then came a letter i should have gotten months before
it told of her troubleimportuned me to hurry to save her
half frantic with shame and fear i got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town
she was gonehad been gone for weeks and her disgrace was known
friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father
i trailed herfound her
i married her
but too late
she would not live with me
she left mei followed her west but never found her
warren leaned forward a little and looked into cameron's eyes as if searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving of a man's scorn
cameron met the gaze unflinchingly and again began to speak  you know of course how men out here somehow lose old names old identities
it won't surprise you much to learn my name really isn't cameron as i once told you
warren stiffened upright
it seemed that there might have been a blank a suspension between his grave interest and some strange mood to come
cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast all his body grew cold and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form words
warren i'm the man you're hunting
i'm burton
i was nell's lover
the old man rose and towered over cameron and then plunged down upon him and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands
the harsh contact the pain awakened cameron to his peril before it was too late
desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and stamped and crushed
warren seemed a maddened giant
there was a reeling swaying wrestling struggle before the elder man began to weaken
the cameron buffeted bloody halfstunned panted for speech
warrenhold on
give mea minute
i married nell
didn't you know that
i saved the child
cameron felt the shock that vibrated through warren
he repeated the words again and again
as if compelled by some resistless power warren released cameron and staggering back stood with uplifted shaking hands
in his face was a horrible darkness
warren
waitlisten
panted cameron
i've got that marriage certificatei've had it by me all these years
i kept itto prove to myself i did right
the old man uttered a broken cry
cameron stole off among the rocks
how long he absented himself or what he did he had no idea
when he returned warren was sitting before the campfire and once more he appeared composed
he spoke and his voice had a deeper note but otherwise he seemed as usual
they packed the burros and faced the north together
cameron experienced a singular exaltation
he had lightened his comrade's burden
wonderfully it came to him that he had also lightened his own
from that hour it was not torment to think of nell
walking with his comrade through the silent places lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to himphantoms whispering peace
in the moan of the cool wind in the silken seep of sifting sand in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable
even in the white noonday under the burning sun these phantoms came to be real to him
in the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert windnature's voices of motherhood whispers of god peace in the solitude
iv  there came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull smoky haze
we're in for sandstorms said cameron
they had scarcely covered a mile when a desertwide moaning yellow wall of flying sand swooped down upon them
seeking shelter in the lee of a rock they waited hoping the storm was only a squall such as frequently whipped across the open places
the moan increased to a roar and the dull red slowly dimmed to disappear in the yellow pall and the air grew thick and dark
warren slipped the packs from the burros
cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of their usual season
the men covered their heads and patiently waited
the long hours dragged and the storm increased in fury
cameron and warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens and bound them round their faces and then covered their heads
the steady hollow bellow of flying sand went on
it flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men
they were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground
and it was necessary to keep digging out the packs
the floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher
they tried to eat and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth
they lost the count of time
they dared not sleep for that would have meant being buried alive
the could only crouch close to the leaning rock shake off the sand blindly dig out their packs and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation
the storm finally blew itself out
it left the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep
their burros had wandered away or had been buried in the sand
far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes
away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark
they headed toward it carrying a shovel and part of their packs
at noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert
the prospectors pushed on guided by the sun
in every wash they tried for water
with the forked peach branch in his hands warren always succeeded in locating water
they dug but it lay too deep
at length spent and sore they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day
then they succeeded in getting water and quenched their thirst and filled the canteens and cooked a meal
the burning day found them in an interminably wide plain where there was no shelter from the fierce sun
the men were exceedingly careful with their water though there was absolute necessity of drinking a little every hour
late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found water
for hours they traveled toward its head and long after night had set found what they sought
yielding to exhaustion they slept and next day were loath to leave the waterhole
cool night spurred them on with canteens full and renewed strength
morning told cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert and it was desert new to him
the red sun the increasing heat and especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned cameron that he had descended to a lower level
mountain peaks loomed on all sides some near others distant and one a blue spur splitting the glaring sky far to the north cameron thought he recognized as a landmark
the ascent toward it was heartbreaking not in steepness but in its leagueandleaguelong monotonous rise
cameron knew there was only one hopeto make the water hold out and never stop to rest
warren began to weaken
often he had to halt
the burning white day passed and likewise the night with its white stars shining so pitilessly cold and bright
cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight
evaporation by heat consumed as much as he drank
during one of the rests when he had wetted his parched mouth and throat he found opportunity to pour a little water from his canteen into warren's
at first cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the pace of his elder comrade
but now he felt that he was losing something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the desert
the thought of water came to occupy his mind
he began to imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably diminish
he knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water nevertheless he felt this to be more of fact than fancy and he began to ponder
when next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor but he covertly watched warren
the man appeared far gone yet he had cunning
he cautiously took up cameron's canteen and poured water into it from his own
this troubled cameron
the old irritation at not being able to thwart warren returned to him
cameron reflected and concluded that he had been unwise not to expect this very thing
then as his comrade dropped into weary rest he lifted both canteens
if there were any water in warren's it was only very little
both men had been enduring the terrible desert thirst concealing it each giving his water to the other and the sacrifice had been useless
instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both the water had evaporated
when cameron made sure of this he took one more drink the last and poured the little water left into warren's canteen
he threw his own away
soon afterward warren discovered the loss
where's your canteen
he asked
the heat was getting my water so i drank what was left
my son
said warren
the day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus
like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces
warren went blind from the glare and cameron had to lead him
at last warren plunged down exhausted in the shade of a ledge
cameron rested and waited hopeless with hot weary eyes gazing down from the height where he sat
the ledge was the top step of a ragged gigantic stairway
below stretched a sad austere and lonely valley
a dim wide streak lighter than the bordering gray wound down the valley floor
once a river had flowed there leaving only a forlorn trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley
movement on the part of warren attracted cameron's attention
evidently the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength for he had arisen and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his forked peach branch held before him
he had clung to the precious bit of wood
cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless because he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon and had been filled with sands by desert winds
warren however stopped in a deep pit and cutting his canteen in half began to use one side of it as a scoop
he scooped out a wide hollow so wide that cameron was certain he had gone crazy
cameron gently urged him to stop and then forcibly tried to make him
but these efforts were futile
warren worked with slow ceaseless methodical movement
he toiled for what seemed hours
cameron seeing the darkening dampening sand realized a wonderful possibility of water and he plunged into the pit with the other half of the canteen
then both men toiled round and round the wide hole down deeper and deeper
the sand grew moist then wet
at the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened gave place to gravel
finally water welled in a stronger volume than cameron ever remembered finding on the desert
it would soon fill the hole and run over
he marveled at the circumstance
the time was near the end of the dry season
perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the valley floor and at this point came near to the surface
cameron had heard of such desert miracles
the finding of water revived cameron's flagging hopes
but they were shortlived
warren had spend himself utterly
i'm done
don't linger he whispered
my son gogo
then he fell
cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered place under the ledge
while sitting beside the failing man cameron discovered painted images on the wall
often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people
then from long habit he picked up a piece of rock and examined it
its weight made him closely scrutinize it
the color was a peculiar black
he scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold
around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black weathered rock and pieces of broken ledge and they showed gold
warren
look
see it
feel it
gold
but warren had never cared and now he was too blind to see
gogo
he whispered
cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley and something within him that was neither intelligence nor emotionsomething inscrutably strangeimpelled him to promise
then cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike
that done he tarried beside the unconscious warren
moments passedgrew into hours
cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get out of the desert
but that same inscrutable something which had ordered his strange involuntary promise to warren held him beside his fallen comrade
he watched the white sun turn to gold and then to red and sink behind mountains in the west
twilight stole into the arroyo
it lingered slowly turning to gloom
the vault of blue black lightened to the blinking of stars
then fell the serene silent luminous desert night
cameron kept his vigil
as the long hours wore on he felt creep over him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep
a wan glow flared behind the dark uneven horizon and a melancholy misshapen moon rose to make the white night one of shadows
absolute silence claimed the desert
it was mute
then that inscrutable something breathed to him telling him when he was alone
he need not have looked at the dark still face beside him
another face haunted cameron'sa woman's face
it was there in the white moonlit shadows it drifted in the darkness beyond it softened changed to that of a young girl sweet with the same dark haunting eyes of her mother
cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him the spirit of something deep and mystical as life
he prayed to that nameless thing outside of which the rocks and the sand the spiked cactus and the ragged lava the endless waste with its vast starfired mantle were but atoms
he prayed for mercy to a womanfor happiness to her child
both mother and daughter were close to him then
time and distance were annihilated
he had faithhe saw into the future
the fateful threads of the past so inextricably woven with his error wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert
cameron then took a little tin box from his pocket and opening it removed a folded certificate
he had kept a pen and now he wrote something upon the paper and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood
the moon afforded him enough light to see and having replaced the paper he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock
it would remain there unaffected by dust moisture heat time
how long had those painted images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls
there were no trails in that desert and always there were incalculable changes
cameron saw this mutable mood of naturethe sands would fly and seep and carve and bury the floods would dig and cut the ledges would weather in the heat and rain the avalanches would slide the cactus seeds would roll in the wind to catch in a niche and split the soil with thirsty roots
years would pass
cameron seemed to see them too and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste where she would find love and fortune and the grave of her father
cameron covered the dark still face of his comrade from the light of the waning moon
that action was the severing of his hold on realities
they fell away from him in final separation
vaguely dreamily he seemed to behold his soul
night merged into gray day and night came again weird and dark
then up out of the vast void of the desert from the silence and illimitableness trooped his phantoms of peace
majestically they formed around him marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state and moved to lay upon him their passionless serenity
i  old friends  richard gale reflected that his sojourn in the west had been what his disgusted father had predictedidling here and there with no objective point or purpose
it was reflection such as this only more serious and perhaps somewhat desperate that had brought gale down to the border
for some time the newspapers had been printing news of mexican revolution guerrilla warfare united states cavalry patrolling the international line american cowboys fighting with the rebels and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits
but as opportunity and adventure too had apparently given him a wide berth in montana wyoming colorado he had struck southwest for the arizona border where he hoped to see some stirring life
he did not care very much what happened
months of futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had inclined richard to his father's opinion
it was after dark one evening in early october when richard arrived in casita
he was surprised to find that it was evidently a town of importance
there was a jostling jabbering sombreroed crowd of mexicans around the railroad station
he felt as if he were in a foreign country
after a while he saw several men of his nationality one of whom he engaged to carry his luggage to a hotel
they walked up a wide welllighted street lined with buildings in which were bright windows
of the many people encountered by gale most were mexicans
his guide explained that the smaller half of casita lay in arizona the other half in mexico and of several thousand inhabitants the majority belonged on the southern side of the street which was the boundary line
he also said that rebels had entered the town that day causing a good deal of excitement
gale was almost at the end of his financial resources which fact occasioned him to turn away from a pretentious hotel and to ask his guide for a cheaper lodginghouse
when this was found a sight of the loungers in the office and also a desire for comfort persuaded gale to change his travelingclothes for rough outing garb and boots
well i'm almost broke he soliloquized thoughtfully
the governor said i wouldn't make any money
he's rightso far
and he said i'd be coming home beaten
there he's wrong
i've got a hunch that something 'll happen to me in this greaser town
he went out into a wide whitewashed highceiled corridor and from that into an immense room which but for pool tables bar benches would have been like a courtyard
the floor was cobblestoned the walls were of adobe and the large windows opened like doors
a blue cloud of smoke filled the place
gale heard the click of pool balls and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar
barelegged sandalfooted mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with mexicans mantled in black and red
there were others in tightfitting blue uniforms with gold fringe or tassels at the shoulders
these men wore belts with heavy bonehandled guns and evidently were the rurales or native policemen
there were blackbearded coarsevisaged americans some gambling round the little tables others drinking
the pool tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men several of whom were unsteady on their feet
there were khakiclad cavalrymen strutting in and out
at one end of the room somewhat apart from the general meelee was a group of six men round a little table four of whom were seated the other two standing
these last two drew a second glance from gale
the sharpfeatured bronzed faces and piercing eyes the tall slender loosely jointed bodies the quiet easy reckless air that seemed to be a part of the menthese things would plainly have stamped them as cowboys without the buckled sombreros the colored scarfs the hightopped highheeled boots with great silverroweled spurs
gale did not fail to note also that these cowboys wore guns and this fact was rather a shock to his idea of the modern west
it caused him to give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border and he felt a thrill
he satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining and as he stepped back into the saloon a man wearing a military cape jostled him
apologies from both were instant
gale was moving on when the other stopped short as if startled and leaning forward exclaimed  dick gale
you've got me replied gale in surprise
but i don't know you
he could not see the stranger's face because it was wholly shaded by a widebrimmed hat pulled well down
by jove
it's dick
if this isn't great
don't you know me
i've heard your voice somewhere replied gale
maybe i'll recognize you if you come out from under that bonnet
for answer the man suddenly manifesting thought of himself hurriedly drew gale into the restaurant where he thrust back his hat to disclose a handsome sunburned face
george thorne
so help me  'ssssh
you needn't yell interrupted the other as he met gale's outstretched hand
there was a close hard straining grip
i must not be recognized here
there are reasons
i'll explain in a minute
say but it's fine to see you
five years dick five years since i saw you run down university field and spreadeagle the whole wisconsin football team
don't recollect that replied dick laughing
george i'll bet you i'm gladder to see you than you are to see me
it seems so long
you went into the army didn't you
i did
i'm here now with the ninth cavalry
butnever mind me
what're you doing way down here
say i just noticed your togs
dick you can't be going in for mining or ranching not in this godforsaken desert
on the square george i don't know any more why i'm here thanthan you know
well that beats me
ejaculated thorne sitting back in his chair amaze and concern in his expression
what the devil's wrong
your old man's got too much money for you ever to be up against it
dick you couldn't have gone to the bad
a tide of emotion surged over gale
how good it was to meet a friendsome one to whom to talk
he had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment
george how i ever drifted down here i don't know
i didn't exactly quarrel with the governor
butdamn it dad hurt meshamed me and i dug out for the west
it was this way
after leaving college i tried to please him by tackling one thing after another that he set me to do
on the square i had no head for business
i made a mess of everything
the governor got sore
he kept ramming the harpoon into me till i just couldn't stand it
what little ability i possessed deserted me when i got my back up and there you are
dad and i had a rather uncomfortable half hour
when i quitwhen i told him straight out that i was going west to fare for myself why it wouldn't have been so tough if he hadn't laughed at me
he called me a rich man's sonan idle easygoing spineless swell
he said i didn't even have character enough to be out and out bad
he said i didn't have sense enough to marry one of the nice girls in my sister's crowd
he said i couldn't get back home unless i sent to him for money
he said he didn't believe i could fightcould really make a fight for anything under the sun
ohhehe shot it into me all right
dick dropped his head upon his hands somewhat ashamed of the smarting dimness in his eyes
he had not meant to say so much
yet what a relief to let out that longcongested burden
fight
cried thorne hotly
what's ailing him
didn't they call you biff gale in college
dick you were one of the best men stagg ever developed
i heard him say sothat you were the fastest onehundredandseventyfivepound man he'd ever trained the hardest to stop
the governor didn't count football said dick
he didn't mean that kind of fight
when i left home i don't think i had an idea what was wrong with me
but george i think i know now
i was a rich man's sonspoiled dependent absolutely ignorant of the value of money
i haven't yet discovered any earning capacity in me
i seem to be unable to do anything with my hands
that's the trouble
but i'm at the end of my tether now
and i'm going to punch cattle or be a miner or do some real stuntlike joining the rebels
aha
i thought you'd spring that last one on me declared thorne wagging his head
well you just forget it
say old boy there's something doing in mexico
the united states in general doesn't realize it
but across that line there are crazy revolutionists illpaid soldiers guerrilla leaders raiders robbers outlaws bandits galore starving peons by the thousand girls and women in terror
mexico is like some of her volcanoesready to erupt fire and hell
don't make the awful mistake of joining rebel forces
americans are hated by mexicans of the lower classthe fighting class both rebel and federal
half the time these crazy greasers are on one side then on the other
if you didn't starve or get shot in ambush or die of thirst some greaser would knife you in the back for you belt buckle or boots
there are a good many americans with the rebels eastward toward agua prieta and juarez
orozco is operating in chihuahua and i guess he has some idea of warfare
but this is sonora a mountainous desert the home of the slave and the yaqui
there's unorganized revolt everywhere
the american miners and ranchers those who could get away have fled across into the states leaving property
those who couldn't or wouldn't come must fight for their lives are fighting now
that's bad said gale
it's news to me
why doesn't the government take action do something
afraid of international complications
don't want to offend the maderists or be criticized by jealous foreign nations
it's a delicate situation dick
the washington officials know the gravity of it you can bet
but the united states in general is in the dark and the armywell you ought to hear the inside talk back at san antonio
we're patrolling the boundary line
we're making a grand bluff
i could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued raiders on the other side of the line
but we won't do it
the officers are a grouchy lot these days
you see of course what significance would attach to united states cavalry going into mexican territory
there would simply be hell
my own colonel is the sorest man on the job
we're all sore
it's like sitting on a powder magazine
we can't keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line
yet we don't fight
my commission expires soon
i'll be discharged in three months
you can bet i'm glad for more reasons than i've mentioned
thorne was evidently laboring under strong suppressed excitement
his face showed pale under the tan and his eyes gleamed with a dark fire
occasionally his delight at meeting talking with gale dominated the other emotions but not for long
he had seated himself at a table near one of the doorlike windows leading into the street and every little while he would glance sharply out
also he kept consulting his watch
these details gradually grew upon gale as thorne talked
george it strikes me that you're upset said dick presently
i seem to remember you as a coolheaded fellow whom nothing could disturb
has the army changed you
thorne laughed
it was a laugh with a strange high note
it was recklessit hinted of exaltation
he rose abruptly he gave the waiter money to go for drinks he looked into the saloon and then into the street
on this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches
thorne peered out one window then another
his actions were rapid
returning to the table he put his hands upon it and leaned over to look closely into gale's face
i'm away from camp without leave he said
isn't that a serious offense
asked dick
serious
for me if i'm discovered it means ruin
there are rebels in town
any moment we might have trouble
i ought to be ready for dutywithin call
if i'm discovered it means arrest
that means delaythe failure of my plansruin
gale was silenced by his friend's intensity
thorne bent over closer with his dark eyes searching bright
we were old palsonce
surely replied dick
what would you say dick gale if i told you that you're the one man i'd rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life
the earnest gaze the passionate voice with its deep tremor drew dick upright thrilling and eager conscious of strange unfamiliar impetuosity
thorne i should say i was glad to be the fellow replied dick
their hands locked for a moment and they sat down again with heads close over the table
listen began thorne in low swift whisper a few days a week agoit seems like a yeari was of some assistance to refugees fleeing from mexico into the states
they were all women and one of them was dressed as a nun
quite by accident i saw her face
it was that of a beautiful girl
i observed she kept aloof from the others
i suspected a disguise and when opportunity afforded spoke to her offered my services
she replied to my poor efforts at spanish in fluent english
she had fled in terror from her home some place down in sinaloa
rebels are active there
her father was captured and held for ransom
when the ransom was paid the rebels killed him
the leader of these rebels was a bandit named rojas
long before the revolution began he had been feared by people of classloved by the peons
bandits are worshiped by the peons
all of the famous bandits have robbed the rich and given to the poor
rojas saw the daughter made off with her
but she contrived to bribe her guards and escaped almost immediately before any harm befell her
she hid among friends
rojas nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her
then she disguised herself and traveled by horseback stage and train to casita
her story fascinated me and that one fleeting glimpse i had of her face i couldn't forget
she had no friends here no money
she knew rojas was trailing her
this talk i had with her was at the railroad station where all was bustle and confusion
no one noticed us so i thought
i advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left the waitingroom
and i got a boy to guide her
but he fetched her to his house
i had promised to come in the evening to talk over the situation with her
i found her dick and when i saw heri went stark staring raving mad over her
she is the most beautiful wonderful girl i ever saw
her name is mercedes castaneda and she belongs to one of the old wealthy spanish families
she has lived abroad and in havana
she speaks french as well as english
she isbut i must be brief
dick think think
with mercedes also it was love at first sight
my plan is to marry her and get her farther to the interior away from the border
it may not be easy
she's watched
so am i
it was impossible to see her without the women of this house knowing
at first perhaps they had only curiosityan itch to gossip
but the last two days there has been a change
since last night there's some powerful influence at work
oh these mexicans are subtle mysterious
after all they are spaniards
they work in secret in the dark
they are dominated first by religion then by gold then by passion for a woman
rojas must have got word to his friends here yesterday his gang of cutthroat rebels arrived and today he came
when i learned that i took my chance and left camp
i hunted up a priest
he promised to come here
it's time he's due
but i'm afraid he'll be stopped
thorne why don't you take the girl and get married without waiting without running these risks
said dick
i fear it's too late now
i should have done that last night
you see we're over the line  are we in mexican territory now
queried gale sharply
i guess yes old boy
that's what complicates it
rojas and his rebels have casita in their hands
but rojas without his rebels would be able to stop me get the girl and make for his mountain haunts
if mercedes is really watchedif her identity is known which i am sure is the casewe couldn't get far from this house before i'd be knifed and she seized
good heavens
thorne can that sort of thing happen less than a stone's throw from the united states line
asked gale incredulously
it can happen and don't you forget it
you don't seem to realize the power these guerrilla leaders these rebel captains and particularly these bandits exercise over the mass of mexicans
a bandit is a man of honor in mexico
he is feared envied loved
in the hearts of the people he stands next to the national idolthe bullfighter the matador
the race has a wild barbarian bloody strain
take quinteros for instance
he was a peon a slave
he became a famous bandit
at the outbreak of the revolution he proclaimed himself a leader and with a band of followers he devastated whole counties
the opposition to federal forces was only a blind to rob and riot and carry off women
the motto of this man and his followers was  'let us enjoy ourselves while we may'
there are other bandits besides quinteros not so famous or such great leaders but just as bloodthirsty
i've seen rojas
he's a handsome bold sneering devil vainer than any peacock
he decks himself in gold lace and sliver trappings in all the finery he can steal
he was one of the rebels who helped sack sinaloa and carry off half a million in money and valuables
rojas spends gold like he spills blood
but he is chiefly famous for abducting women
the peon girls consider it an honor to be ridden off with
rojas has shown a penchant for girls of the better class
thorne wiped the perspiration from his pale face and bent a dark gaze out of the window before he resumed his talk
consider what the position of mercedes really is
i can't get any help from our side of the line
if so i don't know where
the population on that side is mostly mexican absolutely in sympathy with whatever actuates those on this side
the whole caboodle of greasers on both sides belong to the class in sympathy with the rebels the class that secretly respects men like rojas and hates an aristocrat like mercedes
they would conspire to throw her into his power
rojas can turn all the hidden underground influences to his ends
unless i thwart him he'll get mercedes as easily as he can light a cigarette
but i'll kill him or some of his gang or her before i let him get her
this is the situation old friend
i've little time to spare
i face arrest for desertion
rojas is in town
i think i was followed to this hotel
the priest has betrayed me or has been stopped
mercedes is here alone waiting absolutely dependent upon me to save her fromfrom  she's the sweetest loveliest girl
in a few momentssooner or later there'll be hell here
dick are you with me
dick gale drew a long deep breath
a coldness a lethargy an indifference that had weighed upon him for months had passed out of his being
on the instant he could not speak but his hand closed powerfully upon his friend's
thorne's face changed wonderfully the distress the fear the appeal all vanishing in a smile of passionate gratefulness
then dick's gaze attracted by some slight sound shot over his friend's shoulder to see a face at the windowa handsome bold sneering face with glittering dark eyes that flashed in sinister intentness
dick stiffened in his seat
thorne with sudden clenching of hands wheeled toward the window
rojas
he whispered
ii  mercedes castaneda  the dark face vanished
dick gale heard footsteps and the tinkle of spurs
he strode to the window and was in time to see a mexican swagger into the front door of the saloon
dick had only a glimpse but in that he saw a huge black sombrero with a gaudy band the back of a short tightfitting jacket a heavy pearlhandled gun swinging with a fringe of sash and closefitting trousers spreading wide at the bottom
there were men passing in the street also several mexicans lounging against the hitchingrail at the curb
did you see him
where did he go
whispered thorne as he joined gale
those greasers out there with the cartridge belts crossed over their breaststhey are rebels
i think he went into the saloon replied dick
he had a gun but for all i can see the greasers out there are unarmed
never believe it
there
look dick
that fellow's a guard though he seems so unconcerned
see he has a short carbine almost concealed
there's another greaser farther down the path
i'm afraid rojas has the house spotted
if we could only be sure
i'm sure dick
let's cross the hall i want to see how it looks from the other side of the house
gale followed thorne out of the restaurant into the highceiled corridor which evidently divided the hotel opening into the street and running back to a patio
a few dim yellow lamps flickered
a mexican with a blanket round his shoulders stood in the front entrance
back toward the patio there were sounds of boots on the stone floor
shadows flitted across that end of the corridor
thorne entered a huge chamber which was even more poorly lighted than the hall
it contained a table littered with papers a few highbacked chairs a couple of couches and was evidently a parlor
mercedes has been meeting me here said thorne
at this hour she comes every moment or so to the head of the stairs there and if i am here she comes down
mostly there are people in this room a little later
we go out into the plaza
it faces the dark side of the house and that's the place i must slip out with her if there's any chance at all to get away
they peered out of the open window
the plaza was gloomy and at first glance apparently deserted
in a moment however gale made out a slowpacing dark form on the path
farther down there was another
no particular keenness was required to see in these forms a sentinellike stealthiness
gripping gale's arm thorne pulled back from the window
you saw them he whispered
it's just as i feared
rojas has the place surrounded
i should have taken mercedes away
but i had no timeno chance
i'm bound
there's mercedes now
my god
dick thinkthink if there's a way to get her out of this trap
gale turned as his friend went down the room
in the dim light at the head of the stairs stood the slim muffled figure of a woman
when she saw thorne she flew noiselessly down the stairway to him
he caught her in his arms
then she spoke softly brokenly in a low swift voice
it was a mingling of incoherent spanish and english but to gale it was mellow deep unutterably tender a voice full of joy fear passion hope and love
upon gale it had an unaccountable effect
he found himself thrilling wondering
thorne led the girl to the center of the room under the light where gale stood
she had raised a white hand holding a blacklaced mantilla half aside
dick saw a small dark head proudly held an oval face half hidden white as a flower and magnificent black eyes
then thorne spoke
mercedesdick gale an old friendthe best friend i ever had
she swept the mantilla back over her head disclosing a lovely face strange and striking to gale in its pride and fire its intensity
senor galeah
i cannot speak my happiness
his friend
yes mercedes my friend and yours said thorne speaking rapidly
we'll have need of him
dear there's bad news and no time to break it gently
the priest did not come
he must have been detained
and listenbe brave dear mercedesrojas is here
she uttered an inarticulate cry the poignant terror of which shook gale's nerve and swayed as if she would faint
thorne caught her and in husky voice importuned her to bear up
my darling
for god's sake don't faintdon't go to pieces
we'd be lost
we've got a chance
we'll think of something
be strong
fight
it was plain to gale that thorne was distracted
he scarcely knew what he was saying
pale and shaking he clasped mercedes to him
her terror had struck him helpless
it was so intenseit was so full of horrible certainty of what fate awaited her
she cried out in spanish beseeching him and as he shook his head she changed to english  senor my lover i will be strongi will fighti will obey
but swear by my virgin if need be to save me from rojasyou will kill me
mercedes
yes i'll swear he replied hoarsely
i knowi'd rather have you dead than but don't give up
rojas can't be sure of you or he wouldn't wait
he's in there
he's got his men thereall around us
but he hesitates
a beast like rojas doesn't stand idle for nothing
i tell you we've a chance
dick here will think of something
we'll slip away
then he'll take you somewhere
onlyspeak to himshow him you won't weaken
mercedes this is more than love and happiness for us
it's life or death
she became quiet and slowly recovered control of herself
suddenly she wheeled to face gale with proud dark eyes tragic sweetness of appeal and exquisite grace
senor you are an american
you cannot know the spanish bloodthe peon bandit's hate and cruelty
i wish to die before rojas's hand touches me
if he takes me alive then the hour the little day that my life lasts afterward will be torturedtorture of hell
if i live two days his brutal men will have me
if i live three the dogs of his camp senor have you a sister whom you love
help senor thorne to save me
he is a soldier
he is bound
he must not betray his honor his duty for me ah you two splendid americansso big so strong so fierce
what is that little black halfbreed slave rojas to such men
rojas is a coward
now let me waste no more precious time
i am ready
i will be brave
she came close to gale holding out her white hands a woman all fire and soul and passion
to gale she was wonderful
his heart leaped
as he bent over her hands and kissed them he seemed to feel himself renewed remade
senorita he said i am happy to be your servant
i can conceive of no greater pleasure than giving the service you require
and what is that
inquired thorne hurriedly
that of incapacitating senor rojas for tonight and perhaps several nights to come replied gale
dick what will you do
asked thorne now in alarm
i'll make a row in that saloon returned dick bluntly
i'll start something
i'll rush rojas and his crowd
i'll  lord no you mustn't dickyou'll be knifed
cried thorne
he was in distress yet his eyes were shining
i'll take a chance
maybe i can surprise that slow greaser bunch and get away before they know what's happened you be ready watching at the window
when the row starts those fellows out there in the plaza will run into the saloon
then you slip out go straight through the plaza down the street
it's a dark street i remember
i'll catch up with you before you get far
thorne gasped but did not say a word
mercedes leaned against him her white hands now at her breast her great eyes watching gale as he went out
in the corridor gale stopped long enough to pull on a pair of heavy gloves to muss his hair and disarrange his collar
then he stepped into the restaurant went through and halted in the door leading into the saloon
his five feet eleven inches and one hundred and eighty pounds were more noticeable there and it was part of his plan to attract attention to himself
no one however appeared to notice him
the poolplayers were noisily intent on their game the same crowd of motleyrobed mexicans hung over the reeking bar
gale's roving glance soon fixed upon the man he took to be rojas
he recognized the huge highpeaked black sombrero with its ornamented band
the mexican's face was turned aside
he was in earnest excited colloquy with a dozen or more comrades most of whom were sitting round a table
they were listening talking drinking
the fact that they wore cartridge belts crossed over their breasts satisfied that these were the rebels
he had noted the belts of the mexicans outside who were apparently guards
a waiter brought more drinks to this group at the table and this caused the leader to turn so gale could see his face
it was indeed the sinister sneering face of the bandit rojas
gale gazed at the man with curiosity
he was under medium height and striking in appearance only because of his dandified dress and evil visage
he wore a lace scarf a tight brightbuttoned jacket a buckskin vest embroidered in red a sash and belt joined by an enormous silver clasp
gale saw again the pearlhandled gun swinging at the bandit's hip
jewels flashed in his scarf
there were gold rings in his ears and diamonds on his fingers
gale became conscious of an inward fire that threatened to overrun his coolness
other emotions harried his selfcontrol
it seemed as if sight of the man liberated or created a devil in gale
and at the bottom of his feelings there seemed to be a wonder at himself a strange satisfaction for the something that had come to him
he stepped out of the doorway down the couple of steps to the floor of the saloon and he staggered a little simulating drunkenness
he fell over the pool tables jostled mexicans at the bar laughed like a maudlin fool and with his hat slouched down crowded here and there
presently his eye caught sight of the group of cowboys whom he had before noticed with such interest
they were still in a corner somewhat isolated
with fertile mind working gale lurched over to them
he remembered his many unsuccessful attempts to get acquainted with cowboys
if he were to get any help from these silent aloof rangers it must be by striking fire from them in one swift stroke
planting himself squarely before the two tall cowboys who were standing he looked straight into their lean bronzed faces
he spared a full moment for that keen cool gaze before he spoke
i'm not drunk
i'm throwing a bluff and i mean to start a rough house
i'm going to rush that damned bandit rojas
it's to save a girlto give her lover who is my friend a chance to escape with her
when i start a row my friend will try to slip out with her
every door and window is watched
i've got to raise hell to draw the guards in well you're my countrymen
we're in mexico
a beautiful girl's honor and life are at stake
now gentlemen watch me
one cowboy's eyes narrowed blinking a little and his lean jaw dropped the other's hard face rippled with a fleeting smile
gale backed away and his pulse leaped when he saw the two cowboys as if with one purpose slowly stride after him
then gale swerved staggering along brushed against the tables kicked over the empty chairs
he passed rojas and his gang and out of the tail of his eye saw that the bandit was watching him waving his hands and talking fiercely
the hum of the many voices grew louder and when dick lurched against a table overturning it and spilling glasses into the laps of several mexicans there arose a shrill cry
he had succeeded in attracting attention almost every face turned his way
one of the insulted men a little tawny fellow leaped up to confront gale and in a frenzy screamed a volley of spanish of which gale distinguished gringo
the mexican stamped and made a threatening move with his right hand
dick swung his leg and with a swift side kick knocked the fellows feet from under him whirling him down with a thud
the action was performed so suddenly so adroitly it made the mexican such a weakling so like a tumbled tenpin that the shrill jabbering hushed
gale knew this to be the significant moment
wheeling he rushed at rojas
it was his old linebreaking plunge
neither rojas nor his men had time to move
the blackskinned bandit's face turned a dirty white his jaw dropped he would have shrieked if gale had not hit him
the blow swept him backward against his men
then gale's heavy body swiftly following with the momentum of that rush struck the little group of rebels
they went down with table and chairs in a sliding crash
gale carried by his plunge went with them
like a cat he landed on top
as he rose his powerful hands fastened on rojas
he jerked the little bandit off the tangled pile of struggling yelling men and swinging him with terrific force let go his hold
rojas slid along the floor knocking over tables and chairs
gale bounded back dragged rojas up handling him as if he were a limp sack
a shot rang out above the yells
gale heard the jingle of breaking glass
the room darkened perceptibly
he flashed a glance backward
the two cowboys were between him and the crowd of frantic rebels
one cowboy held two guns low down level in front of him
the other had his gun raised and aimed
on the instant it spouted red and white
with the crack came the crashing of glass another darkening shade over the room
with a cry gale slung the bleeding rojas from him
the bandit struck a table toppled over it fell and lay prone
another shot made the room full of moving shadows with light only back of the bar
a whiteclad figure rushed at gale
he tripped the man but had to kick hard to disengage himself from grasping hands
another figure closed in on gale
this one was dark swift
a blade glinteddescribed a circle aloft
simultaneously with a close red flash the knife wavered the man wielding it stumbled backward
in the din gale did not hear a report but the mexican's fall was significant
then pandemonium broke loose
the din became a roar
gale heard shots that sounded like dull spats in the distance
the big lamp behind the bar seemingly split then sputtered and went out leaving the room in darkness
gale leaped toward the restaurant door which was outlined faintly by the yellow light within
right and left he pushed the groping men who jostled with him
he vaulted a pool table sent tables and chairs flying and gained the door to be the first of a wedging mob to squeeze through
one sweep of his arm knocked the restaurant lamp from its stand and he ran out leaving darkness behind him
a few bounds took him into the parlor
it was deserted
thorne had gotten away with mercedes
it was then gale slowed up
for the space of perhaps sixty seconds he had been moving with startling velocity
he peered cautiously out into the plaza
the paths the benches the shady places under the trees contained no skulking men
he ran out keeping to the shade and did not go into the path till he was halfway through the plaza
under a street lamp at the far end of the path he thought he saw two dark figures
he ran faster and soon reached the street
the uproar back in the hotel began to diminish or else he was getting out of hearing
the few people he saw close at hand were all coming his way and only the foremost showed any excitement
gale walked swiftly peering ahead for two figures
presently he saw themone tall wearing a cape the other slight mantled
gale drew a sharp breath of relief
thorne and mercedes were not far ahead
from time to time thorne looked back
he strode swiftly almost carrying mercedes who clung closely to him
she too looked back
once gale saw her white face flash in the light of a street lamp
he began to overhaul them and soon when the last lamp had been passed and the street was dark he ventured a whistle
thorne heard it for he turned whistled a low reply and went on
not for some distance beyond where the street ended in open country did they halt to wait
the desert began here
gale felt the soft sand under his feet and saw the grotesque forms of cactus
then he came up with the fugitives
dick
are youall right
panted thorne grasping gale
i'mout of breathbutok replied gale
good
good
choked thorne
i was scaredhelpless dick it worked splendidly
we had no trouble
what on earth did you do
i made the row all right said dick
good heavens
it was like a row i once heard made by a mob
but the shots dickwere they at you
they paralyzed me
then the yells
what happened
those guards of rojas ran round in front at the first shot
tell me what happened
while i was rushing rojas a couple of cowboys shot out the lamplights
a mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt i guess
then i think there was some shooting from the rebels after the room was dark
rushing rojas
queried thorne leaning close to dick
his voice was thrilling exultant deep with a joy that yet needed confirmation
what did you do to him
i handed him one off side tackled then tried a forward pass replied dick lightly speaking the football vernacular so familiar to thorne
thorne leaned closer his fine face showing fierce and corded in the starlight
tell me straight he demanded in thick voice
gale then divined something of the suffering thorne had undergonesomething of the hot wild vengeful passion of a lover who must have brutal truth
it stilled dick's lighter mood and he was about to reply when mercedes pressed close to him touched his hands looked up into his face with wonderful eyes
he thought he would not soon forget their beautythe shadow of pain that had been the hope dawning so fugitively
dear lady said gale with voice not wholly steady rojas himself will hound you no more tonight nor for many nights
she seemed to shake to thrill to rise with the intelligence
she pressed his hand close over her heaving breast
gale felt the quick throb of her heart
senor
senor dick
she cried
then her voice failed
but her hands flew up quick as a flash she raised her facekissed him
then she turned and with a sob fell into thorne's arms
there ensued a silence broken only by mercedes' sobbing
gale walked some paces away
if he were not stunned he certainly was agitated
the strange sweet fire of that girl's lips remained with him
on the spur of the moment he imagined he had a jealousy of thorne
but presently this passed
it was only that he had been deeply movedstirred to the depths during the last hourhad become conscious of the awakening of a spirit
what remained with him now was the splendid glow of gladness that he had been of service to thorne
and by the intensity of mercedes' abandon of relief and gratitude he measured her agony of terror and the fate he had spared her
dick dick come here
called thorne softly
let's pull ourselves together now
we've got a problem yet
what to do
where to go
how to get any place
we don't dare risk the stationthe corrals where mexicans hire out horses
we're on good old us ground this minute but we're not out of danger
as he paused evidently hoping for a suggestion from gale the silence was broken by the clear ringing peal of a bugle
thorne gave a violent start
then he bent over listening
the beautiful notes of the bugle floated out of the darkness clearer sharper faster
it's a call dick
it's a call
he cried
gale had no answer to make
mercedes stood as if stricken
the bugle call ended
from a distance another faintly pealed
there were other sounds too remote to recognize
then scattering shots rattled out
dick the rebels are fighting somebody burst out thorne excitedly
the little federal garrison still holds its stand
perhaps it is attacked again
anyway there's something doing over the line
maybe the crazy greasers are firing on our camp
we've feared itin the dark and here i am away without leavepractically a deserter
go back
go back before you're too late
cried mercedes
better make tracks thorne added gale
it can't help our predicament for you to be arrested
i'll take care of mercedes
no no no replied thorne
i can get awayavoid arrest
that'd be all right for the immediate present
but it's not best for the future
george a deserter is a deserter
better hurry
leave the girl to me till tomorrow
mercedes embraced her lover begged him to go
thorne wavered
dick i'm up against it he said
you're right
if only i can get back in time
but oh i hate to leave her
old fellow you've saved her
i already owe you everlasting gratitude
keep out of casita dick
the us side might be safe but i'm afraid to trust it at night
go out in the desert up in the mountains in some safe place
then come to me in camp
we'll plan
i'll have to confide in colonel weede
maybe he'll help us
hide her from the rebelsthat's all
he wrung dick's hand clasped mercedes tightly in his arms kissed her and murmured low over her then released her to rush off into the darkness
he disappeared in the gloom
the sound of his dull footfalls gradually died away
for a moment the desert silence oppressed gale
he was unaccustomed to such strange stillness
there was a low stir of sand a rustle of stiff leaves in the wind
how white the stars burned
then a coyote barked to be bayed by a dog
gale realized that he was between the edge of an unknown desert and the edge of a hostile town
he had to choose the desert because though he had no doubt that in casita there were many americans who might befriend him he could not chance the risks of seeking them at night
he felt a slight touch on his arm felt it move down felt mercedes slip a trembling cold little hand into his
dick looked at her
she seemed a whitefaced girl now with staring frightened black eyes that flashed up at him
if the loneliness the silence the desert the unknown dangers of the night affected him what must they be to this hunted driven girl
gale's heart swelled
he was alone with her
he had no weapon no money no food no drink no covering nothing except his two hands
he had absolutely no knowledge of the desert of the direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics he did not know where to find the railroad or any road or trail or whether or not there were towns near or far
it was a critical desperate situation
he thought first of the girl and groaned in spirit prayed that it would be given him to save her
when he remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this onewhere fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend to a helpless girl
senor senor
suddenly whispered mercedes clinging to him
listen
i hear horses coming
iii  a flight into the desert  uneasy and startled gale listened and hearing nothing wondered if mercedes's fears had not worked upon her imagination
he felt a trembling seize her and he held her hands tightly
you were mistaken i guess he whispered
no no senor
dick turned his ear to the soft wind
presently he heard or imagined he heard low beats
like the first faint faroff beats of a drumming grouse they recalled to him the illinois forests of his boyhood
in a moment he was certain the sounds were the padlike steps of hoofs in yielding sand
the regular tramp was not that of grazing horses
on the instant made cautious and stealthy by alarm gale drew mercedes deeper into the gloom of the shrubbery
sharp pricks from thorns warned him that he was pressing into a cactus growth and he protected mercedes as best he could
she was shaking as one with a severe chill
she breathed with little hurried pants and leaned upon him almost in collapse
gale ground his teeth in helpless rage at the girl's fate
if she had not been beautiful she might still have been free and happy in her home
what a strange world to live inhow unfair was fate
the sounds of hoofbeats grew louder
gale made out a dark moving mass against a background of dull gray
there was a line of horses
he could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders
the murmur of a voice struck his earthen a low laugh
it made him tingle for it sounded american
eagerly he listened
there was an interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard
it shore was laddy it shore was came a voice out of the darkness
rough house
laddy since wire fences drove us out of texas we ain't seen the like of that
an' we never had such a call
call
it was a burnin' roast replied another voice
i felt low down
he vamoosed some sudden an' i hope he an' his friends shook the dust of casita
that's a rotten town jim
gale jumped up in joy
what luck
the speakers were none other than the two cowboys whom he had accosted in the mexican hotel
hold on fellows he called out and strode into the road
the horses snorted and stamped
then followed swift rustling soundsa clinking of spurs then silence
the figures loomed clearer in the gloom gale saw five or six horses two with riders and one other at least carrying a pack
when gale got within fifteen feet of the group the foremost horseman said  i reckon that's close enough stranger
something in the cowboy's hand glinted darkly bright in the starlight
you'd recognize me if it wasn't so dark replied gale halting
i spoke to you a little while agoin the saloon back there
come over an' let's see you said the cowboy curtly
gale advanced till he was close to the horse
the cowboy leaned over the saddle and peered into gale's face
then without a word he sheathed the gun and held out his hand
gale met a grip of steel that warmed his blood
the other cowboy got off his nervous spirited horse and threw the bridle
he too peered closely into gale's face
my name's ladd he said
reckon i'm some glad to meet you again
gale felt another grip as hard and strong as the other had been
he realized he had found friends who belonged to a class of men whom he had despaired of ever knowing
galedick gale is my name he began swiftly
i dropped into casita tonight hardly knowing where i was
a boy took me to that hotel
there i met an old friend whom i had not seen for years
he belongs to the cavalry stationed here
he had befriended a spanish girlfallen in love with her
rojas had killed this girl's fathertried to abduct her you know what took place at the hotel
gentlemen if it's ever possible i'll show you how i appreciate what you did for me there
i got away found my friend with the girl
we hurried out here beyond the edge of town
then thorne had to make a break for camp
we heard bugle calls shots and he was away without leave
that left the girl with me
i don't know what to do
thorne swears casita is no place for mercedes at night
the girl ain't no peon no common greaser
interrupted ladd
no
her name is castaneda
she belongs to an old spanish family once rich and influential
reckoned as much replied the cowboy
there's more than rojas's wantin' to kidnap a pretty girl
shore he does that every day or so
must be somethin' political or feelin' against class
well casita ain't no place for your friend's girl at night or day or any time
shore there's americans who'd take her in an' fight for her if necessary
but it ain't wise to risk that
lash what do you say
it's been gettin' hotter round this greaser corral for some weeks replied the other cowboy
if that twobit of a garrison surrenders there's no tellin' what'll happen
orozco is headin' west from agua prieta with his guerrillas
campo is burnin' bridges an' tearin' up the railroad south of nogales
then there's all these bandits callin' themselves revolutionists just for an excuse to steal burn kill an' ride off with women
it's plain facts laddy an' bein' across the us line a few inches or so don't make no hell of a difference
my advice is don't let miss castaneda ever set foot in casita again
looks like you've shore spoke sense said ladd
i reckon gale you an' the girl ought to come with us
casita shore would be a little warm for us tomorrow
we didn't kill anybody but i shot a greaser's arm off an' lash strained friendly relations by destroyin' property
we know people who'll take care of the senorita till your friend can come for her
dick warmly spoke his gratefulness and inexpressibly relieved and happy for mercedes he went toward the clump of cactus where he had left her
she stood erect waiting and dark as it was he could tell she had lost the terror that had so shaken her
senor gale you are my good angel she said tremulously
i've been lucky to fall in with these men and i'm glad with all my heart he replied
come
he led her into the road up to the cowboys who now stood bareheaded in the starlight
they seemed shy and lash was silent while ladd made embarrassed unintelligible reply to mercedes's thanks
there were five horsestwo saddled two packed and the remaining one carried only a blanket
ladd shortened the stirrups on his mount and helped mercedes up into the saddle
from the way she settled herself and took the few restive prances of the mettlesome horse gale judged that she could ride
lash urged gale to take his horse
but this gale refused to do
i'll walk he said
i'm used to walking
i know cowboys are not
they tried again to persuade him without avail
then ladd started off riding bareback
mercedes fell in behind with gale walking beside her
the two pack animals came next and lash brought up the rear
once started with protection assured for the girl and a real objective point in view gale relaxed from the tense strain he had been laboring under
how glad he would have been to acquaint thorne with their good fortune
later of course there would be some way to get word to the cavalryman
but till then what torments his friend would suffer
it seemed to dick that a very long time had elapsed since he stepped off the train and one by one he went over every detail of incident which had occurred between that arrival and the present moment
strange as the facts were he had no doubts
he realized that before that night he had never known the deeps of wrath undisturbed in him he had never conceived even a passing idea that it was possible for him to try to kill a man
his right hand was swollen stiff so sore that he could scarcely close it
his knuckles were bruised and bleeding and ached with a sharp pain
considering the thickness of his heavy glove gale was of the opinion that so to bruise his hand he must have struck rojas a powerful blow
he remembered that for him to give or take a blow had been nothing
this blow to rojas however had been a different matter
the hot wrath which had been his motive was not puzzling but the effect on him after he had cooled off a subtle difference something puzzled and eluded him
the more it baffled him the more he pondered
all those wandering months of his had been filled with dissatisfaction yet he had been too apathetic to understand himself
so he had not been much of a person to try
perhaps it had not been the blow to rojas any more than other things that had wrought some change in him
his meeting with thorne the wonderful black eyes of a spanish girl her appeal to him the hate inspired by rojas and the rush the blow the action sight of thorne and  mercedes hurrying safely away the girl's hand pressing his to her heaving breast the sweet fire of her kiss the fact of her being alone with him dependent upon himall these things gale turned over and over in his mind only to fail of any definite conclusion as to which had affected him so remarkably or to tell what had really happened to him
had he fallen in love with thorne's sweetheart
the idea came in a flash
was he all in an instant and by one of those incomprehensible reversals of  character jealous of his friend
dick was almost afraid to look up at mercedes
still he forced himself to do so and as it chanced mercedes was looking down at him
somehow the light was better and he clearly saw her white face her black and starry eyes her perfect mouth
with a quick graceful impulsiveness she put her hand upon his shoulder
like her appearance the action was new strange striking to gale but it brought home suddenly to him the nature of gratitude and affection in a girl of her blood
it was sweet and sisterly
he knew then that he had not fallen in love with her
the feeling that was akin to jealousy seemed to be of the beautiful something for which mercedes stood in thorne's life
gale then grasped the bewildering possibilities the infinite wonder of what a girl could mean to a man
the other haunting intimations of change seemed to be elusively blended with sensationsthe heat and thrill of action the sense of something done and more to do the utter vanishing of an old weary hunt for he knew not what
maybe it had been a hunt for work for energy for spirit for love for his real self
whatever it might be there appeared to be now some hope of finding it
the desert began to lighten
gray openings in the border of shrubby growths changed to paler hue
the road could be seen some rods ahead and it had become a stony descent down steadily down
dark ridged backs of mountains bounded the horizon and all seemed near at hand hemming in the plain
in the east a white glow grew brighter and brighter reaching up to a line of cloud defined sharply below by a rugged notched range
presently a silver circle rose behind the black mountain and the gloom of the desert underwent a transformation
from a gray mantle it changed to a transparent haze
the moon was rising
senor i am cold said mercedes
dick had been carrying his coat upon his arm
he had felt warm even hot and had imagined that the steady walk had occasioned it
but his skin was cool
the heat came from an inward burning
he stopped the horse and raised the coat up and helped mercedes put it on
i should have thought of you he said
but i seemed to feel warm
the coat's a little large we might wrap it round you twice
mercedes smiled and lightly thanked him in spanish
the flash of mood was in direct contrast to the appealing passionate and tragic states in which he had successively viewed her and it gave him a vivid impression of what vivacity and charm she might possess under happy conditions
he was about to start when he observed that ladd had halted and was peering ahead in evident caution
mercedes' horse began to stamp impatiently raised his ears and head and acted as if he was about to neigh
a warning hist
from ladd bade dick to put a quieting hand on the horse
lash came noiselessly forward to join his companion
the two then listened and watched
an uneasy yet thrilling stir ran through gale's veins
this scene was not fancy
these men of the ranges had heard or seen or scented danger
it was all real as tangible and sure as the touch of mercedes's hand upon his arm
probably for her the night had terrors beyond gale's power to comprehend
he looked down into the desert and would have felt no surprise at anything hidden away among the bristling cactus the dark winding arroyos the shadowed rocks with their moonlit tips the ragged plain leading to the black bold mountains
the wind appeared to blow softly with an almost imperceptible moan over the desert
that was a new sound to gale
but he heard nothing more
presently lash went to the rear and ladd started ahead
the progress now however was considerably slower not owing to a roadfor that became betterbut probably owing to caution exercised by the cowboy guide
at the end of a half hour this marked deliberation changed and the horses followed ladd's at a gait that put gale to his best walkingpaces
meanwhile the moon soared high above the black corrugated peaks
the gray the gloom the shadow whitened
the clearing of the dark foreground appeared to lift a distant veil and show endless aisles of desert reaching down between dim horizonbounding ranges
gale gazed abroad knowing that as this night was the first time for him to awake to consciousness of a vague wonderful other self so it was one wherein he began to be aware of an encroaching presence of physical thingsthe immensity of the starstudded sky the soaring moon the bleak mysterious mountains and limitless slope and plain and ridge and valley
these things in all their magnificence had not been unnoticed by him before only now they spoke a different meaning
a voice that he had never heard called him to see to feel the vast hard externals of heaven and earth all that represented the open the free silence and solitude and space
once more his thoughts like his steps were halted by ladd's actions
the cowboy reined in his horse listened a moment then swung down out of the saddle
he raised a cautioning hand to the others then slipped into the gloom and disappeared
gale marked that the halt had been made in a ridged and cutup pass between low mesas
he could see the columns of cactus standing out black against the moonwhite sky
the horses were evidently tiring for they showed no impatience
gale heard their panting breaths and also the bark of some animala dog or a coyote
it sounded like a dog and this led gale to wonder if there was any house near at hand
to the right up under the ledges some distance away stood two square black objects too uniform he thought to be rocks
while he was peering at them uncertain what to think the shrill whistle of a horse pealed out to be followed by the rattling of hoofs on hard stone
then a dog barked
at the same moment that ladd hurriedly appeared in the road a light shone out and danced before one of the square black objects
keep close an' don't make no noise he whispered and led his horse at right angles off the road
gale followed leading mercedes's horse
as he turned he observed that lash also had dismounted
to keep closely at ladd's heels without brushing the cactus or stumbling over rocks and depressions was a task gale found impossible
after he had been stabbed several times by the bayonetlike spikes which seemed invisible the matter of caution became equally one of selfpreservation
both the cowboys dick had observed wore leather chaps
it was no easy matter to lead a spirited horse through the dark winding lanes walled by thorns
mercedes horse often balked and had to be coaxed and carefully guided
dick concluded that ladd was making a wide detour
the position of certain stars grown familiar during the march veered round from one side to another
dick saw that the travel was fast but by no means noiseless
the pack animals at times crashed and ripped through the narrow places
it seemed to gale that any one within a mile could have heard these sounds
from the tops of knolls or ridges he looked back trying to locate the mesas where the light had danced and the dog had barked alarm
he could not distinguish these two rocky eminences from among many rising in the background
presently ladd let out into a wider lane that appeared to run straight
the cowboy mounted his horse and this fact convinced gale that they had circled back to the road
the march proceeded then once more at a good steady silent walk
when dick consulted his watch he was amazed to see that the hour was still early
how much had happened in little time
he now began to be aware that the night was growing colder and strange to him he felt something damp that in a country he knew he would have recognized as dew
he had not been aware there was dew on the desert
the wind blew stronger the stars shone whiter the sky grew darker and the moon climbed toward the zenith
the road stretched level for miles then crossed arroyos and ridges wound between mounds of broken ruined rock found a level again and then began a long ascent
dick asked mercedes if she was cold and she answered that she was speaking especially of her feet which were growing numb
then she asked to be helped down to walk awhile
at first she was cold and lame and accepted the helping hand dick proffered
after a little however she recovered and went on without assistance
dick could scarcely believe his eyes as from time to time he stole a sidelong glance at this silent girl who walked with lithe and rapid stride
she was wrapped in his long coat yet it did not hide her slender grace
he could not see her face which was concealed by the black mantle
a lowspoken word from ladd recalled gale to the question of surroundings and of possible dangers
ladd had halted a few yards ahead
they had reached the summit of what was evidently a high ridge which sloped with much greater steepness on the far side
it was only after a few more forward steps however that dick could see down the slope
then full in view flashed a bright campfire around which clustered a group of dark figures
they were encamped in a wide arroyo where horses could be seen grazing in black patches of grass between clusters of trees
a second look at the campers told gale they were mexicans
at this moment lash came forward to join ladd and the two spent a long uninterrupted moment studying the arroyo
a hoarse laugh faint yet distinct floated up on the cool wind
well laddy what're you makin' of that outfit
inquired lash speaking softly
same as any of them raider outfits replied ladd
they're across the line for beef
but they'll run off any good stock
as hoss thieves these rebels have got 'em all beat
that outfit is waitin' till it's late
there's a ranch up the arroyo
gale heard the first speaker curse under his breath
sure i feel the same said ladd
but we've got a girl an' the young man to look after not to mention our pack outfit
an' we're huntin' for a job not a fight old hoss
keep on your chaps
nothin' to it but head south for the rio forlorn
you're talkin' sense now jim
i wish we'd headed that way long ago
but it ain't strange i'd want to travel away from the border thinkin' of the girl
jim we can't go round this greaser outfit an' strike the road again
too rough
so we'll have to give up gettin' to san felipe
perhaps it's just as well laddy
rio forlorn is on the border line but it's country where these rebels ain't been yet
wait till they learn of the oasis an' beldin's hosses
exclaimed laddy
i'm not anticipatin' peace anywhere along the border jim
but we can't go ahead we can't go back
what'll we do laddy
it's a hike to beldin's ranch
an' if we get there in daylight some greaser will see the girl before beldin' can hide her
it'll get talked about
the news'll travel to casita like sage balls before the wind
shore we won't ride into rio forlorn in the daytime
let's slip the packs jim
we can hid them off in the cactus an' come back after them
with the young man ridin' we  the whispering was interrupted by a loud ringing neigh that whistled up from the arroyo
one of the horses had scented the travelers on the ridge top
the indifference of the mexicans changed to attention
ladd and lash turned back and led the horses into the first opening on the south side of the road
there was nothing more said at the moment and manifestly the cowboys were in a hurry
gale had to run in the open places to keep up
when they did stop it was welcome to gale for he had begun to fall behind
the packs were slipped securely tied and hidden in a mesquite clump
ladd strapped a blanket around one of the horses
his next move was to take off his chaps
gale you're wearin' boots an' by liftin' your feet you can beat the cactus he whispered
but thethemiss castaneda she'll be torn all to pieces unless she puts these on
please tell heran' hurry
dick took the chaps and going up to mercedes he explained the situation
she laughed evidently at his embarrassed earnestness and slipped out of the saddle
senor chapparejos and i are not strangers she said
deftly and promptly she equipped herself and then gale helped her into the saddle called to her horse and started off
lash directed gale to mount the other saddled horse and go next
dick had not ridden a hundred yards behind the trotting leaders before he had sundry painful encounters with reaching cactus arms
the horse missed these by a narrow margin
dick's knees appeared to be in line and it became necessary for him to lift them high and let his boots take the onslaught of the spikes
he was at home in the saddle and the accomplishment was about the only one he possessed that had been of any advantage during his sojourn in the west
ladd pursued a zigzag course southward across the desert trotting down the aisles cantering in wide bare patches walking through the clumps of cacti
the desert seemed all of a sameness to dicka wilderness of rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges always looking close yet never growing any nearer
the moon slanted back toward the west losing its white radiance and the gloom of the earlier evening began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas
by and by ladd entered an arroyo and here the travelers turned and twisted with the meanderings of a dry stream bed
at the head of a canyon they had to take once more to the rougher ground
always it led down always it grew rougher more rolling with wider bare spaces always the black ranges loomed close
gale became chilled to the bone and his clothes were damp and cold
his knees smarted from the wounds of the poisoned thorns and his right hand was either swollen stiff or too numb to move
moreover he was tiring
the excitement the long walk the miles on miles of jolting trotthese had wearied him
mercedes must be made of steel he thought to stand all that she had been subjected to and yet when the stars were paling and dawn perhaps not far away stay in the saddle
so dick gale rode on drowsier for each mile and more and more giving the horse a choice of ground
sometimes a prod from a murderous spine roused dick
a grayness had blotted out the waning moon in the west and the clear dark starry sky overhead
once when gale thinking to fight his weariness raised his head he saw that one of the horses in the lead was riderless
ladd was carrying mercedes
dick marveled that her collapse had not come sooner
another time rousing himself again he imagined they were now on a good hard road
it seemed that hours passed though he knew only little time had elapsed when once more he threw off the spell of weariness
he heard a dog bark
tall trees lined the open lane down which he was riding
presently in the gray gloom he saw low square houses with flat roofs
ladd turned off to the left down another lane gloomy between trees
every few rods there was one of the squat houses
this lane opened into wider lighter space
the cold air bore a sweet perfumewhether of flowers or fruit dick could not tell
ladd rode on for perhaps a quarter of a mile though it seemed interminably long to dick
a grove of trees loomed dark in the gray morning
ladd entered it and was lost in the shade
dick rode on among trees
presently he heard voices and soon another house low and flat like the others but so long he could not see the farther end stood up blacker than the trees
as he dismounted cramped and sore he could scarcely stand
lash came alongside
he spoke and some one with a big hearty voice replied to him
then it seemed to dick that he was led into blackness like pitch where presently he felt blankets thrown on him and then his drowsy faculties faded
iv  forlorn river  when dick opened his eyes a flood of golden sunshine streamed in at the open window under which he lay
his first thought was one of blank wonder as to where in the world he happened to be
the room was large square adobewalled
it was littered with saddles harness blankets
upon the floor was a bed spread out upon a tarpaulin
probably this was where some one had slept
the sight of huge dusty spurs a gun belt with sheath and gun and a pair of leather chaps bristling with broken cactus thorns recalled to dick the cowboys the ride mercedes and the whole strange adventure that had brought him there
he did not recollect having removed his boots indeed upon second thought he knew he had not done so
but there they stood upon the floor
ladd and lash must have taken them off when he was so exhausted and sleepy that he could not tell what was happening
he felt a dead weight of complete lassitude and he did not want to move
a sudden pain in his hand caused him to hold it up
it was black and blue swollen to almost twice its normal size and stiff as a board
the knuckles were skinned and crusted with dry blood
dick soliloquized that it was the worstlooking hand he had seen since football days and that it would inconvenience him for some time
a warm dry fragrant breeze came through the window
dick caught again the sweet smell of flowers or fruit
he heard the fluttering of leaves the murmur of running water the twittering of birds then the sound of approaching footsteps and voices
the door at the far end of the room was open
through it he saw poles of peeled wood upholding a porch roof a bench rose bushes in bloom grass and beyond these brightgreen foliage of trees
he shore was sleepin' when i looked in an hour ago said a voice that dick recognized as ladd's
let him sleep came the reply in deep goodnatured tones
mrs b says the girl's never moved
must have been a tough ride for them both
forty miles through cactus
young gale hoofed darn near half the way replied ladd
we tried to make him ride one of our hosses
if we had we'd never got here
a walk like that'd killed me an' jim
well laddy i'm right down glad to see you boys and i'll do all i can for the young couple said the other
but i'm doing some worry here don't mistake me
about your stock
i've got only a few head of cattle at the oasis now i'm worrying some mostly about my horses
the u s is doing some worrying too don't mistake me
the rebels have worked west and north as far as casita
there are no cavalrymen along the line beyond casita and there can't be
it's practically waterless desert
but these rebels are desert men
they could cross the line beyond the rio forlorn and smuggle arms into mexico
of course my job is to keep tab on chinese and japs trying to get into the us from magdalena bay
but i'm supposed to patrol the border line
i'm going to hire some rangers
now i'm not so afraid of being shot up though out in this lonely place there's danger of it what i'm afraid of most is losing that bunch of horses
if any rebels come this far or if they ever hear of my horses they're going to raid me
you know what those guerrilla mexicans will do for horses
they're crazy on horse flesh
they know fine horses
they breed the finest in the world
so i don't sleep nights any more
reckon me an' jim might as well tie up with your for a spell beldin'
we've been ridin' up an' down arizona tryin' to keep out of sight of wire fences
laddy it's open enough around forlorn river to satisfy even an oldtime cowpuncher like you laughed belding
i'd take your staying on as some favor don't mistake me
perhaps i can persuade the young man gale to take a job with me
that's shore likely
he said he had no money no friends
an' if a scrapper's all you're lookin' for he'll do replied ladd with a dry chuckle
mrs b will throw some broncho capers round this ranch when she hears i'm going to hire a stranger
why
well there's nell and you said this gale was a young american
my wife will be scared to death for fear nell will fall in love with him
laddy choked off a laugh then evidently slapped his knee or belding's for there was a resounding smack
he's a finespoken goodlooking chap you said
went on belding
shore he is said laddy warmly
what do you say jim
by this time dick gale's ears began to burn and he was trying to make himself deaf when he wanted to hear every little word
husky young fellow nice voice steady clear eyes kinda proud i thought an' some handsome he was replied jim lash
maybe i ought to think twice before taking a stranger into my family said belding seriously
well i guess he's all right laddy being the cavalryman's friend
no bum or lunger
he must be all right
bum
lunger
say didn't i tell you i shook hands with this boy an' was plumb glad to meet him
demanded laddy with considerable heat
manifestly he had been affronted
tom beldin' he's a gentleman an' he could lick you inin half a second
how about that jim
less time replied lash
tom here's my stand
young gale can have my hoss my gun anythin' of mine
aw i didn't mean to insult you boys don't mistake me said belding
course he's all right
the object of this conversation lay quiet upon his bed thrilling and amazed at being so championed by the cowboys delighted with belding's idea of employing him and much amused with the quaint seriousness of the three
how's the young man
called a woman's voice
it was kind and mellow and earnest
gale heard footsteps on flagstones
he's asleep yet wife replied belding
guess he was pretty much knocked out
i'll close the door there so we won't wake him
there were slow soft steps then the door softly closed
but the fact scarcely made a perceptible difference in the sound of the voices outside
laddy and jim are going to stay went on belding
it'll be like the old panhandle days a little
i'm powerful glad to have the boys nellie
you know i meant to sent to casita to ask them
we'll see some trouble before the revolution is ended
i think i'll make this young man gale an offer
he isn't a cowboy
asked mrs belding quickly
no
shore he'd make a darn good one put in laddy
what is he
who is he
where did he come from
surely you must be  laddy swears he's all right interrupted the husband
that's enough reference for me
isn't it enough for you
humph
laddy knows a lot about young men now doesn't he especially strangers from the east
tom you must be careful
wife i'm only too glad to have a nervy young chap come along
what sense is there in your objection if jim and laddy stick up for him
but tomhe'll fall in love with nell
protested mrs belding
well wouldn't that be regular
doesn't every man who comes along fall in love with nell
hasn't it always happened
when she was a schoolgirl in kansas didn't it happen
didn't she have a hundred mooneyed ninnies after her in texas
i've had some peace out here in the desert except when a greaser or a prospector or a yaqui would come along
then same old storyin love with nell
but tom nell might fall in love with this young man
exclaimed the wife in distress
laddy jim didn't i tell you
cried belding
i knew she'd say that my dear wife i would be simply overcome with joy if nell did fall in love once
real good and hard
she's wilder than any antelope out there on the desert
nell's nearly twenty now and so far as we know she's never cared a rap for any fellow
and she's just as gay and full of the devil as she was at fourteen
nell's as good and lovable as she is pretty but i'm afraid she'll never grow into a woman while we live out in this lonely land
and you've always hated towns where there was a chance for the girljust because you were afraid she'd fall in love
you've always been strange even silly about that
i've done my best for nellloved her as if she were my own daughter
i've changed many business plans to suit your whims
there are rough times ahead maybe
i need men
i'll hire this chap gale if he'll stay
let nell take her chance with him just as she'll have to take chances with men when we get out of the desert
she'll be all the better for it
i hope laddy's not mistaken in his opinion of this newcomer replied mrs belding with a sigh of resignation
shore i never made a mistake in my life figger'n' people said laddy stoutly
yes you have laddy replied mrs belding
you're wrong about tom well supper is to be got
that young man and the girl will be starved
i'll go in now
if nell happens around don'tdon't flatter her laddy like you did at dinner
don't make her think of her looks
dick heard mrs belding walk away
shore she's powerful particular about that girl observed laddy
say tom nell knows she's pretty doesn't she
she's liable to find it out unless you shut up laddy
when you visited us out here some weeks ago you kept paying cowboy compliments to her
an' it's your idea that cowboy compliments are plumb bad for girls
downright bad laddy so my wife says
i'll be darned if i believe any girl can be hurt by a little sweet talk
it pleases 'em
but say beldin' speaking of looks have you got a peek yet at the spanish girl
not in the light
well neither have i in daytime
i had enough by moonlight
nell is some on looks but i'm regretful passin' the ribbon to the lady from mex
jim where are you
my money's on nell replied lash
gimme a girl with flesh an' color an' blue eyes alaughin'
miss castaneda is some peach i'll not gainsay
but her face seemed too white
an' when she flashed those eyes on me i thought i was shot
when she stood up there at first thankin' us i felt as if aa princess was round somewhere
now nell is kiddish an' sweet an'  chop it interrupted belding
here comes nell now
dick's tingling ears took in the pattering of light footsteps the rush of some one running
here you are cried a sweet happy voice
dad the senorita is perfectly lovely
i've been peeping at her
she sleeps likelike death
she's so white
oh i hope she won't be ill  shore she's only played out said laddy
but she had spunk while it lasted
i was just arguin' with jim an' tom about miss castaneda
gracious
why she's beautiful
i never saw any one so beautiful how strange and sad that about her
tell me more laddy
you promised
i'm dying to know
i never hear anything in this awful place
didn't you say the senorita had a sweetheart
shore i did
and he's a cavalryman
yes
is he the young man who came with you
nope
that fellow's the one who saved the girl from rojas
ah
where is he laddy
he's in there asleep
is he hurt
i reckon not
he walked about fifteen miles
is henice laddy
shore
what is he like
well i'm not long acquainted never saw him by day but i was some tolerable took with him
an' jim here jim says the young man can have his gun an' his hoss
wonderful
laddy what on earth did this stranger do to win you cowboys in just one night
i'll shore have to tell you
me an' jim were watchin' a game of cards in the del sol saloon in casita
that's across the line
we had acquaintancesfour fellows from the cross bar outfit where we worked a while back
this del sol is a billiard hall saloon restaurant an' the like
an' it was full of greasers
some of camp's rebels were there drinkin' an' playin' games
then pretty soon in come rojas with some of his outfit
they were packin' guns an' kept to themselves off to one side
i didn't give them a second look till jim said he reckoned there was somethin' in the wind
then carelesslike i began to peek at rojas
they call rojas the 'dandy rebel' an' he shore looked the part
it made me sick to see him in all that lace an' glitter knowin' him to be the cutthroat robber he is
it's no oncommon sight to see excited greasers
they're all crazy
but this bandit was shore some agitated
he kept his men in a tight bunch round a table
he talked an' waved his hands
he was actually shakin'
his eyes had a wild glare
now i figgered that trouble was brewin' most likely for the little casita garrison
people seemed to think campo an' rojas would join forces to oust the federals
jim thought rojas's excitement was at the hatchin' of some plot
anyway we didn't join no card games an' without pretendin' to we was some watchful
a little while afterward i seen a fellow standin' in the restaurant door
he was a young american dressed in corduroys and boots like a prospector
you know it's no onusual fact to see prospectors in these parts
what made me think twice about this one was how big he seemed how he filled up that door
he looked round the saloon an' when he spotted rojas he sorta jerked up
then he pulled his slouch hat lopsided an' began to stagger down down the steps
first off i made shore he was drunk
but i remembered he didn't seem drunk before
it was some queer
so i watched that young man
he reeled around the room like a fellow who was drunker'n a lord
nobody but me seemed to notice him
then he began to stumble over poolplayers an' get his feet tangled up in chairs an' bump against tables
he got some pretty hard looks
he came round our way an' all of a sudden he seen us cowboys
he gave another start like the one when he first seen rojas then he made for us
i tipped jim off that somethin' was doin'
when he got close he straightened up put back his slouch hat an' looked at us
then i saw his face
it sorta electrified yours truly
it was white with veins standin' out an' eyes flamin'a face of fury
i was plumb amazed didn't know what to think
then this queer young man shot some cool polite words at me an' jim
he was only bluffin' at bein' drunkhe meant to rush rojas to start a rough house
the bandit was after a girl
this girl was in the hotel an' she was the sweetheart of a soldier the young fellow's friend
the hotel was watched by rojas's guards an' the plan was to make a fuss an' get the girl away in the excitement
well jim an' me got a hint of our bein' americansthat cowboys generally had a name for loyalty to women
then this amazin' chapyou can't imagine how scornfulsaid for me an' jim to watch him
before i could catch my breath an' figger out what he meant by 'rush' an' 'rough house' he had knocked over a table an' crowded some greaser half off the map
one little funny man leaped up like a wild monkey an' began to screech
an' in another second he was in the air upside down
when he lit he laid there
then quicker'n i can tell you the young man dove at rojas
like a mad steer on the rampage he charged rojas an' his men
the whole outfit went downsmash
i figgered then what 'rush' meant
the young fellow came up out of the pile with rojas an' just like i'd sling an empty sack along the floor he sent the bandit
but swift as that went he was on top of rojas before the chairs an' tables had stopped rollin'
i woke up then an' made for the center of the room
jim with me
i began to shoot out the lamps
jim throwed his guns on the crazy rebels an' i was afraid there'd be blood spilled before i could get the room dark
bein's shore busy i lost sight of the young fellow for a second or so an' when i got an eye free for him i seen a greaser about to knife him
think i was some considerate of the greaser by only shootin' his arm off
then i cracked the last lamp an' in the hullabaloo me an' jim vamoosed
we made tracks for our hosses an' packs an' was hittin' the san felipe road when we run right plumb into the young man
well he said his name was galedick gale
the girl was with him safe an' well but her sweetheart the soldier bein' away without leave had to go back sudden
there shore was some trouble for jim an' me heard shootin'
gale said he had no money no friends was a stranger in a desert country an' he was distracted to know how to help the girl
so me an' jim started off with them for san felipe got switched and' then we headed for the rio forlorn
oh i think he was perfectly splendid
exclaimed the girl
shore he was
only nell you can't lay no claim to bein' the original discoverer of that fact
but laddy you haven't told me what he looks like
at this juncture dick gale felt it absolutely impossible for him to play the eavesdropper any longer
quietly he rolled out of bed
the voices still sounded close outside and it was only by effort that he kept from further listening
belding's kindly interest laddy's blunt and sincere cowboy eulogy the girl's sweet eagerness and praisethese warmed gale's heart
he had fallen among simple people into whose lives the advent of an unknown man was welcome
he found himself in a singularly agitated mood
the excitement the thrill the difference felt in himself experienced the preceding night had extended on into his present
and the possibilities suggested by the conversation he had unwittingly overheard added sufficiently to the other feelings to put him into a peculiarly receptive state of mind
he was wild to be one of the belding rangers
the idea of riding a horse in the open desert with a dangerous duty to perform seemed to strike him with an appealing force
something within him went out to the cowboys to this blunt and kind belding
he was afraid to meet the girl
if every man who came along fell in love with this sweetvoiced nell then what hope had he to escapenow when his whole inner awakening betokened a change of spirit hope a finding of real worth real good real power in himself
he did not understand wholly yet he felt ready to ride to fight to love the desert to love these outdoor men to love a woman
that beautiful spanish girl had spoken to something dead in him and it had quickened to life
the sweet voice of an audacious unseen girl warned him that presently a still more wonderful thing would happen to him
gale imagined he made noise enough as he clumsily pulled on his boots yet the voices split by a merry laugh kept on murmuring outside the door
it was awkward for him having only one hand available to lace up his boots
he looked out of the window
evidently this was at the end of the house
there was a flagstone walk beside which ran a ditch full of swift muddy water
it made a pleasant sound
there were trees strange of form and color to to him
he heard bees birds chickens saw the red of roses and green of grass
then he saw close to the wall a tub full of water and a bench upon which lay basin soap towel comb and brush
the window was also a door for under it there was a step
gale hesitated a moment then went out
he stepped naturally hoping and expecting that the cowboys would hear him
but nobody came
awkwardly with left hand he washed his face
upon a nail in the wall hung a little mirror by the aid of which dick combed and brushed his hair
he imagined he looked a most haggard wretch
with that he faced forward meaning to go round the corner of the house to greet the cowboys and these newfound friends
dick had taken but one step when he was halted by laugher and the patter of light feet
from close around the corner pealed out that sweet voice
dad you'll have your wish and mama will be wild
dick saw a little foot sweep into view a white dress then the swiftly moving form of a girl
she was looking backward
dad i shall fall in love with your new ranger
i willi have  then she plumped squarely into dick's arms
she started back violently
dick saw a fair face and darkblue audaciously flashing eyes
swift as lightning their expression changed to surprise fear wonder
for an instant they were level with dick's grave questioning
suddenly sweetly she blushed
ohh
she faltered
then the blush turned to a scarlet fire
she whirled past him and like a white gleam was gone
dick became conscious of the quickened beating of his heart
he experienced a singular exhilaration
that moment had been the one for which he had been ripe the event upon which strange circumstances had been rushing him
with a couple of strides he turned the corner
laddy and lash were there talking to a man of burly form
seen by day both cowboys were grayhaired redskinned and weatherbeaten with lean sharp features and gray eyes so much alike that they might have been brothers
hello there's the young fellow spoke up the burly man
mr gale i'm glad to meet you
my name's belding
his greeting was as warm as his handclasp was long and hard
gale saw a heavy man of medium height
his head was large and covered with grizzled locks
he wore a shortcropped mustache and chin beard
his skin was brown and his dark eyes beamed with a genial light
the cowboys were as cordial as if dick had been their friend for years
young man did you run into anything as you came out
asked belding with twinkling eyes
why yes i met something white and swift flying by replied dick
did she see you
asked laddy
i think so but she didn't wait for me to introduce myself
that was nell burton my girlstepdaughter i should say said belding
she's sure some whirlwind as laddy calls her
come let's go in and meet the wife
the house was long like a barracks with porch extending all the way and doors every dozen paces
when dick was ushered into a sittingroom he was amazed at the light and comfort
this room had two big windows and a door opening into a patio where there were luxuriant grass roses in bloom and flowering trees
he heard a slow splashing of water
in mrs belding gale found a woman of noble proportions and striking appearance
her hair was white
she had a strong serious welllined face that bore haunting evidences of past beauty
the gaze she bent upon him was almost piercing in its intensity
her greeting which seemed to dick rather slow in coming was kind though not cordial
gale's first thought after he had thanked these good people for their hospitality was to inquire about mercedes
he was informed that the spanish girl had awakened with a considerable fever and nervousness
when however her anxiety had been allayed and her thirst relieved she had fallen asleep again
mrs belding said the girl had suffered no great hardship other than mental and would very soon be rested and well
now gale said belding when his wife had excused herself to get supper the boys jim and laddy told me about you and the mixup at casita
i'll be glad to take care of the girl till it's safe for your soldier friend to get her out of the country
that won't be very soon don't mistake me
i don't want to seem overcurious about youladdy has interested me in youand straight out i'd like to know what you propose to do now
i haven't any plans replied dick and taking the moment as propitious he decided to speak frankly concerning himself
i just drifted down here
my home is in chicago
when i left school some years agoi'm twentyfive nowi went to work for my father
he'she has business interests there
i tried all kinds of inside jobs
i couldn't please my father
i guess i put no real heart in my work
the fact was i didn't know how to work
the governor and i didn't exactly quarrel but he hurt my feelings and i quit
six months or more ago i came west and have knocked about from wyoming southwest to the border
i tried to find congenial work but nothing came my way
to tell you frankly mr belding i suppose i didn't much care
i believe though that all the time i didn't know what i wanted
i've learnedwell just lately  what do you want to do
interposed belding
i want a man's job
i want to do things with my hands
i want action
i want to be outdoors
belding nodded his head as if he understood that and he began to speak again cut something short then went on hesitatingly  galeyou could go home againto the old manit'd be all right
mr belding there's nothing shady in my past
the governor would be glad to have me home
that's the only consolation i've got
but i'm not going
i'm broke
i won't be a tramp
and it's up to me to do something
how'd you like to be a border ranger
asked belding laying a hand on dick's knee
part of my job here is united states inspector of immigration
i've got that boundary line to patrolto keep out chinks and japs
this revolution has added complications and i'm looking for smugglers and raiders here any day
you'll not be hired by the u s you'll simply be my ranger same as laddy and jim who have promised to work for me
i'll pay you well give you a room here furnish everything down to guns and the finest horse you ever saw in your life
your job won't be safe and healthy sometimes but it'll be a man's jobdon't mistake me
you can gamble on having things to do outdoors
now what do you say
i accept and i thank youi can't say how much replied gale earnestly
good
that's settled
let's go out and tell laddy and jim
both boys expressed satisfaction at the turn of affairs and then with belding they set out to take gale around the ranch
the house and several outbuildings were constructed of adobe which according to belding retained the summer heat on into winter and the winter cold on into summer
these grayred mud habitations were hideous to look at and this fact perhaps made their really comfortable interiors more vividly a contrast
the wide grounds were covered with luxuriant grass and flowers and different kinds of trees
gale's interest led him to ask about fig trees and pomegranates and especially about a beautiful specimen that belding called palo verde
belding explained that the luxuriance of this desert place was owing to a few springs and the dammedup waters of the rio forlorn
before he had come to the oasis it had been inhabited by a papago indian tribe and a few peon families
the oasis lay in an arroyo a mile wide and sloped southwest for some ten miles or more
the river went dry most of the year but enough water was stored in flood season to irrigate the gardens and alfalfa fields
i've got one neverfailing spring on my place said belding
fine sweet water
you know what that means in the desert
i like this oasis
the longer i live here the better i like it
there's not a spot in southern arizona that'll compare with this valley for water or grass or wood
it's beautiful and healthy
forlorn and lonely yes especially for women like my wife and nell but i like it and between you and me boys i've got something up my sleeve
there's gold dust in the arroyos and there's mineral up in the mountains
if we only had water
this hamlet has steadily grown since i took up a station here
why casita is no place beside forlorn river
pretty soon the southern pacific will shoot a railroad branch out here
there are possibilities and i want you boys to stay with me and get in on the ground floor
i wish this rebel war was over well here are the corrals and the fields
gale take a look at that bunch of horses
belding's last remark was made as he led his companions out of shady gardens into the open
gale saw an adobe shed and a huge pen fenced by strangely twisted and contorted branches or trunks of mesquite and beyond these wide flat fields greena dark rich greenand dotted with beautiful horses
there were whites and blacks and bays and grays
in his admiration gale searched his memory to see if he could remember the like of these magnificent animals and had to admit that the only ones he could compare with them were the arabian steeds
every ranch loves his horses said belding
when i was in the panhandle i had some fine stock
but these are mexican
they came from durango where they were bred
mexican horses are the finest in the world bar none
shore i reckon i savvy why you don't sleep nights drawled laddy
i see a greaser out thereno it's an indian
that's my papago herdsman
i keep watch over the horses now day and night
lord how i'd hate to have rojas or salazarany of those bandit rebelsfind my horses
gale can you ride
dick modestly replied that he could according to the eastern idea of horsemanship
you don't need to be half horse to ride one of that bunch
but over there in the other field i've ironjawed broncos i wouldn't want you to tackleexcept to see the fun
i've an outlaw i'll gamble even laddy can't ride
so
how much'll you gamble
asked laddy instantly
the ringing of a bell which belding said was a call to supper turned the men back toward the house
facing that way gale saw dark beetling ridges rising from the oasis and leading up to bare black mountains
he had heard belding call them no name mountains and somehow the appellation suited those lofty mysterious frowning peaks
it was not until they reached the house and were about to go in that belding chanced to discover gale's crippled hand
what an awful hand
he exclaimed
where the devil did you get that
i stove in my knuckles on rojas replied dick
you did that in one punch
say i'm glad it wasn't me you hit
why didn't you tell me
that's a bad hand
those cuts are full of dirt and sand
inflammation's setting in
it's got to be dressed
nell
he called
there was no answer
he called again louder
mother where's the girl
she's there in the diningroom replied mrs belding
did she hear me
he inquired impatiently
of course
nell
roared belding
this brought results
dick saw a glimpse of golden hair and a white dress in the door
but they were not visible longer than a second
dad what's the matter
asked a voice that was still as sweet as formerly but now rather small and constrained
bring the antiseptics cotton bandagesand things out here
hurry now
belding fetched a pail of water and a basin from the kitchen
his wife followed him out and upon seeing dick's hand was all solicitude
then dick heard light quick footsteps but he did not look up
nell this is mr galedick gale who came with the boys last last night said belding
he's got an awful hand
got it punching that greaser rojas
i want you to dress it gale this is my stepdaughter nell burton of whom i spoke
she's some good when there's somebody sick or hurt
shove out your fist my boy and let her get at it
supper's nearly ready
dick felt that same strange quickening heart throb yet he had never been cooler in his life
more than anything else in the world he wanted to look at nell burton however divining that the situation might be embarrassing to her he refrained from looking up
she began to bathe his injured knuckles
he noted the softness the deftness of her touch and then it seemed her fingers were not quite as steady as they might have been
still in a moment they appeared to become surer in their work
she had beautiful hands not too large though certainly not small and they were strong brown supple
he observed next with stealthy upwardstealing glance that she had rolled up her sleeves exposing fine round arms graceful in line
her skin was brownno it was more gold than brown
it had a wonderful clear tint
dick stoically lowered his eyes then putting off as long as possible the alluring moment when he was to look into her face
that would be a fateful moment
he played with a certain strange joy of anticipation
when however she sat down beside him and rested his injured hand in her lap as she cut bandages she was so thrillingly near that he yielded to an irrepressible desire to look up
she had a sweet fair face warmly tinted with that same healthy goldenbrown sunburn
her hair was light gold and abundant a waving mass
her eyes were shaded by long downcast lashes yet through them he caught a gleam of blue
despite the stir within him gale seeing she was now absorbed in her task critically studied her with a second closer gaze
she was a sweet wholesome joyous pretty girl
shore it musta hurt
replied laddy who sat an interested spectator
yes i confess it did replied dick slowly with his eyes on nell's face
but i didn't mind
the girl's lashes swept up swiftly in surprise
she had taken his words literally
but the darkblue eyes met his for only a fleeting second
then the warm tint in her cheeks turned as red as her lips
hurriedly she finished tying the bandage and rose to her feet
i thank you said gale also rising
with that belding appeared in the doorway and finding the operation concluded called them in to supper
dick had the use of only one arm and he certainly was keenly aware of the shy silent girl across the table but in spite of these considerable handicaps he eclipsed both hungry cowboys in the assault upon mrs belding's bounteous supper
belding talked the cowboys talked more or less
mrs belding put in a word now and then and dick managed to find brief intervals when it was possible for him to say yes or no
he observed gratefully that no one round the table seemed to be aware of his enormous appetite
after supper having a favorable opportunity when for a moment no one was at hand dick went out through the yard past the gardens and fields and climbed the first knoll
from that vantage point he looked out over the little hamlet somewhat to his right and was surprised at its extent its considerable number of adobe houses
the overhanging mountains ragged and darkening a great heave of splintered rock rather chilled and affronted him
westward the setting sun gilded a spiked frostcolored limitless expanse of desert
it awed gale
everywhere rose blunt broken ranges or isolated groups of mountains
yet the desert stretched away down between and beyond them
when the sun set and gale could not see so far he felt a relief
that grand and austere attraction of distance gone he saw the desert nearer at handthe valley at his feet
what a strange gray somber place
there was a lighter strip of gray winding down between darker hues
this he realized presently was the river bed and he saw how the pools of water narrowed and diminished in size till they lost themselves in gray sand
this was the rainy season near its end and here a little river struggled hopelessly forlornly to live in the desert
he received a potent impression of the nature of that blasted ageworn waste which he had divined was to give him strength and work and love
v  a desert rose  belding assigned dick to a little room which had no windows but two doors one opening into the patio the other into the yard on the west side of the house
it contained only the barest necessities for comfort
dick mentioned the baggage he had left in the hotel at casita and it was belding's opinion that to try to recover his property would be rather risky on the moment richard gale was probably not popular with the mexicans at casita
so dick bade goodby to fine suits of clothes and linen with a feeling that as he had said farewell to an idle and useless past it was just as well not to have any old luxuries as reminders
as he possessed however not a thing save the clothes on his back and not even a handkerchief he expressed regret that he had come to forlorn river a beggar
beggar hell
exploded belding with his eyes snapping in the lamplight
money's the last thing we think of out here
all the same gale if you stick you'll be rich
it wouldn't surprise me replied dick thoughtfully
but he was not thinking of material wealth
then as he viewed his stained and torn shirt he laughed and said belding while i'm getting rich i'd like to have some respectable clothes
we've a little mex store in town and what you can't get there the women folks will make for you
when dick lay down he was dully conscious of pain and headache that he did not feel well
despite this and a mind thronging with memories and anticipations he succumbed to weariness and soon fell asleep
it was light when he awoke but a strange brightness seen through what seemed blurred eyes
a moment passed before his mind worked clearly and then he had to make an effort to think
he was dizzy
when he essayed to lift his right arm an excruciating pain made him desist
then he discovered that his arm was badly swollen and the hand had burst its bandages
the injured member was red angry inflamed and twice its normal size
he felt hot all over and a raging headache consumed him
belding came stamping into the room
hello dick
do you know it's late
how's the busted fist this morning
dick tried to sit up but his effort was a failure
he got about half up then felt himself weakly sliding back
i guessi'm pretty sick he said
he saw belding lean over him feel his face and speak and then everything seemed to drift not into darkness but into some region where he had dim perceptions of gray moving things and of voices that were remote
then there came an interval when all was blank
he knew not whether it was one of minutes or hours but after it he had a clearer mind
he slept awakened during nighttime and slept again
when he again unclosed his eyes the room was sunny and cool with a fragrant breeze that blew through the open door
dick felt better but he had no particular desire to move or talk or eat
he had however a burning thirst
mrs belding visited him often her husband came in several times and once nell slipped in noiselessly
even this last event aroused no interest in dick
on the next day he was very much improved
we've been afraid of blood poisoning said belding
but my wife thinks the danger's past
you'll have to rest that arm for a while
ladd and jim came peeping in at the door
come in boys
he can have companythe more the betterif it'll keep him content
he mustn't move that's all
the cowboys entered slow easy cool kindvoiced
shore it's tough said ladd after he had greeted dick
you look used up
jim lash wagged his halfbald sunburned head musta been more'n tough for rojas
gale laddy tells me one of our neighbors fellow named carter is going to casita put in belding
here's a chance to get word to your friend the soldier
oh that will be fine
exclaimed dick
i declare i'd forgotten thorne how is miss castaneda
i hope  she's all right gale
been up and around the patio for two days
like all the spanishthe real thingshe's made of damascus steel
we've been getting acquainted
she and nell made friends at once
i'll call them in
he closed the door leading out into the yard explaining that he did not want to take chances of mercedes's presence becoming known to neighbors
then he went to the patio and called
both girls came in mercedes leading
like nell she wore white and she had a red rose in her hand
dick would scarcely have recognized anything about her except her eyes and the way she carried her little head and her beauty burst upon him strange and anew
she was swift impulsive in her movements to reach his side
senor i am so sorry you were illso happy you are better
dick greeted her offering his left hand gravely apologizing for the fact that owing to a late infirmity he could not offer the right
her smile exquisitely combined sympathy gratitude admiration
then dick spoke to nell likewise offering his hand which she took shyly
her reply was a murmured unintelligible one but her eyes were glad and the tint in her cheeks threatened to rival the hue of the rose she carried
everybody chatted then except nell who had apparently lost her voice
presently dick remembered to speak of the matter of getting news to thorne
senor may i write to him
will some one take a letter
i shall hear from him
she said and her white hands emphasized her words
assuredly
i guess poor thorne is almost crazy
i'll write to him no i can't with this crippled hand
that'll be all right gale said belding
nell will write for you
she writes all my letters
so belding arranged it and mercedes flew away to her room to write while nell fetched pen and paper and seated herself beside gale's bed to take his dictation
what with watching nell and trying to catch her glance and listening to belding's talk with the cowboys dick was hard put to it to dictate any kind of a creditable letter
nell met his gaze once then no more
the color came and went in her cheeks and sometimes when he told her to write so and so there was a demure smile on her lips
she was laughing at him
and belding was talking over the risks involved in a trip to casita
shore i'll ride in with the letters ladd said
no you won't replied belding
that bandit outfit will be laying for you
well i reckon if they was i wouldn't be oncommon grieved
i'll tell you boys i'll ride in myself with carter
there's business i can see to and i'm curious to know what the rebels are doing
laddy keep one eye open while i'm gone
see the horses are locked up gale i'm going to casita myself
ought to get back tomorrow some time
i'll be ready to start in an hour
have your letter ready
and sayif you want to write home it's a chance
sometimes we don't go to the p o in a month
he tramped out followed by the tall cowboys and then dick was enabled to bring his letter to a close
mercedes came back and her eyes were shining
dick imagined a letter received from her would be something of an event for a fellow
then remembering belding's suggestion he decided to profit by it
may i trouble you to write another for me
asked dick as he received the letter from nell
it's no trouble i'm surei'd be pleased she replied
that was altogether a wonderful speech of hers dick thought because the words were the first coherent ones she had spoken to him
may i stay
asked mercedes smiling
by all means he answered and then he settled back and began
presently gale paused partly because of genuine emotion and stole a look from under his hand at nell
she wrote swiftly and her downcast face seemed to be softer in its expression of sweetness
if she had in the very least been drawn to him  but that was absurdimpossible
when dick finished dictating his eyes were upon mercedes who sat smiling curious and sympathetic
how responsive she was
he heard the hasty scratch of nell's pen
he looked at nell
presently she rose holding out his letter
he was just in time to see a wave of red recede from her face
she gave him one swift gaze unconscious searching then averted it and turned away
she left the room with mercedes before he could express his thanks
but that strange speaking flash of eyes remained to haunt and torment gale
it was indescribably sweet and provocative of thoughts that he believed were wild without warrant
something within him danced for very joy and the next instant he was conscious of wistful doubt a gravity that he could not understand
it dawned upon him that for the brief instant when nell had met his gaze she had lost her shyness
it was a woman's questioning eyes that had pierced through him
during the rest of the day gale was content to lie still on his bed thinking and dreaming dozing at intervals and watching the lights change upon the mountain peaks feeling the warm fragrant desert wind that blew in upon him
he seemed to have lost the faculty of estimating time
a long while strong in its effect upon him appeared to have passed since he had met thorne
he accepted things as he felt them and repudiated his intelligence
his old inquisitive habit of mind returned
did he love nell
was he only attracted for the moment
what was the use of worrying about her or himself
he refused to answer and deliberately gave himself up to dreams of her sweet face and of that last darkblue glance
next day he believed he was well enough to leave his room but mrs belding would not permit him to do so
she was kind softhanded motherly and she was always coming in to minister to his comfort
this attention was sincere not in the least forced yet gale felt that the friendliness so manifest in the others of the household did not extend to her
he was conscious of something that a little thought persuaded him was antagonism
it surprised and hurt him
he had never been much of a success with girls and young married women but their mothers and old people had generally been fond of him
still though mrs belding's hair was snowwhite she did not impress him as being old
he reflected that there might come a time when it would be desirable far beyond any ground of everyday friendly kindliness to have mrs belding be well disposed toward him
so he thought about her and pondered how to make her like him
it did not take very long for dick to discover that he liked her
her face except when she smiled was thoughtful and sad
it was a face to make one serious
like a haunting shadow like a phantom of happier years the sweetness of nell's face was there and infinitely more of beauty than had been transmitted to the daughter
dick believed mrs belding's friendship and motherly love were worth striving to win entirely aside from any more selfish motive
he decided both would be hard to get
often he felt her deep penetrating gaze upon him and though this in no wise embarrassed himfor he had no shameful secrets of past or presentit showed him how useless it would be to try to conceal anything from her
naturally on first impulse he wanted to hide his interest in the daughter but he resolved to be absolutely frank and true and through that win or lose
moreover if mrs belding asked him any questions about his home his family his connections he would not avoid direct and truthful answers
toward evening gale heard the tramp of horses and belding's hearty voice
presently the rancher strode in upon gale shaking the gray dust from his broad shoulders and waving a letter
hello dick
good news and bad
he said putting the letter in dick's hand
had no trouble finding your friend thorne
looked like he'd been drunk for a week
say he nearly threw a fit
i never saw a fellow so wild with joy
he made sure you and mercedes were lost in the desert
he wrote two letters which i brought
don't mistake me boy it was some fun with mercedes just now
i teased her wouldn't give her the letter
you ought to have seen her eyes
if ever you see a blackandwhite desert hawk swoop down upon a quail then you'll know how mercedes pounced upon her letter well casita is one hell of a place these days
i tried to get your baggage and i think i made a mistake
we're going to see travel toward forlorn river
the federal garrison got reinforcements from somewhere and is holding out
there's been fighting for three days
the rebels have a string of flat railroad cars all iron and they ran this up within range of the barricades
they've got some machine guns and they're going to lick the federals sure
there are dead soldiers in the ditches mexican noncombatants lying dead in the streetsand buzzards everywhere
it's reported that campo the rebel leader is on the way up from sinaloa and huerta a federal general is coming to relieve the garrison
i don't take much stock in reports
but there's hell in casita all right
do you think we'll have trouble out here
asked dick excitedly
sure
some kind of trouble sooner or later replied belding gloomily
why you can stand on my ranch and step over into mexico
laddy says we'll lose horses and other stock in night raids
jim lash doesn't look for any worse
but jim isn't as well acquainted with greasers as i am
anyway my boy as soon as you can hold a bridle and a gun you'll be on the job don't mistake me
with laddy and jim
asked dick trying to be cool
sure
with them and me and by yourself
dick drew a deep breath and even after belding had departed he forgot for a moment about the letter in his hand
then he unfolded the paper and read   dear dickyou've more than saved my life
to the end of my days you'll be the one man to whom i owe everything
words fail to express my feelings
this must be a brief note
belding is waiting and i used up most of the time writing to mercedes
i like belding
he was not unknown to me though i never met or saw him before
you'll be interested to learn that he's the unadulterated article the real western goods
i've heard of some of his stunts and they made my hair curl
dick your luck is staggering
the way belding spoke of you was great
but you deserve it old man
i'm leaving mercedes in your charge subject of course to advice from belding
take care of her dick for my life is wrapped up in her
by all means keep her from being seen by mexicans
we are sitting tight herenothing doing
if some action doesn't come soon it'll be darned strange
things are centering this way
there's scrapping right along and people have begun to move
we're still patrolling the line eastward of casita
it'll be impossible to keep any tab on the line west of casita for it's too rough
that cactus desert is awful
cowboys or rangers with desertbred horses might keep raiders and smugglers from crossing
but if cavalrymen could stand that waterless wilderness which i doubt much their horses would drop under them
if things do quiet down before my commission expires i'll get leave of absence run out to forlorn river marry my beautiful spanish princess and take her to a civilized country where i opine every son of a gun who sees her will lose his head and drive me mad
it's my great luck old pal that you are a fellow who never seemed to care about pretty girls
so you won't give me the double cross and run off with mercedescarry her off like the villain in the play i mean
that reminds me of rojas
oh dick it was glorious
you didn't do anything to the dandy rebel
not at all
you merely caressed himgently moved him to one side
dick harken to these glad words rojas is in the hospital
i was interested to inquire
he had a smashed finger a dislocated collar bone three broken ribs and a fearful gash on his face
he'll be in the hospital for a month
dick when i meet that pigheaded dad of yours i'm going to give him the surprise of his life
send me a line whenever any one comes in from f r and inclose mercedes's letter in yours
take care of her dick and may the future hold in store for you some of the sweetness i know now
faithfully yours thorne
dick reread the letter then folded it and placed it under his pillow
never cared for pretty girls huh
he soliloquized
george i never saw any till i struck southern arizona
guess i'd better make up for lost time
while he was eating his supper with appetite rapidly returning to normal ladd and jim came in bowing their tall heads to enter the door
their friendly advances were singularly welcome to gale but he was still backward
he allowed himself to show that he was glad to see them and he listened
jim lash had heard from belding the result of the mauling given to rojas by dick
and jim talked about what a grand thing that was
ladd had a good deal to say about belding's horses
it took no keen judge of human nature to see that horses constituted ladd's ruling passion
i've had wimmen go back on me but never no hoss
declared ladd and manifestly that was a controlling truth with him
shore it's a cinch beldin' is agoin' to lose some of them hosses he said
you can search me if i don't think there'll be more doin' on the border here than along the rio grande
we're just the same as on greaser soil
mebbe we don't stand no such chance of bein' shot up as we would across the line
but who's goin' to give up his hosses without a fight
half the time when beldin's stock is out of the alfalfa it's grazin' over the line
he thinks he's careful about them hosses but he ain't
look ahere laddy you cain't believe all you hear replied jim seriously
i reckon we mightn't have any trouble
back up jim
shore you're standin' on your bridle
i ain't goin' much on reports
remember that american we met in casita the prospector who'd just gotten out of sonora
he had some story he had
swore he'd killed seventeen greasers breakin' through the rebel line round the mine where he an' other americans were corralled
the next day when i met him again he was drunk an' then he told me he'd shot thirty greasers
the chances are he did kill some
but reports are exaggerated
there are miners fightin' for life down in sonora you can gamble on that
an' the truth is bad enough
take rojas's harryin' of the senorita for instance
can you beat that
shore jim there's more doin' than the raidin' of a few hosses
an' forlorn river is goin' to get hers
another dawn found gale so much recovered that he arose and looked after himself not however without considerable difficulty and rather disheartening twinges of pain
some time during the morning he heard the girls in the patio and called to ask if he might join them
he received one response a mellow si senor
it was not as much as he wanted but considering that it was enough he went out
he had not as yet visited the patio and surprise and delight were in store for him
he found himself lost in a labyrinth of green and rosebordered walks
he strolled around discovering that the patio was a courtyard open at an end but he failed to discover the young ladies
so he called again
the answer came from the center of the square
after stooping to get under shrubs and wading through bushes he entered an open sandy circle full of magnificent and murderous cactus plants strange to him
on the other side in the shade of a beautiful tree he found the girls
mercedes sitting in a hammock nell upon a blanket
what a beautiful tree
he exclaimed
i never saw one like that
what is it
palo verde replied nell
senor palo verde means 'green tree' added mercedes
this desert tree which had struck dick as so new and strange and beautiful was not striking on account of size for it was small scarcely reaching higher than the roof but rather because of its exquisite color of green trunk and branch alike and owing to the odd fact that it seemed not to possess leaves
all the tree from ground to tiny flat twigs was a soft polished green
it bore no thorns
right then and there began dick's education in desert growths and he felt that even if he had not had such charming teachers he would still have been absorbed
for the patio was full of desert wonders
a twistingtrunked tree with full foliage of small gray leaves nell called a mesquite
then dick remembered the name and now he saw where the desert got its palegray color
a huge lofty fluted column of green was a saguaro or giant cactus
another oddshaped cactus resembling the legs of an inverted devilfish bore the name ocatillo
each branch rose high and symmetrical furnished with sharp blades that seemed to be at once leaves and thorns
yet another cactus interested gale and it looked like a huge low barrel covered with greenribbed cloth and long thorns
this was the bisnaga or barrel cactus
according to nell and mercedes this plant was a happy exception to its desert neighbors for it secreted water which had many times saved the lives of men
last of the cacti to attract gale and the one to make him shiver was a low plant consisting of stem and many rounded protuberances of a frosty steely white and covered with long murderous spikes
from this plant the desert got its frosty glitter
it was as stiff as unyielding as steel and bore the name choya
dick's enthusiasm was contagious and his earnest desire to learn was flattering to his teachers
when it came to assimilating spanish however he did not appear to be so apt a pupil
he managed after many trials to acquire buenos dias and buenos tardes and senorita and gracias and a few other short terms
dick was indeed eager to get a little smattering of spanish and perhaps he was not really quite so stupid as he pretended to be
it was delightful to be taught by a beautiful spaniard who was so gracious and intense and magnetic of personality and by a sweet american girl who moment by moment forgot her shyness
gale wished to prolong the lessons
so that was the beginning of many afternoons in which he learned desert lore and spanish verbs and something else that he dared not name
nell burton had never shown to gale that daring side of her character which had been so suggestively defined in belding's terse description and ladd's encomiums and in her own audacious speech and merry laugh and flashing eye of that nevertobeforgotten first meeting
she might have been an entirely different girl
but gale remembered and when the ice had been somewhat broken between them he was always trying to surprise her into her real self
there were moments that fairly made him tingle with expectation
yet he saw little more than a ghost of her vivacity and never a gleam of that individuality which belding had called a devil
on the few occasions that dick had been left alone with her in the patio nell had grown suddenly unresponsive and restrained or she had left him on some transparent pretext
on the last occasion mercedes returned to find dick staring disconsolately at the rosebordered path where nell had evidently vanished
the spanish girl was wonderful in her divination
senor dick
she cried
dick looked at her soberly nodded his head and then he laughed
mercedes had seen through him in one swift glance
her white hand touched his in wordless sympathy and thrilled him
this spanish girl was all fire and passion and love
she understood him she was his friend she pledged him what he felt would be the most subtle and powerful influence
little by little he learned details of nell's varied life
she had lived in many places
as a child she remembered moving from town to town of going to school among schoolmates whom she never had time to know
lawrence kansas where she studied for several years was the later exception to this changeful nature of her schooling
then she moved to stillwater oklahoma from there to austin texas and on to waco where her mother met and married belding
they lived in new mexico awhile in tucson arizona in douglas and finally had come to lonely forlorn river
mother could never live in one place any length of time said nell
and since we've been in the southwest she has never ceased trying to find some trace of her father
he was last heard of in nogales fourteen years ago
she thinks grandfather was lost in the sonora desert and every place we go is worse
oh i love the desert
but i'd like to go back to lawrenceor to see chicago or new yorksome of the places mr gale speaks of
i remember the college at lawrence though i was only twelve
i saw racesand once real football
since then i've read magazines and papers about big football games and i was always fascinated  mr gale of course you've seen games
yes a few replied dick and he laughed a little
it was on his lips then to tell her about some of the famous games in which he had participated
but he refrained from exploiting himself
there was little however of the color and sound and cheer of the violent action and rush and battle incidental to a big college football game that he did not succeed in making mercedes and nell feel just as if they had been there
they hung breathless and wideeyed upon his words
some one else was present at the latter part of dick's narrative
the moment he became aware of mrs belding's presence he remembered fancying he had heard her call and now he was certain she had done so
mercedes and nell however had been and still were oblivious to everything except dick's recital
he saw mrs belding cast a strange intent glance upon nell then turn and go silently through the patio
dick concluded his talk but the brilliant beginning was not sustained
dick was haunted by the strange expression he had caught on mrs belding's face especially the look in her eyes
it had been one of repressed pain liberated in a flash of certainty
the mother had seen just as quickly as mercedes how far he had gone on the road of love
perhaps she had seen moreeven more than he dared hope
the incident roused gale
he could not understand mrs belding nor why that look of hers that seeming baffled hopeless look of a woman who saw the inevitable forces of life and could not thwart them should cause him perplexity and distress
he wanted to go to her and tell her how he felt about nell but fear of absolute destruction of his hopes held him back
he would wait
nevertheless an instinct that was perhaps akin to selfpreservation prompted him to want to let nell know the state of his mind
words crowded his brain seeking utterance
who and what he was how he loved her the work he expected to take up soon his longings hopes and plansthere was all this and more
but something checked him
and the repression made him so thoughtful and quiet even melancholy that he went outdoors to try to throw off the mood
the sun was yet high and a dazzling white light enveloped valleys and peaks
he felt that the wonderful sunshine was the dominant feature of that arid region
it was like white gold
it had burned its color in a face he knew
it was going to warm his blood and brown his skin
a hot languid breeze so dry that he felt his lips shrink with its contact came from the desert and it seemed to smell of wideopen untainted places where sand blew and strange pungent plants gave a bittersweet tang to the air
when he returned to the house some hours later his room had been put in order
in the middle of the white coverlet on his table lay a fresh red rose
nell had dropped it there
dick picked it up feeling a throb in his breast
it was a bud just beginning to open to show between its petals a darkred unfolding heart
how fragrant it was how exquisitely delicate how beautiful its inner hue of red deep and dark the crimson of life blood
had nell left it there by accident or by intent
was it merely kindness or a girl's subtlety
was it a message couched elusively a symbol a hope in a halfblown desert rose
vi  the yaqui  toward evening of a lowering december day some fifty miles west of forlorn river a horseman rode along an old dimly defined trail
from time to time he halted to study the lay of the land ahead
it was bare somber ridgy desert covered with duncolored greasewood and stunted prickly pear
distant mountains hemmed in the valley raising black spurs above the round lomas and the squarewalled mesas
this lonely horseman bestrode a steed of magnificent build perfectly white except for a dark bar of color running down the noble head from ears to nose
sweatcaked dust stained the long flanks
the horse had been running
his mane and tail were laced and knotted to keep their length out of reach of grasping cactus and brush
clumsy homemade leather shields covered the front of his forelegs and ran up well to his wide breast
what otherwise would have been muscular symmetry of limb was marred by many a scar and many a lump
he was lean gaunt worn a huge machine of muscle and bone beautiful only in head and mane a weightcarrier a horse strong and fierce like the desert that had bred him
the rider fitted the horse as he fitted the saddle
he was a young man of exceedingly powerful physique wideshouldered longarmed biglegged
his lean face where it was not red blistered and peeling was the hue of bronze
he had a dark eye a falcon gaze roving and keen
his jaw was prominent and set mastifflike his lips were stern
it was youth with its softness not yet quite burned and hardened away that kept the whole cast of his face from being ruthless
this young man was dick gale but not the listless traveler nor the lounging wanderer who two months before had by chance dropped into casita
friendship chivalry lovethe deepseated unplumbed emotions that had been stirred into being with all their incalculable power for spiritual change had rendered different the meaning of life
in the moment almost of their realization the desert had claimed gale and had drawn him into its crucible
the desert had multiplied weeks into years
heat thirst hunger loneliness toil fear ferocity painhe knew them all
he had felt them allthe white sun with its glazed coalescing lurid fire the caked split lips and rasping drypuffed tongue the sickening ache in the pit of his stomach the insupportable silence the empty space the utter desolation the contempt of life the weary ride the long climb the plod in sand the search search search for water the sleepless night alone the watch and wait the dread of ambush the swift flight the fierce pursuit of men wild as bedouins and as fleet the willingness to deal sudden death the pain of poison thorn the stinging tear of lead through flesh and that strange paradox of the burning desert the cold at night the piercing icy wind the dew that penetrated to the marrow the numbing desert cold of the dawn
beyond any dream of adventure he had ever had beyond any wild story he had ever read had been his experience with those hardriding rangers ladd and lash
then he had traveled alone the hundred miles of desert between forlorn river and the sonoyta oasis
ladd's prophecy of trouble on the border had been mild compared to what had become the actuality
with rebel occupancy of the garrison at casita outlaws bandits raiders in rioting bands had spread westward
like troops of arabs magnificently mounted they were here there everywhere along the line and if murder and worse were confined to the mexican side pillage and raiding were perpetrated across the border
many a darkskinned raider bestrode one of belding's fast horses and indeed all except his selected white thoroughbreds had been stolen
so the job of the rangers had become more than a patrolling of the boundary line to keep japanese and chinese from being smuggled into the united states
belding kept close at home to protect his family and to hold his property
but the three rangers in fulfilling their duty had incurred risks on their own side of the line had been outraged robbed pursued and injured on the other
some of the few waterholes that had to be reached lay far across the border in mexican territory
horses had to drink men had to drink and ladd and lash were not of the stripe that forsook a task because of danger
slow to wrath at first as became men who had long lived peaceful lives they had at length revolted and desert vultures could have told a gruesome story
made a comrade and ally of these bordermen dick gale had leaped at the desert action and strife with an intensity of heart and a rare physical ability which accounted for the remarkable fact that he had not yet fallen by the way
on this december afternoon the three rangers as often were separated
lash was far to the westward of sonoyta somewhere along camino del diablo that terrible devil's road where many desert wayfarers had perished
ladd had long been overdue in a prearranged meeting with gale
the fact that ladd had not shown up miles west of the papago well was significant
the sun had hidden behind clouds all the latter part of that day an unusual occurrence for that region even in winter
and now as the light waned suddenly telling of the hidden sunset a cold dry penetrating wind sprang up and blew in gale's face
not at first but by imperceptible degrees it chilled him
he untied his coat from the back of the saddle and put it on
a few cold drops of rain touched his cheek
he halted upon the edge of a low escarpment
below him the narrowing valley showed bare black ribs of rock long winding gray lines leading down to a central floor where mesquite and cactus dotted the barren landscape
moving objects diminutive in size gray and white in color arrested gale's roving sight
they bobbed away for a while then stopped
they were antelope and they had seen his horse
when he rode on they started once more keeping to the lowest level
these wary animals were often desert watchdogs for the ranger they would betray the proximity of horse or man
with them trotting forward he made better time for some miles across the valley
when he lost them caution once more slowed his advance
the valley sloped up and narrowed to head into an arroyo where grass began to show gray between the clumps of mesquite
shadows formed ahead in the hollows along the walls of the arroyo under the trees and they seemed to creep to rise to float into a veil cast by the background of bold mountains at last to claim the skyline
night was not close at hand but it was there in the east lifting upward drooping downward encroaching upon the west
gale dismounted to lead his horse to go forward more slowly
he had ridden sixty miles since morning and he was tired and a not entirely healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little
a mile up the arroyo near its head lay the papago well
the need of water for his horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided
the well was on mexican soil
gale distinguished a faint light flickering through the thin sharp foliage
campers were at the well and whoever they were no doubt they had prevented ladd from meeting gale
ladd had gone back to the next waterhole or maybe he was hiding in an arroyo to the eastward awaiting developments
gale turned his horse not without urge of iron arm and persuasive speech for the desert steed scented water and plodded back to the edge of the arroyo where in a secluded circle of mesquite he halted
the horse snorted his relief at the removal of the heavy burdened saddle and accoutrements and sagging bent his knees lowered himself with slow heave and plunged down to roll in the sand
gale poured the contents of his larger canteen into his hat and held it to the horse's nose
drink sol he said
it was but a drop for a thirsty horse
however blanco sol rubbed a wet muzzle against gale's hand in appreciation
gale loved the horse and was loved in return
they had saved each other's lives and had spent long days and nights of desert solitude together
sol had known other masters though none so kind as this new one but it was certain that gale had never before known a horse
the spot of secluded ground was covered with bunches of galleta grass upon which sol began to graze
gale made a long halter of his lariat to keep the horse from wandering in search of water
next gale kicked off the cumbersome chapparejos with their flapping tripping folds of leather over his feet and drawing a long rifle from its leather sheath he slipped away into the shadows
the coyotes were howling not here and there but in concerted volume at the head of the arroyo
to dick this was no more reassuring than had been the flickering light of the campfire
the wild desert dogs with their characteristic insolent curiosity were baying men round a campfire
gale proceeded slowly halting every few steps careful not to brush against the stiff greasewood
in the soft sand his steps made no sound
the twinkling light vanished occasionally like a jacko'lantern and when it did show it seemed still a long way off
gale was not seeking trouble or inviting danger
water was the thing that drove him
he must see who these campers were and then decide how to give blanco sol a drink
a rabbit rustled out of brush at gale's feet and thumped away over the sand
the wind pattered among dry broken stalks of dead ocatilla
every little sound brought gale to a listening pause
the gloom was thickening fast into darkness
it would be a night without starlight
he moved forward up the pale zigzag aisles between the mesquite
he lost the light for a while but the coyotes' chorus told him he was approaching the campfire
presently the light danced through the black branches and soon grew into a flame
stooping low with bushy mesquites between him and the fire gale advanced
the coyotes were in full cry
gale heard the tramping stamping thumps of many hoofs
the sound worried him
foot by foot he advanced and finally began to crawl
the wind favored his position so that neither coyotes nor horses could scent him
the nearer he approached the head of the arroyo where the well was located the thicker grew the desert vegetation
at length a dead palo verde with huge black clumps of its parasite mistletoe thick in the branches marked a distance from the well that gale considered close enough
noiselessly he crawled here and there until he secured a favorable position and then rose to peep from behind his covert
he saw a bright fire not a cookingfire for that would have been low and red but a crackling blaze of mesquite
three men were in sight all close to the burning sticks
they were mexicans and of the coarse type of raiders rebels bandits that gale expected to see
one stood up his back to the fire another sat with shoulders enveloped in a blanket and the third lounged in the sand his feet almost in the blaze
they had cast off belts and weapons
a glint of steel caught gale's eye
three short shiny carbines leaned against a rock
a little to the left within the circle of light stood a square house made of adobe bricks
several untrimmed poles upheld a roof of brush which was partly fallen in
this house was a papago indian habitation and a month before had been occupied by a family that had been murdered or driven off by a roving band of outlaws
a rude corral showed dimly in the edge of firelight and from a black mass within came the snort and stamp and whinney of horses
gale took in the scene in one quick glance then sank down at the foot of the mesquite
he had naturally expected to see more men
but the situation was by no means new
this was one or part of one of the raider bands harrying the border
they were stealing horses or driving a herd already stolen
these bands were more numerous than the waterholes of northern sonora they never camped long at one place like arabs they roamed over the desert all the way from nogales to casita
if gale had gone peaceably up to this campfire there were a hundred chances that the raiders would kill and rob him to one chance that they might not
if they recognized him as a ranger comrade of ladd and lash if they got a glimpse of blanco sol then gale would have no chance
these mexicans had evidently been at the well some time
their horses being in the corral meant that grazing had been done by day
gale revolved questions in mind
had this trio of outlaws run across ladd
it was not likely for in that event they might not have been so comfortable and carefree in camp
were they waiting for more members of their gang
that was very probable
with gale however the most important consideration was how to get his horse to water
sol must have a drink if it cost a fight
there was stern reason for gale to hurry eastward along the trail
he thought it best to go back to where he had left his horse and not make any decisive move until daylight
with the same noiseless care he had exercised in the advance gale retreated until it was safe for him to rise and walk on down the arroyo
he found blanco sol contentedly grazing
a heavy dew was falling and as the grass was abundant the horse did not show the usual restlessness and distress after a dry and exhausting day
gale carried his saddle blankets and bags into the lee of a little greasewoodcovered mound from around which the wind had cut the soil and here in a wash he risked building a small fire
by this time the wind was piercingly cold
gale's hands were numb and he moved them to and fro in the little blaze
then he made coffee in a cup cooked some slices of bacon on the end of a stick and took a couple of hard biscuits from a saddlebag
of these his meal consisted
after that he removed the halter from blanco sol intending to leave him free to graze for a while
then gale returned to his little fire replenished it with short sticks of dead greasewood and mesquite and wrapping his blanket round his shoulders he sat down to warm himself and to wait till it was time to bring in the horse and tie him up
the fire was inadequate and gale was cold and wet with dew
hunger and thirst were with him
his bones ached and there was a dull deepseated pain throbbing in his unhealed wound
for days unshaven his beard seemed like a million pricking needles in his blistered skin
he was so tired that once having settled himself he did not move hand or foot
the night was dark dismal cloudy windy growing colder
a moan of wind in the mesquite was occasionally pierced by the highkeyed yelp of a coyote
there were lulls in which the silence seemed to be a thing of stifling encroaching substancea thing that enveloped buried the desert
judged by the great average of ideals and conventional standards of life dick gale was a starved lonely suffering miserable wretch
but in his case the judgment would have hit only externals would have missed the vital inner truth
for gale was happy with a kind of strange wild glory in the privations the pains the perils and the silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land
in the past he had not been of any use to himself or others and he had never know what it meant to be hungry cold tired lonely
he had never worked for anything
the needs of the day had been provided and tomorrow and the future looked the same
danger peril toilthese had been words read in books and papers
in the present he used his hands his senses and his wits
he had a duty to a man who relied on his services
he was a comrade a friend a valuable ally to riding fighting rangers
he had spent endless days weeks that seemed years alone with a horse trailing over climbing over hunting over a desert that was harsh and hostile by nature and perilous by the invasion of savage men
that horse had become human to gale
and with him gale had learned to know the simple needs of existence
like dead scales the superficialities the falsities the habits that had once meant all of life dropped off useless things in this stern waste of rock and sand
gale's happiness as far as it concerned the toil and strife was perhaps a grim and stoical one
but love abided with him and it had engendered and fostered other undeveloped traitsromance and a feeling for beauty and a keen observation of nature
he felt pain but he was never miserable
he felt the solitude but he was never lonely
as he rode across the desert even though keen eyes searched for the moving black dots the rising puffs of white dust that were warnings he saw nell's face in every cloud
the cleancut mesas took on the shape of her straight profile with its strong chin and lips its fine nose and forehead
there was always a glint of gold or touch of red or graceful line or gleam of blue to remind him of her
then at night her face shone warm and glowing flushing and paling in the campfire
tonight as usual with a keen ear to the wind gale listened as one on guard yet he watched the changing phantom of a sweet face in the embers and as he watched he thought
the desert developed and multiplied thought
a thousand sweet faces glowed in the pink and white ashes of his campfire the faces of other sweethearts or wives that had gleamed for other men
gale was happy in his thought of nell for nell for something when he was alone this way in the wilderness told him she was near him she thought of him she loved him
but there were many men alone on that vast southwestern plateau and when they saw dream faces surely for some it was a fleeting flash a gleam soon gone like the hope and the name and the happiness that had been and was now no more
often gale thought of those hundreds of desert travelers prospectors wanderers who had ventured down the camino del diablo never to be heard of again
belding had told him of that most terrible of all desert trailsa trail of shifting sands
lash had traversed it and brought back stories of buried waterholes of bones bleaching white in the sun of gold mines as lost as were the prospectors who had sought them of the merciless yaqui and his hatred for the mexican
gale thought of this trail and the men who had camped along it
for many there had been one night one campfire that had been the last
this idea seemed to creep in out of the darkness the loneliness the silence and to find a place in gale's mind so that it had strange fascination for him
he knew now as he had never dreamed before how men drifted into the desert leaving behind graves wrecked homes ruined lives lost wives and sweethearts
and for every wanderer every campfire had a phantom face
gale measured the agony of these men at their last campfire by the joy and promise he traced in the ruddy heart of his own
by and by gale remembered what he was waiting for and getting up he took the halter and went out to find blanco sol
it was pitchdark now and gale could not see a rod ahead
he felt his way and presently as he rounded a mesquite he saw sol's white shape outlined against the blackness
the horse jumped and wheeled ready to run
it was doubtful if any one unknown to sol could ever have caught him
gale's low call reassured him and he went on grazing
gale haltered him in the likeliest patch of grass and returned to his camp
there he lifted his saddle into a protected spot under a low wall of the mound and laying one blanket on the sand he covered himself with the other and stretched himself for the night
here he was out of reach of the wind but he heard its melancholy moan in the mesquite
there was no other sound
the coyotes had ceased their hungry cries
gale dropped to sleep and slept soundly during the first half of the night and after that he seemed always to be partially awake aware of increasing cold and damp
the dark mantle turned gray and then daylight came quickly
the morning was clear and nipping cold
he threw off the wet blanket and got up cramped and half frozen
a little brisk action was all that was necessary to warm his blood and loosen his muscles and then he was fresh tingling eager
the sun rose in a golden blaze and the descending valley took on wondrous changing hues
then he fetched up blanco sol saddled him and tied him to the thickest clump of mesquite
sol we'll have a drink pretty soon he said patting the splendid neck
gale meant it
he would not eat till he had watered his horse
sol had gone nearly fortyeight hours without a sufficient drink and that was long enough even for a desertbred beast
no three raiders could keep gale away from that well
taking his rifle in hand he faced up the arroyo
rabbits were frisking in the short willows and some were so tame he could have kicked them
gale walked swiftly for a goodly part of the distance and then when he saw blue smoke curling up above the trees he proceeded slowly with alert eye and ear
from the lay of the land and position of trees seen by daylight he found an easier and safer course that the one he had taken in the dark
and by careful work he was enabled to get closer to the well and somewhat above it
the mexicans were leisurely cooking their morning meal
they had two fires one for warmth the other to cook over
gale had an idea these raiders were familiar to him
it seemed all these border hawks resembled one anotherbeing mostly small of build wiry angular swarthyfaced and blackhaired and they wore the oddly styled mexican clothes and sombreros
a slow wrath stirred in gale as he watched the trio
they showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp
one fellow evidently the leader packed a gun at his hip the only weapon in sight
gale noted this with speculative eyes
the raiders had slept inside the little adobe house and had not yet brought out the carbines
next gale swept his gaze to the corral in which he saw more than a dozen horses some of them fine animals
they were stamping and whistling fighting one another and pawing the dirt
this was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass
but suddenly one of the blacks a big shaggy fellow shot up his ears and pointed his nose over the top of the fence
he whistled
other horses looked in the same direction and their ears went up and they too whistled
gale knew that other horses or men very likely both were approaching
but the mexicans did not hear the alarm or show any interest if they did
these mescaldrinking raiders were not scouts
it was notorious how easily they could be surprised or ambushed
mostly they were ignorant thickskulled peons
they were wonderful horsemen and could go long without food or water but they had not other accomplishments or attributes calculated to help them in desert warfare
they had poor sight poor hearing poor judgment and when excited they resembled crazed ants running wild
gale saw two indians on burros come riding up the other side of the knoll upon which the adobe house stood and apparently they were not aware of the presence of the mexicans for they came on up the path
one indian was a papago
the other striking in appearance for other reasons than that he seemed to be about to fall from the burro gale took to be a yaqui
these travelers had absolutely nothing for an outfit except a blanket and a halfempty bag
they came over the knoll and down the path toward the well turned a corner of the house and completely surprised the raiders
gale heard a short shrill cry strangely high and wild and this came from one of the indians
it was answered by hoarse shouts
then the leader of the trio the mexican who packed a gun pulled it and fired pointblank
he missed onceand again
at the third shot the papago shrieked and tumbled off his burro to fall in a heap
the other indian swayed as if the taking away of the support lent by his comrade had brought collapse and with the fourth shot he too slipped to the ground
the reports had frightened the horses in the corral and the vicious black crowding the rickety bars broke them down
he came plunging out
two of the mexicans ran for him catching him by nose and mane and the third ran to block the gateway
then with a splendid vaulting mount the mexican with the gun leaped to the back of the horse
he yelled and waved his gun and urged the black forward
the manner of all three was savagely jocose
they were having sport
the two on the ground began to dance and jabber
the mounted leader shot again and then stuck like a leech upon the bare back of the rearing black
it was a vain show of horsemanship
then this mexican by some strange grip brought the horse down plunging almost upon the body of the indian that had fallen last
gale stood aghast with his rifle clutched tight
he could not divine the intention of the raider but suspected something brutal
the horse answered to that cruel guiding hand yet he swerved and bucked
he reared aloft pawing the air wildly snorting then he plunged down upon the prostrate indian
even in the act the intelligent animal tried to keep from striking the body with his hoofs
but that was not possible
a yell hideous in its passion signaled this feat of horsemanship
the mexican made no move to trample the body of the papago
he turned the black to ride again over the other indian
that brought into gale's mind what he had heard of a mexican's hate for a yaqui
it recalled the barbarism of these savage peons and the war of extermination being waged upon the yaquis
suddenly gale was horrified to see the yaqui writhe and raise a feeble hand
the action brought renewed and more savage cries from the mexicans
the horse snorted in terror
gale could bear no more
he took a quick shot at the rider
he missed the moving figure but hit the horse
there was a bound a horrid scream a mighty plunge then the horse went down giving the mexican a stunning fall
both beast and man lay still
gale rushed from his cover to intercept the other raiders before they could reach the house and their weapons
one fellow yelled and ran wildly in the opposite direction the other stood stricken in his tracks
gale ran in close and picked up the gun that had dropped from the raider leader's hand
this fellow had begun to stir to come out of his stunned condition
then the frightened horses burst the corral bars and in a thundering dustmantled stream fled up the arroyo
the fallen raider sat up mumbling to his saints in one breath cursing in his next
the other mexican kept his stand intimidated by the threatening rifle
go greasers
run
yelled gale
then he yelled it in spanish
at the point of his rifle he drove the two raiders out of the camp
his next move was to run into the house and fetch out the carbines
with a heavy stone he dismantled each weapon
that done he set out on a run for his horse
he took the shortest cut down the arroyo with no concern as to whether or not he would encounter the raiders
probably such a meeting would be all the worse for them and they knew it
blanco sol heard him coming and whistled a welcome and when gale ran up the horse was snorting war
mounting gale rode rapidly back to the scene of the action and his first thought when he arrived at the well was to give sol a drink and to fill his canteens
then gale led his horse up out of the waterhole and decided before remounting to have a look at the indians
the papago had been shot through the heart but the yaqui was still alive
moreover he was conscious and staring up at gale with great strange somber eyes black as volcanic slag
gringo goodno kill he said in husky whisper
his speech was not affirmative so much as questioning
yaqui you're done for said gale and his words were positive
he was simply speaking aloud his mind
yaquino hurtmuch replied the indian and then he spoke a strange wordrepeated it again and again
an instinct of gale's or perhaps some suggestion in the husky thick whisper or dark face told gale to reach for his canteen
he lifted the indian and gave him a drink and if ever in all his life he saw gratitude in human eyes he saw it then
then he examined the injured yaqui not forgetting for an instant to send wary fugitive glances on all sides
gale was not surprised
the indian had three woundsa bullet hole in his shoulder a crushed arm and a badly lacerated leg
what had been the matter with him before being set upon by the raider gale could not be certain
the ranger thought rapidly
this yaqui would live unless left there to die or be murdered by the mexicans when they found courage to sneak back to the well
it never occurred to gale to abandon the poor fellow
that was where his old training the higher order of human feeling made impossible the following of any elemental instinct of selfpreservation
all the same gale knew he multiplied his perils a hundredfold by burdening himself with a crippled indian
swiftly he set to work and with rifle ever under his hand and shifting glance spared from his task he bound up the yaqui's wounds
at the same time he kept keen watch
the indians' burros and the horses of the raiders were all out of sight
time was too valuable for gale to use any in what might be a vain search
therefore he lifted the yaqui upon sol's broad shoulders and climbed into the saddle
at a word sol dropped his head and started eastward up the trail walking swiftly without resentment for his double burden
far ahead between two huge mesas where the trail mounted over a pass a long line of dust clouds marked the position of the horses that had escaped from the corral
those that had been stolen would travel straight and true for home and perhaps would lead the others with them
the raiders were left on the desert without guns or mounts
blanco sol walked or jogtrotted six miles to the hour
at that gait fifty miles would not have wet or turned a hair of his dazzling white coat
gale bearing in mind the everpresent possibility of encountering more raiders and of being pursued saved the strength of the horse
once out of sight of papago well gale dismounted and walked beside the horse steadying with one firm hand the helpless dangling yaqui
the sun cleared the eastern ramparts and the coolness of morning fled as if before a magic foe
the whole desert changed
the grays wore bright the mesquites glistened the cactus took the silver hue of frost and the rocks gleamed gold and red
then as the heat increased a wind rushed up out of the valley behind gale and the hotter the sun blazed down the swifter rushed the wind
the wonderful transparent haze of distance lost its bluish hue for one with tinge of yellow
flying sand made the peaks dimly outlined
gale kept pace with his horse
he bore the twinge of pain that darted through his injured hip at every stride
his eye roved over the wide smoky prospect seeking the landmarks he knew
when the wild and bold spurs of no name mountains loomed through a rent in flying clouds of sand he felt nearer home
another hour brought him abreast of a dark straight shaft rising clear from a beetling escarpment
this was a monument marking the international boundary line
when he had passed it he had his own country under foot
in the heat of midday he halted in the shade of a rock and lifting the yaqui down gave him a drink
then after a long sweeping survey of the surrounding desert he removed sol's saddle and let him roll and took for himself a welcome rest and a bite to eat
the yaqui was tenacious of life
he was still holding his own
for the first time gale really looked at the indian to study him
he had a large head nobly cast and a face that resembled a shrunken mask
it seemed chiseled in the darkred volcanic lava of his sooner wilderness
the indian's eyes were always black and mystic but this yaqui's encompassed all the tragic desolation of the desert
they were fixed on gale moved only when he moved
the indian was short and broad and his body showed unusual muscular development although he seemed greatly emaciated from starvation or illness
gale resumed his homeward journey
when he got through the pass he faced a great depression as rough as if millions of gigantic spikes had been driven by the hammer of thor into a seamed and cracked floor
this was altar valley
it was a chaos of arroyo's canyons rocks and ridges all mantled with cactus and at its eastern end it claimed the dry bed of forlorn river and water when there was any
with a wounded helpless man across the saddle this stretch of thorny and contorted desert was practically impassable
yet gale headed into it unflinchingly
he would carry the yaqui as far as possible or until death make the burden no longer a duty
blanco sol plodded on over the dragging sand up and down the steep loose banks of washes out on the rocks and through the rows of whitetoothed choyas
the sun sloped westward bending fiercer heat in vengeful parting reluctance
the wind slackened
the dust settled
and the bold forbidding front of no name mountains changed to red and gold
gale held grimly by the side of the tireless implacable horse holding the yaqui on the saddle taking the brunt of the merciless thorns
in the end it became heartrending toil
his heavy chaps dragged him down but he dared not go on without them for thick and stiff as they were the terrible steelbayoneted spikes of the choyas pierced through to sting his legs
to the last mile gale held to blanco sol's gait and kept everwatchful gaze ahead on the trail
then with the low flat houses of forlorn river shining red in the sunset gale flagged and rapidly weakened
the yaqui slipped out of the saddle and dropped limp in the sand
gale could not mount his horse
he clutched sol's long tail and twisted his hand in it and staggered on
blanco sol whistled a piercing blast
he scented cool water and sweet alfalfa hay
twinkling lights ahead meant rest
the melancholy desert twilight rapidly succeeded the sunset
it accentuated the forlorn loneliness of the gray winding river of sand and its grayer shores
night shadows trooped down from the black and looming mountains
vii  white horses  a crippled yaqui
why the hell did you saddle yourself with him
roared belding as he laid gale upon the bed
belding had grown hard these late violent weeks
because i chose whispered gale in reply
go after himhe dropped in the trailacross the rivernear the first big saguaro
belding began to swear as he fumbled with matches and the lamp but as the light flared up he stopped short in the middle of a word
you said you weren't hurt
he demanded in sharp anxiety as he bent over gale
i'm onlyall in  will you goor send some onefor the yaqui
sure dick sure belding replied in softer tones
then he stalked out his heels rang on the flagstones he opened a door and called mothergirls here's dick back
he's done up nowno no he's not hurt or in bad shape
you women
do what you can to make him comfortable
i've got a little job on hand
there were quick replies that gale's dulling ears did not distinguish
then it seemed mrs belding was beside his bed her presence so cool and soothing and helpful and mercedes and nell wideeyed and whitefaced were fluttering around him
he drank thirstily but refused food
he wanted rest
and with their faces drifting away in a kind of haze with the feeling of gentle hands about him he lost consciousness
he slept twenty hours
then he arose thirsty hungry lame overworn and presently went in search of belding and the business of the day
your yaqui was near dead but guess we'll pull him through said belding
dick the other day that indian came here by rail and foot and lord only knows how else all the way from new orleans
he spoke english better than most indians and i know a little yaqui
i got some of his story and guessed the rest
the mexican government is trying to root out the yaquis
a year ago his tribe was taken in chains to a mexican port on the gulf
the fathers mothers children were separated and put in ships bound for yucatan
there they were made slaves on the great henequen plantations
they were driven beaten starved
each slave had for a day's rations a hunk of sour dough no more
yucatan is low marshy damp hot
the yaquis were bred on the high dry sonoran plateau where the air is like a knife
they dropped dead in the henequen fields and their places were taken by more
you see the mexicans won't kill outright in their war of extermination of the yaquis
they get use out of them
it's a horrible thing well this yaqui you brought in escaped from his captors got aboard ship and eventually reached new orleans
somehow he traveled way out here
i gave him a bag of food and he went off with a papago indian
he was a sick man then
and he must have fallen foul of some greasers
gale told of his experience at papago well
that raider who tried to grind the yaqui under a horse's hoofshe was a hyena
concluded gale shuddering
i've seen some blood spilled and some hard sights but that inhuman devil took my nerve
why as i told you belding i missed a shot at himnot twenty paces
dick in cases like that the sooner you clean up the bunch the better said belding grimly
as for hard sightswait till you've seen a yaqui do up a mexican
bar none that is the limit
it's blood lust a racial hate deep as life and terrible
the spaniards crushed the aztecs four or five hundred years ago
that hate has had time to grow as deep as a cactus root
the yaquis are mountain aztecs
personally i think they are noble and intelligent and if let alone would be peaceable and industrious
i like the few i've known
but they are a doomed race
have you any idea what ailed this yaqui before the raider got in his work
no i haven't
i noticed the indian seemed in bad shape but i couldn't tell what was the matter with him
well my idea is another personal one
maybe it's off color
i think that yaqui was or is for that matter dying of a broken heart
all he wanted was to get back to his mountains and die
there are no yaquis left in that part of sonora he was bound for
he had a strange look in his eyes said gale thoughtfully
yes i noticed that
but all yaquis have a wild look
dick if i'm not mistaken this fellow was a chief
it was a waste of strength a needless risk for you to save him pack him back here
but damn the whole greaser outfit generally i'm glad you did
gale remembered then to speak of his concern for ladd
laddy didn't go out to meet you replied belding
i knew you were due in any day and as there's been trouble between here and casita i sent him that way
since you've been out our friend carter lost a bunch of horses and a few steers
did you get a good look at the horses those raiders had at papago well
dick had learned since he had become a ranger to see everything with keen sure photographic eye and being put to the test so often required of him he described the horses as a darkcolored drove mostly bays and blacks with one spotted sorrel
some of carter'ssure as you're born
exclaimed belding
his bunch has been split up divided among several bands of raiders
he has a grass ranch up here in three mile arroyo
it's a good long ride in u s territory from the border
those horses i saw will go home don't you think
asked dick
sure
they can't be caught or stopped
well what shall i do now
stay here and rest bluntly replied belding
you need it
let the women fuss over youdoctor you a little
when jim gets back from sonoyta i'll know more about what we ought to do
by lord
it seems our job now isn't keeping japs and chinks out of the u s it's keeping our property from going into mexico
are there any letters for me
asked gale
letters
say my boy it'd take something pretty important to get me or any man here back casita way
if the town is safe these days the road isn't
it's a month now since any one went to casita
gale had received several letters from his sister elsie the last of which he had not answered
there had not been much opportunity for writing on his infrequent returns to forlorn river and besides elsie had written that her father had stormed over what he considered dick's falling into wild and evil ways
time flies said dick
george thorne will be free before long and he'll be coming out
i wonder if he'll stay here or try to take mercedes away
well he'll stay right here in forlorn river if i have any say replied belding
i'd like to know how he'd ever get that spanish girl out of the country now with all the trails overrun by rebels and raiders
it'd be hard to disguise her
say dick maybe we can get thorne to stay here
you know since you've discovered the possibility of a big water supply i've had dreams of a future for forlorn river
if only this war was over
dick that's what it iswarscattered war along the northern border of mexico from gulf to gulf
what if it isn't our war
we're on the fringe
no we can't develop forlorn river until there's peace
the discovery that belding alluded to was one that might very well lead to the making of a wonderful and agricultural district of altar valley
while in college dick gale had studied engineering but he had not set the scientific world afire with his brilliance
nor after leaving college had he been able to satisfy his father that he could hold a job
nevertheless his smattering of engineering skill bore fruit in the last place on earth where anything might have been expected of itin the desert
gale had always wondered about the source of forlorn river
no white man or mexican or so far as known no indian had climbed those mighty broken steps of rock called no name mountains from which forlorn river was supposed to come
gale had discovered a long narrow rockbottomed and rockwalled gulch that could be dammed at the lower end by the dynamiting of leaning cliffs above
an inexhaustible supply of water could be stored there
furthermore he had worked out an irrigation plan to bring the water down for mining uses and to make a paradise out of that part of altar valley which lay in the united states
belding claimed there was gold in the arroyos gold in the gulches not in quantities to make a prospector rejoice but enough to work for
and the soil on the higher levels of altar valley needed only water to make it grow anything the year round
gale too had come to have dreams of a future for forlorn river
on the afternoon of the following day ladd unexpectedly appeared leading a lame and lathered horse into the yard
belding and gale who were at work at the forge looked up and were surprised out of speech
the legs of the horse were raw and red and he seemed about to drop
ladd's sombrero was missing he wore a bloody scarf round his head sweat and blood and dust had formed a crust on his face little streams of powdery dust slid from him and the lower half of his scarred chaps were full of broken white thorns
howdy boys he drawled
i shore am glad to see you all
where'n hell's your hat
demanded belding furiously
it was a ridiculous greeting
but belding's words signified little
the dark shade of worry and solicitude crossing his face told more than his black amaze
the ranger stopped unbuckling the saddle girths and looking at belding broke into his slow cool laugh
tom you recollect that whopper of a saguaro up here where carter's trail branches off the main trail to casita
well i climbed it an' left my hat on top for a woodpecker's nest
you've been runningfighting
queried belding as if ladd had not spoken at all
i reckon it'll dawn on you after a while replied ladd slipping the saddle
laddy go in the house to the women said belding
i'll tend to your horse
shore tom in a minute
i've been down the road
an' i found hoss tracks an' steer tracks goin' across the line
but i seen no sign of raiders till this mornin'
slept at carter's last night
that raid the other day cleaned him out
he's shootin' mad
well this mornin' i rode plumb into a bunch of carter's hosses runnin' wild for home
some greasers were tryin' to head them round an' chase them back across the line
i rode in between an' made matters embarrassin'
carter's hosses got away
then me an' the greasers had a little game of hide an' seek in the cactus
i was on the wrong side an' had to break through their line to head toward home
we run some
but i had a closer call than i'm stuck on havin'
laddy you wouldn't have any such close calls if you'd ride one of my horses expostulated belding
this broncho of yours can run and lord knows he's game
but you want a big strong horse mexican bred with cactus in his blood
take one of the bunchbull white woman blanco jose
i had a big fast horse a while back but i lost him said ladd
this bronch ain't so bad
shore bull an' that white devil with his greaser namethey could run down my bronch kill him in a mile of cactus
but somehow tom i can't make up my mind to take one of them grand white hosses
shore i reckon i'm kinda soft
an' mebbe i'd better take one before the raiders clean up forlorn river
belding cursed low and deep in his throat and the sound resembled muttering thunder
the shade of anxiety on his face changed to one of dark gloom and passion
next to his wife and daughter there was nothing so dear to him as those white horses
his father and grandfatherall his progenitors of whom he had tracehad been lovers of horses
it was in belding's blood
laddy before it's too late can't i get the whites away from the border
mebbe it ain't too late but where can we take them
to san felipe
no
we've more chance to hold them here
to casita and the railroad
afraid to risk gettin' there
an' the town's full of rebels who need hosses
then straight north
shore man you're crazy
ther's no water no grass for a hundred miles
i'll tell you tom the safest plan would be to take the white bunch south into sonora into some wild mountain valley
keep them there till the raiders have traveled on back east
pretty soon there won't be any rich pickin' left for these greasers
an' then they'll ride on to new ranges
laddy i don't know the trails into sonora
an' i can't trust a mexican or a papago
between you and me i'm afraid of this indian who herds for me
i reckon we'd better stick here tom dick it's some good to see you again
but you seem kinda quiet
shore you get quieter all the time
did you see any sign of jim out sonoyta way
then belding led the lame horse toward the wateringtrough while the two rangers went toward the house dick was telling ladd about the affair at papago well when they turned the corner under the porch
nell was sitting in the door
she rose with a little scream and came flying toward them
now i'll get it whispered ladd
the women'll make a baby of me
an' shore i can't help myself
oh laddy you've been hurt
cried nell as with white cheeks and dilating eyes she ran to him and caught his arm
nell i only run a thorn in my ear
oh laddy don't lie
you've lied before
i know you're hurt
come in to mother
shore nell it's only a scratch
my bronch throwed me
laddy no horse every threw you
the girl's words and accusing eyes only hurried the ranger on to further duplicity
mebbe i got it when i was ridin' hard under a mesquite an' a sharp snag  you've been shot
mama here's laddy and he's been shot
oh these dreadful days we're having
i can't bear them
forlorn river used to be so safe and quiet
nothing happened
but now
jim comes home with a bloody hole in himthen dickthen laddy
oh i'm afraid some day they'll never come home
the morning was bright still and clear as crystal
the heat waves had not yet begun to rise from the desert
a soft gray white and green tint perfectly blended lay like a mantle over mesquite and sand and cactus
the canyons of distant mountain showed deep and full of lilac haze
nell sat perched high upon the topmost bar of the corral gate
dick leaned beside her now with his eyes on her face now gazing out into the alfalfa field where belding's thoroughbreds grazed and pranced and romped and whistled
nell watched the horses
she loved them never tired of watching them
but her gaze was too consciously averted from the yearning eyes that tried to meet hers to be altogether natural
a great fenced field of dark velvety green alfalfa furnished a rich background for the drove of about twenty white horses
even without the horses the field would have presented a striking contrast to the surrounding hot glaring blaze of rock and sand
belding had bred a hundred or more horses from the original stock he had brought up from durango
his particular interest was in the almost unblemished whites and these he had given especial care
he made a good deal of money selling this strain to friends among the ranchers back in texas
no mercenary consideration however could have made him part with the great rangy white horses he had gotten from the durango breeder
he called them blanco diablo white devil blanco sol white sun blanca reina white queen blanca mujer white woman and el gran toro blanco the big white bull
belding had been laughed at by ranchers for preserving the sentimental durango names and he had been unmercifully ridiculed by cowboys
but the names had never been changed
blanco diablo was the only horse in the field that was not free to roam and graze where he listed
a stake and a halter held him to one corner where he was severely let alone by the other horses
he did not like this isolation
blanco diablo was not happy unless he was running or fighting a rival
of the two he would rather fight
if anything white could resemble a devil this horse surely did
he had nothing beautiful about him yet he drew the gaze and held it
the look of him suggested discontent anger revolt viciousness
when he was not grazing or prancing he held his long lean head level pointing his nose and showing his teeth
belding's favorite was almost all the world to him and he swore diablo could stand more heat and thirst and cactus than any other horse he owned and could run down and kill any horse in the southwest
the fact that ladd did not agree with belding on these salient points was a great disappointment and also a perpetual source for argument
ladd and lash both hated diablo and dick gale after one or two narrow escapes from being brained had inclined to the cowboys' side of the question
el gran toro blanco upheld his name
he was a huge massive thickflanked stallion a kingly mate for his fullbodied glossy consort blanca reina
the other mare blanca mujer was dazzling white without a spot perfectly pointed racy graceful elegant yet carrying weight and brawn and range that suggested her relation to her forebears
the cowboys admitted some of belding's claims for diablo but they gave loyal and unshakable allegiance to blanco sol
as for dick he had to fight himself to keep out of arguments for he sometimes imagined he was unreasonable about the horse
though he could not understand himself he knew he loved sol as a man loved a friend a brother
free of heavy saddle and the clumsy leg shields blanco sol was somehow allsatisfying to the eyes of the rangers
as long and big as diablo was sol was longer and bigger
also he was higher more powerful
he looked more a thing for actionspeedier
at a distance the honorable scars and lumps that marred his muscular legs were not visible
he grazed aloof from the others and did not cavort nor prance but when he lifted his head to whistle how wild he appeared and proud and splendid
the dazzling whiteness of the desert sun shone from his coat he had the fire and spirit of the desert in his noble head  its strength and power in his gigantic frame
belding swears sol never beat diablo dick was saying
he believes it replied nell
dad is queer about that horse
but laddy rode sol oncemade him beat diablo
jim saw the race
nell laughed
i saw it too
for that matter even i have made sol put his nose before dad's favorite
i'd like to have seen that
nell aren't you ever going to ride with me
some daywhen it's safe
safe
ii mean when the raiders have left the border
oh i'm glad you mean that said dick laughing
well i've often wondered how belding ever came to give blanco sol to me
he was jealous
i think he wanted to get rid of sol
no
why nell he'd give laddy or jim one of the whites any day
would he
not devil or queen or white woman
never in this world
but dad has lots of fast horses the boys could pick from
dick i tell you dad wants blanco sol to run himself outlose his speed on the desert
dad is just jealous for diablo
maybe
he surely has strange passion for horses
i think i understand better than i used to
i owned a couple of racers once
they were just animals to me i guess
but blanco sol
do you love him
asked nell and now a warm blue flash of eyes swept his face
do i
well rather
i'm glad
sol has been finer a better horse since you owned him
he loves you dick
he's always watching for you
see him raise his head
that's for you
i know as much about horses as dad or laddy any day
sol always hated diablo and he never had much use for dad
dick looked up at her
it'll bebe pretty hard to leave solwhen i go away
nell sat perfectly still
go away
she asked presently with just the faintest tremor in her voice
yes
sometimes when i get blueas i am todayi think i'll go
but in sober truth nell it's not likely that i'll spend all my life here
there was no answer to this
dick put his hand softly over hers and despite her halfhearted struggle to free it he held on
nell
her color fled
he saw her lips part
then a heavy step on the gravel a cheerful complaining voice interrupted him and made him release nell and draw back
belding strode into view round the adobe shed
hey dick that darned yaqui indian can't be driven or hired or coaxed to leave forlorn river
he's well enough to travel
i offered him horse gun blanket grub
but no go
that's funny replied gale with a smile
let him stayput him to work
it doesn't strike me funny
but i'll tell you what i think
that poor homeless heartbroken indian has taken a liking to you dick
these desert yaquis are strange folk
i've heard strange stories about them
i'd believe 'most anything
and that's how i figure his case
you saved his life
that sort of thing counts big with any indian even with an apache
with a yaqui maybe it's of deep significance
i've heard a yaqui say that with his tribe no debt to friend or foe ever went unpaid
perhaps that's what ails this fellow
dick don't laugh said nell
i've noticed the yaqui
it's pathetic the way his great gloomy eyes follow you
you've made a friend continued belding
a yaqui could be a real friend on this desert
if he gets his strength back he'll be of service to you don't mistake me
he's welcome here
but you're responsible for him and you'll have trouble keeping him from massacring all the greasers in forlorn river
the probability of a visit from the raiders and a dash bolder than usual on the outskirts of a ranch led belding to build a new corral
it was not sightly to the eye but it was high and exceedingly strong
the gate was a massive affair swinging on huge hinges and fastening with heavy chains and padlocks
on the outside it had been completely covered with barb wire which would make it a troublesome thing to work on in the dark
at night belding locked his white horses in this corral
the papago herdsman slept in the adobe shed adjoining
belding did not imagine that any wooden fence however substantially built could keep determined raiders from breaking it down
they would have to take time however and make considerable noise and belding relied on these facts
belding did not believe a band of night raiders would hold out against a hot rifle fire
so he began to make up some of the sleep he had lost
it was noteworthy however that ladd did not share belding's sanguine hopes
jim lash rode in reporting that all was well out along the line toward the sonoyta oasis
days passed and belding kept his rangers home
nothing was heard of raiders at hand
many of the newcomers both american and mexican who came with wagons and pack trains from casita stated that property and life were cheap back in that rebelinfested town
one january morning dick gale was awakened by a shrill menacing cry
he leaped up bewildered and frightened
he heard belding's booming voice answering shouts and rapid steps on flagstones
but these had not awakened him
heavy breaths almost sobs seemed at his very door
in the cold and gray dawn dick saw something white
gun in hand he bounded across the room
just outside his door stood blanco sol
it was not unusual for sol to come poking his head in at dick's door during daylight
but now in the early dawn when he had been locked in the corral it meant raidersno less
dick called softly to the snorting horse and hurriedly getting into clothes and boots he went out with a gun in each hand
sol was quivering in every muscle
like a dog he followed dick around the house
hearing shouts in the direction of the corrals gale bent swift steps that way
he caught up with jim lash who was also leading a white horse
hello jim
guess it's all over but the fireworks said dick
i cain't say just what has come off replied lash
i've got the bull
found him runnin' in the yard
they reached the corral to find belding shaking roaring like a madman
the gate was open the corral was empty
ladd stooped over the ground evidently trying to find tracks
i reckon we might jest as well cool off an' wait for daylight suggested jim
shore
they've flown the coop you can gamble on that
tom where's the papago
said ladd
he's gone laddygone
doublecrossed us eh
i see here's a crowbar lyin' by the gatepost
that indian fetched it from the forge
it was used to pry out the bolts an' steeples
tom i reckon there wasn't much time lost forcin' that gate
belding in shirt sleeves and barefooted roared with rage
he said he had heard the horses running as he leaped out of bed
what woke you
asked laddy
sol
he came whistling for dick
didn't you hear him before i called you
hear him
he came thunderin' right under my window
i jumped up in bed an' when he let out that blast jim lit square in the middle of the floor an' i was scared stiff
dick seein' it was your room he blew into what did you think
i couldn't think
i'm shaking yet laddy
boys i'll bet sol spilled a few raiders if any got hands on him said jim
now let's sit down an' wait for daylight
it's my idea we'll find some of the hosses runnin' loose
tom you go an' get some clothes on
it's freezin' cold
an' don't forget to tell the women folks we're all right
daylight made clear some details of the raid
the cowboys found tracks of eight raiders coming up from the river bed where their horses had been left
evidently the papago had been false to his trust
his few personal belongings were gone
lash was correct in his idea of finding more horses loose in the fields
the men soon rounded up eleven of the whites all more or less frightened and among the number were queen and blanca mujer
the raiders had been unable to handle more than one horse for each man
it was bitter irony of fate that belding should lose his favorite the one horse more dear to him than all the others
somewhere out on the trail a raider was fighting the ironjawed savage blanco diablo
i reckon we're some lucky observed jim lash
lucky ain't enough word replied ladd
you see it was this way
some of the raiders piled over the fence while the others worked on the gate
mebbe the papago went inside to pick out the best hosses
but it didn't work except with diablo an' how they ever got him i don't know
i'd have gambled it'd take all of eight men to steal him
but greasers have got us skinned on handlin' hosses
belding was unconsolable
he cursed and railed and finally declared he was going to trail the raiders
tom you just ain't agoin' to do nothin' of the kind said ladd coolly
belding groaned and bowed his head
laddy you're right he replied presently
i've got to stand it
i can't leave the women and my property
but it's sure tough
i'm sore way down deep and nothin' but blood would ever satisfy me
leave that to me an' jim said ladd
what do you mean to do
demanded belding starting up
shore i don't know yet give me a light for my pipe
an' dick go fetch out your yaqui
viii  the running of blanco sol  the yaqui's strange dark glance roved over the corral the swinging gate with its broken fastenings the tracks in the road and then rested upon belding
malo he said and his spanish was clear
shore yaqui about eight bad men an' a traitor indian said ladd
i think he means my herder added belding
if he does that settles any doubt it might be decent to haveyaquimalo papagosi
the yaqui spread wide his hands
then he bent over the tracks in the road
they led everywhither but gradually he worked out of the thick net to take the trail that the cowboys had followed down to the river
belding and the rangers kept close at his heels
occasionally dick lent a helping hand to the still feeble indian
he found a trampled spot where the raiders had left their horses
from this point a deeply defined narrow trail led across the dry river bed
belding asked the yaqui where the raiders would head for in the sonora desert
for answer the indian followed the trail across the stream of sand through willows and mesquite up to the level of rock and cactus
at this point he halted
a sandfilled almost obliterated trail led off to the left and evidently went round to the east of no name mountains
to the right stretched the road toward papago well and the sonoyta oasis
the trail of the raiders took a southeasterly course over untrodden desert
the yaqui spoke in his own tongue then in spanish
think he means slow march said belding
laddy from the looks of that trail the greasers are having trouble with the horses
tom shore a boy could see that replied laddy
ask yaqui to tell us where the raiders are headin' an' if there's water
it was wonderful to see the yaqui point
his dark hand stretched he sighted over his stretched finger at a low white escarpment in the distance
then with a stick he traced a line in the sand and then at the end of that another line at right angles
he made crosses and marks and holes and as he drew the rude map he talked in yaqui in spanish with a word here and there in english
belding translated as best he could
the raiders were heading southeast toward the railroad that ran from nogales down into sonora
it was four days' travel bad trail good sure waterhole one day out then water not sure for two days
raiders traveling slow bothered by too many horses not looking for pursuit were never pursued could be headed and ambushed that night at the first waterhole a natural trap in a valley
the men returned to the ranch
the rangers ate and drank while making hurried preparations for travel
blanco sol and the cowboys' horses were fed watered and saddled
ladd again refused to ride one of belding's whites
he was quick and cold
get me a longrange rifle an' lots of shells
rustle now he said
laddy you don't want to be weighted down
protested belding
shore i want a gun that'll outshoot the dinky little carbines an' muskets used by the rebels
trot one out an' be quick
i've got a  a longbarreled heavy rifle that'll shoot a mile
i use it for mountain sheep
but laddy it'll break that bronch's back
his back won't break so easy dick take plenty of shells for your remington
an' don't forget your field glass
in less than an hour after the time of the raid the three rangers heavily armed and superbly mounted on fresh horses rode out on the trail
as gale turned to look back from the far bank of forlorn river he saw nell waving a white scarf
he stood high in his stirrups and waved his sombrero
then the mesquites hid the girl's slight figure and gale wheeled grimfaced to follow the  rangers
they rode in single file with ladd in the lead
he did not keep to the trail of the raiders all the time
he made short cuts
the raiders were traveling leisurely and they evinced a liking for the most level and least cactuscovered stretches of ground
but the cowboy took a beeline course for the white escarpment pointed out by the yaqui and nothing save deep washes and impassable patches of cactus or rocks made him swerve from it
he kept the broncho at a steady walk over the rougher places and at a swinging indian canter over the hard and level ground
the sun grew hot and the wind began to blow
dust clouds rolled along the blue horizon
whirling columns of sand like water spouts at sea circled up out of white arid basins and swept away and spread aloft before the wind
the escarpment began to rise to change color to show breaks upon its rocky face
whenever the rangers rode out on the brow of a knoll or ridge or an eminence before starting to descend ladd required of gale a long careful sweeping survey of the desert ahead through the field glass
there were streams of white dust to be seen streaks of yellow dust trailing low clouds of sand over the glistening dunes but no steadily rising uniformly shaped puffs that would tell a tale of moving horses on the desert
at noon the rangers got out of the thick cactus
moreover the gravelbottomed washes the low weathering rotting ledges of yellow rock gave place to hard sandy rolls and bare clay knolls
the desert resembled a rounded hummocky sea of color
all light shades of blue and pink and yellow and mauve were there dominated by the glaring white sun
mirages glistened wavered faded in the shimmering waves of heat
dust as fine as powder whiffed up from under the tireless hoofs
the rangers rode on and the escarpment began to loom
the desert floor inclined perceptibly upward
when gale got an unobstructed view of the slope of the escarpment he located the raiders and horses
in another hour's travel the rangers could see with naked eyes a long faint moving streak of black and white dots
they're headin' for that yellow pass said ladd pointing to a break in the eastern end of the escarpment
when they get out of sight we'll rustle
i'm thinkin' that waterhole the yaqui spoke of lays in the pass
the rangers traveled swiftly over the remaining miles of level desert leading to the ascent of the escarpment
when they achieved the gateway of the pass the sun was low in the west
dwarfed mesquite and greasewood appeared among the rocks
ladd gave the word to tie up horses and go forward on foot
the narrow neck of the pass opened and descended into a valley half a mile wide perhaps twice that in length
it had apparently unscalable slopes of weathered rock leading up to beetling walls
with floor bare and hard and white except for a patch of green mesquite near the far end it was a lurid and desolate spot the barren bottom of a desert bowl
keep down boys said ladd
there's the waterhole an' hosses have sharp eyes
shore the yaqui figgered this place
i never seen its like for a trap
both white and black horses showed against the green and a thin curling column of blue smoke rose lazily from amid the mesquites
i reckon we'd better wait till dark or mebbe daylight said jim lash
let me figger some
dick what do you make of the outlet to this hole
looks rough to me
with his glass gale studied the narrow construction of walls and roughened rising floor
laddy it's harder to get out at that end than here he replied
shore that's hard enough
let me have a look well boys it don't take no figgerin' for this job
jim i'll want you at the other end blockin' the pass when we're ready to start
when'll that be
inquired jim
soon as it's light enough in the mornin'
that greaser outfit will hang till tomorrow
there's no sure water ahead for two days you remember
i reckon i can slip through to the other end after dark said lash thoughtfully
it might get me in bad to go round
the rangers stole back from the vantage point and returned to their horses which they untied and left farther round among broken sections of cliff
for the horses it was a dry hungry camp but the rangers built a fire and had their short though strengthening meal
the location was high and through a break in the jumble of rocks the great colored void of desert could be seen rolling away endlessly to the west
the sun set and after it had gone down the golden tips of mountains dulled their lower shadows creeping upward
jim lash rolled in his saddle blanket his feet near the fire and went to sleep
ladd told gale to do likewise while he kept the fire up and waited until it was late enough for jim to undertake circling round the raiders
when gale awakened the night was dark cold windy
the stars shone with white brilliance
jim was up saddling his horse and ladd was talking low
when gale rose to accompany them both rangers said he need not go
but gale wanted to go because that was the thing ladd or jim would have done
with ladd leading they moved away into the gloom
advance was exceedingly slow careful silent
under the walls the blackness seemed impenetrable
the horse was as cautious as his master
ladd did not lose his way nevertheless he wound between blocks of stone and clumps of mesquite and often tried a passage to abandon it
finally the trail showed pale in the gloom and eastern stars twinkled between the lofty ramparts of the pass
the advance here was still as stealthily made as before but not so difficult or slow
when the dense gloom of the pass lightened and there was a wide space of sky and stars overhead ladd halted and stood silent a moment
luck again
he whispered
the wind's in your face jim
the horses won't scent you
go slow
don't crack a stone
keep close under the wall
try to get up as high as this at the other end
wait till daylight before riskin' a loose slope
i'll be ridin' the job early
that's all
ladd's cool easy speech was scarcely significant of the perilous undertaking
lash moved very slowly away leading his horse
the soft pads of hoofs ceased to sound about the time the gray shape merged into the black shadows
then ladd touched dick's arm and turned back up the trail
but dick tarried a moment
he wanted a fuller sense of that ebonybottomed abyss with its pale encircling walls reaching up to the dusky blue sky and the brilliant stars
there was absolutely no sound
he retraced his steps down soon coming up with ladd and together they picked a way back through the winding recesses of cliff
the campfire was smoldering
ladd replenished it and lay down to get a few hours' sleep while gale kept watch
the after part of the night wore on till the paling of stars the thickening of gloom indicated the dark hour before dawn
the spot was secluded from wind but the air grew cold as ice
gale spent the time stripping wood from a dead mesquite in pacing to and fro in listening
blanco sol stamped occasionally which sound was all that broke the stilliness
ladd awoke before the faintest gray appeared
the rangers ate and drank
when the black did lighten to gray they saddled the horses and led them out to the pass and down to the point where they had parted with lash
here they awaited daylight
to gale it seemed long in coming
such a delay always aggravated the slow fire within him
he had nothing of ladd's patience
he wanted action
the gray shadow below thinned out and the patch of mesquite made a blot upon the pale valley
the day dawned
still ladd waited
he grew more silent grimmer as the time of action approached
gale wondered what the plan of attack would be
yet he did not ask
he waited ready for orders
the valley grew clear of gray shadow except under leaning walls on the eastern side
then a straight column of smoke rose from among the mesquites
manifestly this was what ladd had been awaiting
he took the long  from its sheath and tried the lever
then he lifted a cartridge belt from the pommel of his saddle
every ring held a shell and these shells were four inches long
he buckled the belt round him
come on dick
ladd led the way down the slope until he reached a position that commanded the rising of the trail from a level
it was the only place a man or horse could leave the valley for the pass
dick here's your stand
if any raider rides in range take a crack at him now i want the lend of your hoss
blanco sol
exclaimed gale more in amazement that ladd should ask for the horse than in reluctance to lend him
will you let me have him
ladd repeated almost curtly
certainly laddy
a smile momentarily chased the dark cold gloom that had set upon the ranger's lean face
shore i appreciate it dick
i know how you care for that hoss
i guess mebbe charlie ladd has loved a hoss
an' one not so good as sol
i was only tryin' your nerve dick askin' you without tellin' my plan
sol won't get a scratch you can gamble on that
i'll ride him down into the valley an' pull the greasers out in the open
they've got shortranged carbines
they can't keep out of range of the  an' i'll be takin' the dust of their lead
sabe senor
laddy
you'll run sol away from the raiders when they chase you
run him after them when they try to get away
shore
i'll run all the time
they can't gain on sol an' he'll run them down when i want
can you beat it
no
it's great
but suppose a raider comes out on blanco diablo
i reckon that's the one weak place in my plan
i'm figgerin' they'll never think of that till it's too late
but if they do well sol can outrun diablo
an' i can always kill the white devil
ladd's strange hate of the horse showed in the passion of his last words in his hardening jaw and grim set lips
gale's hand went swiftly to the ranger's shoulder
laddy
don't kill diablo unless it's to save your life
all right
but by god if i get a chance i'll make blanco sol run him off his legs
he spoke no more and set about changing the length of sol's stirrups
when he had them adjusted to suit he mounted and rode down the trail and out upon the level
he rode leisurely as if merely going to water his horse
the long black rifle lying across his saddle however was ominous
gale securely tied the other horse to a mesquite at hand and took a position behind a low rock over which he could easily see and shoot when necessary
he imagined jim lash in a similar position at the far end of the valley blocking the outlet
gale had grown accustomed to danger and the hard and fierce feelings peculiar to it
but the coming drama was so peculiarly different in promise from all he had experienced that he waited the moment of action with thrilling intensity
in him stirred long brooding wrath at these border raidersaffection for belding and keen desire to avenge the outrages he had sufferedwarm admiration for the cold implacable ladd and his absolute fearlessness and a curious throbbing interest in the old muchdiscussed and neverdecided argument as to whether blanco sol was fleeter stronger horse than blanco diablo
gale felt that he was to see a race between these great rivalsthe kind of race that made men and horses terrible
ladd rode a quarter of a mile out upon the flat before anything happened
then a whistle rent the still cold air
a horse had seen or scented blanco sol
the whistle was prolonged faint but clear
it made the blood thrum in gale's ears
sol halted
his head shot up with the old wild spirited sweep
gale leveled his glass at the patch of mesquites
he saw the raiders running to an open place pointing gesticulating
the glass brought them so close that he saw the dark faces
suddenly they broke and fled back among the trees
then he got only white and dark gleams of moving bodies
evidently that moment was one of boots guns and saddles for the raiders
lowering the glass gale saw that blanco sol had started forward again
his gait was now a canter and he had covered another quarter of a mile before horses and raiders appeared upon the outskirts of the mesquites
then blanco sol stopped
his shrill ringing whistle came distinctly to gale's ears
the raiders were mounted on dark horses and they stood abreast in a motionless line
gale chuckled as he appreciated what a puzzle the situation presented for them
a lone horseman in the middle of the valley did not perhaps seem so menacing himself as the possibilities his presence suggested
then gale saw a raider gallop swiftly from the group toward the farther outlet of the valley
this might have been owing to characteristic cowardice but it was more likely a move of the raiders to make sure of retreat
undoubtedly ladd saw this galloping horseman
a few waiting moments ensued
the galloping horseman reached the slope began to climb
with naked eyes gale saw a puff of white smoke spring out of the rocks
then the raider wheeled his plunging horse back to the level and went racing wildly down the valley
the compact bunch of bays and blacks seemed to break apart and spread rapidly from the edge of the mesquites
puffs of white smoke indicated firing and showed the nature of the raiders' excitement
they were far out of ordinary range but they spurred toward ladd shooting as they rode
ladd held his ground the big white horse stood like a rock in his tracks
gale saw little spouts of dust rise in front of blanco sol and spread swift as sight to his rear
the raiders' bullets striking low were skipping along the hard bare floor of the valley
then ladd raised the long rifle
there was no smoke but three high spanging reports rang out
a gap opened in the dark line of advancing horsemen then a riderless steed sheered off to the right
blanco sol seemed to turn as on a pivot and charged back toward the lower end of the valley
he circled over to gale's right and stretched out into his run
there were now five raiders in pursuit and they came sweeping down yelling and shooting evidently sure of their quarry
ladd reserved his fire
he kept turning from back to front in his saddle
gale saw how the space widened between pursuers and pursued saw distinctly when ladd eased up sol's running
manifestly ladd intended to try to lead the raiders round in front of gale's position and presently gale saw he was going to succeed
the raiders riding like vaqueros swept on in a curve cutting off what distance they could
one fellow a small wiry rider high on his mount's neck like a jockey led his companions by many yards
he seemed to be getting the range of ladd or else he shot high for his bullets did not strike up the dust behind sol
gale was ready to shoot
blanco sol pounded by his rapid rhythmic hoofbeats plainly to be heard
he was running easily
gale tried to still the jump of heart and pulse and turned his eye again on the nearest pursuer
this raider was crossing in his carbine held muzzle up in his right hand and he was coming swiftly
it was a long shot upward of five hundred yards
gale had not time to adjust the sights of the remington but he knew the gun and holding coarsely upon the swiftly moving blot he began to shoot
the first bullet sent up a great splash of dust beneath the horse's nose making him leap as if to hurdle a fence
the rifle was automatic gale needed only to pull the trigger
he saw now that the raiders behind were in line
swiftly he worked the trigger
suddenly the leading horse leaped convulsively not up nor aside but straight ahead and then he crashed to the ground throwing his rider like a catapult and then slid and rolled
he half got up fell back and kicked but his rider never moved
the other raiders sawed the reins of plunging steeds and whirled to escape the unseen battery
gale slipped a fresh clip into the magazine of his rifle
he restrained himself from useless firing and gave eager eye to the duel below
ladd began to shoot while sol was running
the  rang out sharplythen again
the heavy bullets streaked the dust all the way across the valley
ladd aimed deliberately and pulled slowly unmindful of the kicking dustpuffs behind sol and to the side
the raiders spurred madly in pursuit loading and firing
they shot ten times while ladd shot once and all in vain and on ladd's sixth shot a raider topped backward threw his carbine and fell with his foot catching in a stirrup
the frightened horse plunged away dragging him in a path of dust
gale had set himself to miss nothing of that fighting race yet the action passed too swiftly for clear sight of all
ladd had emptied a magazine and now blanco sol quickened and lengthened his running stride
he ran away from his pursuers
then it was that the ranger's ruse was divined by the raiders
they hauled sharply up and seemed to be conferring
but that was a fatal mistake
blanco sol was seen to break his gait and slow down in several jumps then square away and stand stockstill
ladd fired at the closely grouped raiders
an instant passed
then gale heard the spat of a bullet out in front saw a puff of dust then heard the lead strike the rocks and go whining away
and it was after this that one of the raiders fell prone from his saddle
the steeljacketed  had gone through him on its uninterrupted way to hum past gale's position
the remaining two raiders frantically spurred their horses and fled up the valley
ladd sent sol after them
it seemed to gale even though he realized his excitement that blanco sol made those horses seem like snails
the raiders split one making for the eastern outlet the other circling back of the mesquites
ladd kept on after the latter
then puffs of white smoke and rifle shots faintly crackling told jim lash's hand in the game
however he succeeded only in driving the raider back into the valley
but ladd had turned the other horseman and now it appeared the two raiders were between lash above on the stony slope and ladd below on the level
there was desperate riding on part of the raiders to keep from being hemmed in closer
only one of them got away and he came riding for life down under the eastern wall
blanco sol settled into his graceful beautiful swing
he gained steadily though he was far from extending himself
by gale's actual count the raider fired eight times in that race down the valley and all his bullets went low and wide
he pitched the carbine away and lost all control in headlong flight
some few hundred rods to the left of gale the raider put his horse to the weathered slope
he began to climb
the horse was superb infinitely more courageous than his rider
zigzag they went up and up and when ladd reached the edge of the slope they were high along the cracked and guttered rampart
oncetwice ladd raised the long rifle but each time he lowered it
gale divined that the ranger's restraint was not on account of the mexican but for that valiant and faithful horse
up and up he went and the yellow dust clouds rose and an avalanche rolled rattling and cracking down the slope
it was beyond belief that a horse burdened or unburdened could find footing and hold it upon that wall of narrow ledges and inverted slanting gullies
but he climbed on surefooted as a mountain goat and surmounting the last rough steps he stood a moment silhouetted against the white sky
then he disappeared
ladd sat astride blanco sol gazing upward
how the cowboy must have honored that raider's brave steed
gale who had been too dumb to shout the admiration he felt suddenly leaped up and his voice came with a shriek  look out laddy
a big horse like a white streak was bearing down to the right of the ranger
blanco diablo
a matchless rider swung with the horse's motion
gale was stunned
then he remembered the first raider the one lash had shot at and driven away from the outlet
this fellow had made for the mesquite and had put a saddle on belding's favorite
in the heat of the excitement while ladd had been intent upon the climbing horse this last raider had come down with the speed of the wind straight for the western outlet
perhaps very probably he did not know gale was there to block it and certainly he hoped to pass ladd and blanco sol
a touch of the spur made sol lunge forward to head off the raider
diablo was in his stride but the distance and angle favored sol
the raider had no carbine
he held aloft a gun ready to level it and fire
he sat the saddle as if it were a stationary seat
gale saw ladd lean down and drop the  in the sand
he would take no chances of wounding belding's bestloved horse
then gale sat transfixed with suspended breath watching the horses thundering toward him
blanco diablo was speeding low fleet as an antelope fierce and terrible in his devilish action a horse for war and blood and death
he seemed unbeatable
yet to see the magnificently running blanco sol was but to court a doubt
gale stood spellbound
he might have shot the raider but he never thought of such a thing
the distance swiftly lessened
plain it was the raider could not make the opening ahead of ladd
he saw it and swerved to the left emptying his sixshooter as he turned
his dark face gleamed as he flashed by gale
blanco sol thundered across
then the race became straight away up the valley
diablo was cold and sol was hot therein lay the only handicap and vantage
it was a fleet beautiful magnificent race
gale thrilled and exulted and yelled as his horse settled into a steadily swifter run and began to gain
the dust rolled in a funnelshaped cloud from the flying hoofs
the raider wheeled with gun puffing white and ladd ducked low over the neck of his horse
the gap between diablo and sol narrowed yard by yard
at first it had been a wide one
the raider beat his mount and spurred beat and spurred wheeled round to shoot then bent forward again
in his circle at the upper end of the valley he turned far short of the jumble of rocks
all the devil that was in blanco diablo had its running on the downward stretch
the strange cruel urge of bit and spur the crazed rider who stuck like a burr upon him the shots and smoke added terror to his natural violent temper
he ran himself off his feet
but he could not elude that relentless horse behind him
the running of blanco sol was that of a sure remorseless driving powersteadierstrongerswifter with every long and wonderful stride
the raider tried to sheer diablo off closer under the wall to make the slope where his companion had escaped
but diablo was uncontrollable
he was running wild with breaking gait
closer and closer crept that white smoothly gliding beautiful machine of speed
then like one white flash following another the two horses gleamed down the bank of a wash and disappeared in clouds of dust
gale watched with strained and smarting eyes
the thick throb in his ears was pierced by faint sounds of gunshots
then he waited in almost unendurable suspense
suddenly something whiter than the background of dust appeared above the low roll of valley floor
gale leveled his glass
in the clear circle shone blanco sol's noble head with its long black bar from ears to nose
sol's head was drooping now
another second showed ladd still in the saddle
the ranger was leading blanco diablespentbrokendraggingriderless
ix  an interrupted siesta  no man ever had a more eloquent and beautiful pleader for his cause than had dick gale in mercedes castaneda
he peeped through the green shining twigs of the palo verde that shaded his door
the hour was high noon and the patio was sultry
the only sounds were the hum of bees in the flowers and the low murmur of the spanish girl's melodious voice
nell lay in the hammock her hands behind her head with rosy cheeks and arch eyes
indeed she looked rebellious
certain it was dick reflected that the young lady had fully recovered the wilful personality which had lain dormant for a while
equally certain it seemed that mercedes's earnestness was not apparently having the effect it should have had
dick was inclined to be rebellious himself
belding had kept the rangers in off the line and therefore dick had been idle most of the time and though he tried hard he had been unable to stay far from nell's vicinity
he believed she cared for him but he could not catch her alone long enough to verify his tormenting hope
when alone she was as illusive as a shadow as quick as a flash as mysterious as a yaqui
when he tried to catch her in the garden or fields or corner her in the patio she eluded him and left behind a memory of darkblue haunting eyes
it was that look in her eyes which lent him hope
at other times when it might have been possible for dick to speak nell clung closely to mercedes
he had long before enlisted the loyal mercedes in his cause but in spite of this nell had been more than a match for them both
gale pondered over an idea he had long revolved in mind and which now suddenly gave place to a decision that made his heart swell and his cheek burn
he peeped again through the green branches to see nell laughing at the fiery mercedes
qui'en sabe he called mockingly and was delighted with nell's quick amazed start
then he went in search of mrs belding and found her busy in the kitchen
the relation between gale and mrs belding had subtly and incomprehensively changed
he understood her less than when at first he divined an antagonism in her
if such a thing were possible she had retained the antagonism while seeming to yield to some influence that must have been fondness for him
gale was in no wise sure of her affection and he had long imagined she was afraid of him or of something that he represented
he had gone on openly and fairly though discreetly with his rather onesided love affair and as time passed he had grown less conscious of what had seemed her unspoken opposition
gale had come to care greatly for nell's mother
not only was she the comfort and strength of her home but also of the inhabitants of forlorn river
indian mexican american were all the same to her in trouble or illness and then she was nurse doctor peacemaker helper
she was good and noble and there was not a child or grownup in forlorn river who did not love and bless her
but mrs belding did not seem happy
she was brooding intense deep strong eager for the happiness and welfare of others and she was dominated by a worship of her daughter that was as strange as it was pathetic
mrs belding seldom smiled and never laughed
there was always a soft sad hurt look in her eyes
gale often wondered if there had been other tragedy in her life than the supposed loss of her father in the desert
perhaps it was the very unsolved nature of that loss which made it haunting
mrs belding heard dick's step as he entered the kitchen and looking up greeted him
mother began dick earnestly
belding called her that and so did ladd and lash but it was the first time for dick
motheri want to speak to you
the only indication mrs belding gave of being started was in her eyes which darkened shadowed with multiplying thought
i love nell went on dick simply and i want you to let me ask her to be my wife
mrs belding's face blanched to a deathly white
gale thinking with surprise and concern that she was going to faint moved quickly toward her took her arm
forgive me
i was blunt
but i thought you knew
i've known for a long time replied mrs belding
her voice was steady and there was no evidence of agitation except in her pallor
then youyou haven't spoken to nell
dick laughed
i've been trying to get a chance to tell her
i haven't had it yet
but she knows
there are other ways besides speech
and mercedes has told her
i hope i almost believe nell cares a little for me
i've known that too for a long time said mrs belding low almost as a whisper
you know
cried dick with a glow and rush of feeling
dick you must be very blind not to see what has been plain to all of us
i guessit couldn't have been helped
you're a splendid fellow
no wonder she loves you
mother
you'll give her to me
she drew him to the light and looked with strange piercing intentness into his face
gale had never dreamed a woman's eyes could hold such a world of thought and feeling
it seemed all the sweetness of life was there and all the pain
do you love her
she asked
with all my heart
you want to marry her
ah i want to
as much as i want to live and work for her
when would you marry her
why
just as soon as she will do it
tomorrow
dick gave a wild exultant little laugh
dick gale you want my nell
you love her just as she isher sweetnessher goodness
just herself body and soul
there's nothing could change younothing
dear mrs belding i love nell for herself
if she loves me i'll be the happiest of men
there's absolutely nothing that could make any difference in me
but your people
oh dick you come of a proud family
i can tell
ii once knew a young man like you
a few months can't change prideblood
years can't change them
you've become a ranger
you love the adventurethe wild life
that won't last
perhaps you'll settle down to ranching
i know you love the west
but dick there's your family  if you want to know anything about my family i'll tell you interrupted dick with strong feeling
i've not secrets about them or myself
my future and happiness are nell's to make
no one else shall count with me
then dickyou may have her
godblessyouboth
mrs belding's strained face underwent a swift and mobile relaxation and suddenly she was weeping in strangely mingled happiness and bitterness
why mother
gale could say no more
he did not comprehend a mood seemingly so utterly at variance with mrs belding's habitual temperament
but he put his arm around her
in another moment she had gained command over herself and kissing him she pushed him out of the door
there
go tell her dick and have some spunk about it
gale went thoughtfully back to his room
he vowed that he would answer for nell's happiness if he had the wonderful good fortune to win her
then remembering the hope mrs belding had given him dick lost his gravity in a flash and something began to dance and ring within him
he simply could not keep his steps turned from the patio
every path led there
his blood was throbbing his hopes mounting his spirit soaring
he knew he had never before entered the patio with that inspirited presence
now for some spunk
he said under his breath
plainly he meant his merry whistle and his buoyant step to interrupt this first languorous stage of the siesta which the girls always took during the hot hours
nell had acquired the habit long before mercedes came to show how fixed a thing it was in the life of the tropics
but neither girl heard him
mercedes lay under the palo verde her beautiful head dark and still upon a cushion
nell was asleep in the hammock
there was an abandonment in her deep repose and a faint smile upon her face
her sweet red lips with the soft perfect curve had always fascinated dick and now drew him irresistibly
he had always been consumed with a desire to kiss her and now he was overwhelmed with his opportunity
it would be a terrible thing to do but if she did not awaken at once  no he would fight the temptation
that would be more than spunk
it would  suddenly an ugly green fly sailed low over nell appeared about to alight on her
noiselessly dick stepped close to the hammock bent under the tree and with a sweep of his hand chased the intruding fly away
but he found himself powerless to straighten up
he was close to herbending over her facenear the sweet lips
the insolent dreaming smile just parted them
then he thought he was lost
but she stirredhe feared she would awaken
he had stepped back erect when she opened her eyes
they were sleepy yet surprised until she saw him
then she was wide awake in a second bewildered uncertain
whyyou here
she asked slowly
large as life
replied dick with unusual gayety
how long have you been here
just got here this fraction of a second he replied lying shamelessly
it was evident that she did not know whether or not to believe him and as she studied him a slow blush dyed her cheek
you are absolutely truthful when you say you just stepped there
why of course answered dick right glad he did not have to lie about that
i thoughti wasdreaming she said and evidently the sound of her voice reassured her
yes you looked as if you were having pleasant dreams replied dick
so sorry to wake you
i can't see how i came to do it i was so quiet
mercedes didn't wake
well i'll go and let you have your siesta and dreams
but he did not move to go
nell regarded him with curious speculative eyes
isn't it a lovely day
queried dick
i think it's hot
only ninety in the shade
and you've told me the mercury goes to one hundred and thirty in midsummer
this is just a glorious golden day
yesterday was finer but you didn't notice it
oh yesterday was somewhere back in the pastthe inconsequential past
nell's sleepy blue eyes opened a little wider
she did not know what to make of this changed young man
dick felt gleeful and tried hard to keep the fact from becoming manifest
what's the inconsequential past
you seem remarkably happy today
i certainly am happy
adios
pleasant dreams
dick turned away then and left the patio by the opening into the yard
nell was really sleepy and when she had fallen asleep again he would return
he walked around for a while
belding and the rangers were shoeing a broncho
yaqui was in the field with the horses
blanco sol grazed contently and now and then lifted his head to watch
his long ears went up at sight of his master and he whistled
presently dick as if magnetdrawn retraced his steps to the patio and entered noiselessly
nell was now deep in her siesta
she was inert relaxed untroubled by dreams
her hair was damp on her brow
again nell stirred and gradually awakened
her eyes unclosed humid shadowy unconscious
they rested upon dick for a moment before they became clear and comprehensive
he stood back fully ten feet from her and to all outside appearances regarded her calmly
i've interrupted your siesta again he said
please forgive me
i'll take myself off
he wandered away and when it became impossible for him to stay away any longer he returned to the patio
the instant his glance rested upon nell's face he divined she was feigning sleep
the faint roseblush had paled
the warm rich golden tint of her skin had fled
dick dropped upon his knees and bent over her
though his blood was churning in his veins his breast laboring his mind whirling with the wonder of that moment and its promise he made himself deliberate
he wanted more than anything he had ever wanted in his life to see if she would keep up that pretense of sleep and let him kiss her
she must have felt his breath for her hair waved off her brow
her cheeks were now white
her breast swelled and sank
he bent down closercloser
but he must have been maddeningly slow for as he bent still closer nell's eyes opened and he caught a swift purple gaze of eyes as she whirled her head
then with  a little cry she rose and fled
x  rojas  no word from george thorne had come to forlorn river in weeks
gale grew concerned over the fact and began to wonder if anything serious could have happened to him
mercedes showed a slow wearing strain
thorne's commission expired the end of january and if he could not get his discharge immediately he surely could obtain leave of absence
therefore gale waited not without growing anxiety and did his best to cheer mercedes
the first of february came bringing news of rebel activities and bandit operations in and around casita but not a word from the cavalryman
mercedes became silent mournful
her eyes were great black windows of tragedy
nell devoted herself entirely to the unfortunate girl dick exerted himself to persuade her that all would yet come well in fact the whole household could not have been kinder to a sister or a daughter
but their united efforts were unavailing
mercedes seemed to accept with fatalistic hopelessness a last and crowning misfortune
a dozen times gale declared he would ride in to casita and find out why they did not hear from thorne however older and wiser heads prevailed over his impetuosity
belding was not sanguine over the safety of the casita trail
refugees from there arrived every day in forlorn river and if tales they told were true real war would have been preferable to what was going on along the border
belding and the rangers and the yaqui held a consultation
not only had the indian become a faithful servant to gale but he was also of value to belding
yaqui had all the craft of his class and superior intelligence
his knowledge of mexicans was second only to his hate of them
and yaqui who had been scouting on all the trails gave information that made belding decide to wait some days before sending any one to casita
he required promises from his rangers particularly gale not to leave without his consent
it was upon gale's coming from this conference that he encountered nell
since the interrupted siesta episode she had been more than ordinarily elusive and about all he had received from her was a tantalizing smile from a distance
he got the impression now however that she had awaited him
when he drew close to her he was certain of it and he experienced more than surprise
dick she began hurriedly
dad's not going to send any one to see about thorne
no not yet
he thinks it best not to
we all think so
i'm sorry
poor mercedes
i knew it
i tried to coax him to send laddy or even yaqui
he wouldn't listen to me
dick mercedes is dying by inches
can't you see what ails her
it's more than love or fear
it's uncertaintysuspense
oh can't we find out for her
nell i feel as badly as you about her
i wanted to ride in to casita
belding shut me up quick the last time
nell came close to gale clasped his arm
there was no color in her face
her eyes held a dark eager excitement
dick will you slip off without dad's consent
risk it
go to casita and find out what's happened to thorneat least if he ever started for forlorn river
no nell i won't do that
she drew away from him with passionate suddenness
are you afraid
this certainly was not the nell burton that gale knew
no i'm not afraid gale replied a little nettled
will you gofor my sake
like lightning her mood changed and she was close to him again hands on his her face white her whole presence sweetly alluring
nell i won't disobey belding protested gale
i won't break my word
dick it'll not be so bad as that
butwhat if it is
go dick if not for poor mercedes's sake then for mineto please me
i'lli'll you won't lose anything by going
i think i know how mercedes feels
just a word from thorne or about him would save her
take blanco sol and go dick
what rebel outfit could ever ride you down on that horse
why dick if i was up on sol i wouldn't be afraid of the whole rebel army
my dear girl it's not a question of being afraid
it's my wordmy duty to belding
you said you loved me
if you love me you will go you don't love me
gale could only stare at this transformed girl
dick listen
if you goif you fetch some word of thorne to comfort mercedes youwell you will have your reward
nell
her dangerous sweetness was as amazing as this newly revealed character
dick will you go
nono
cried gale in violence struggling with himself
nell burton i'll tell you this
to have the reward i want would mean pretty near heaven for me
but not even for that will i break my word to your father
she seemed the incarnation of girlish scorn and wilful passion
gracias senor she replied mockingly
adios
then she flashed out of his sight
gale went to his room at once disturbed and thrilling and did not soon recover from that encounter
the following morning at the breakfast table nell was not present
mrs belding evidently considered the fact somewhat unusual for she called out into the patio and then into the yard
then she went to mercedes's room
but nell was not there either
she's in one of her tantrums lately said belding
wouldn't speak to me this morning
let her alone mother
she's spoiled enough without running after her
she's always hungry
she'll be on hand presently don't mistake me
notwithstanding belding's conviction which gale shared nell did not appear at all during the hour
when belding and the rangers went outside yaqui was eating his meal on the bench where he always sat
yaquilluvia d' oro si
asked belding waving his hand toward the corrals
the indian's beautiful name for nell meant shower of gold and belding used it in asking yaqui if he had seen her
he received a negative reply
perhaps half an hour afterward as gale was leaving his room he saw the yaqui running up the path from the fields
it was markedly out of the ordinary to see the indian run
gale wondered what was the matter
yaqui ran straight to belding who was at work at his bench under the wagon shed
in less than a moment belding was bellowing for his rangers
gale got to him first but ladd and lash were not far behind
blanco sol gone
yelled belding in a rage
gone
in broad daylight with the indian awatchin
queried ladd
it happened while yaqui was at breakfast
that's sure
he'd just watered sol
raiders
exclaimed jim lash
lord only knows
yaqui says it wasn't raiders
mebbe sol's just walked off somewheres
he was haltered in the corral
send yaqui to find the hoss's trail an' let's figger said ladd
shore this 's no raider job
in the swift search that ensued gale did not have anything to say but his mind was forming a conclusion
when he found his old saddle and bridle missing from the peg in the barn his conclusion became a positive conviction and it made him for the moment cold and sick and speechless
hey dick don't take it so much to heart said belding
we'll likely find sol and if we don't there's other good horses
i'm not thinking of sol replied gale
ladd cast a sharp glance at gale snapped his fingers and said  damn me if i ain't guessed it too
what's wrong with you locoed gents
bluntly demanded belding
nell has slipped away on sol answered dick
there was a blank pause which presently belding broke
well that's all right if nell's on him
i was afraid we'd lost the horse
belding you're trackin' bad said ladd wagging his head
nell has started for casita burst out gale
she has gone to fetch mercedes some word about thorne
oh belding you needn't shake your head
i know she's gone
she tried to persuade me to go and was furious when i wouldn't
i don't believe it replied belding hoarsely
nell may have her temper
she's a little devil at times but she always had good sense
tom you can gamble she's gone said ladd
aw hell no
jim what do you think
implored belding
i reckon sol's white head is pointed level an' straight down the casita trail
an' nell can ride
we're losing' time
that roused belding to action
i say you're all wrong he yelled starting for the corrals
she's only taking a little ride same as she's done often
but rustle now
find out
dick you ride cross the valley
jim you hunt up and down the river
i'll head up san felipe way
and you laddy take diablo and hit the casita trail
if she really has gone after thorne you can catch her in an hour or so
shore i'll go replied ladd
but beldin' if you're not plumb crazy you're close to it
that big white devil can't catch sol
not in an hour or a day or a week
what's more at the end of any runnin' time with an even start sol will be farther in the lead
an' now sol's got an hour's start
laddy you mean to say sol is a faster horse than diablo
thundered belding his face purple
shore
i mean to tell you just that there replied the ranger
i'lli'll bet a  we're wastin' time curtly interrupted ladd
you can gamble on this if you want to
i'll ride your blanco devil as he never was rid before 'cept once when a damn sight better hossman than i am couldn't make him outrun sol
without more words the men saddled and were off not waiting for the yaqui to come in with possible information as to what trail blanco sol had taken
it certainly did not show in the clear sand of the level valley where gale rode to and fro
when gale returned to the house he found belding and lash awaiting him
they did not mention their own search but stated that yaqui had found blanco sol's tracks in the casita trail
after some consultation belding decided to send lash along after ladd
the interminable time that followed contained for gale about as much suspense as he could well bear
what astonished him and helped him greatly to fight off actual distress was the endurance of nell's mother
early on the morning of the second day gale who had acquired an unbreakable habit of watching saw three white horses and a bay come wearily stepping down the road
he heard blanco sol's familiar whistle and he leaped up wild with joy
the horse was riderless
gale's sudden joy received a violent check then resurged when he saw a limp white form in jim lash's arms
ladd was supporting a horseman who wore a military uniform
gale shouted with joy and ran into the house to tell the good news
it was the everthoughtful mrs belding who prevented him from rushing in to tell mercedes
then he hurried out into the yard closely followed by the beldings
lash handed down a ragged travelstained wan girl into belding's arms
dad
mama
it was indeed a repentant nell but there was spirit yet in the tired blue eyes
then she caught sight of gale and gave him a faint smile
hellodick
nell
gale reached for her hand held it tightly and found speech difficult
you needn't worryabout your old horse she said as belding carried her toward the door
oh dick
blanco sol isglorious
gale turned to greet his friend
indeed it was but a haggard ghost of the cavalryman
thorne looked ill or wounded
gale's greeting was also a question full of fear
thorne's answer was a faint smile
he seemed ready to drop from the saddle
gale helped ladd hold thorne upon the horse until they reached the house
belding came out again
his welcome was checked as he saw the condition of the cavalryman
thorne reeled into dick's arms
but he was able to stand and walk
i'm nothurt
only weakstarved he said
is mercedes  take me to her
she'll be well the minute she sees him averred belding as he and gale led the cavalryman to mercedes's room
there they left him and gale at least felt his ears ringing with the girl's broken cry of joy
when belding and gale hurried forth again the rangers were tending the tired horses
upon returning to the house jim lash calmly lit his pipe and ladd declared that hungry as he was he had to tell his story
shore beldin' began ladd that was funny about diablo catchin' blanco sol
funny ain't the word
i nearly laughed myself to death
well i rode in sol's tracks all the way to casita
never seen a rebel or a raider till i got to town
figgered nell made the trip in five hours
i went straight to the camp of the cavalrymen an' found them just coolin' off an' dressin' down their hosses after what looked to me like a big ride
i got there too late for the fireworks
some soldier took me to an officer's tent
nell was there some white an' all in
she just said 'laddy'
thorne was there too an' he was bein' worked over by the camp doctor
i didn't ask no questions because i seen quiet was needed round that tent
after satisfying myself that nell was all right an' thorne in no danger i went out
shore there was so darn many fellers who wanted to an' tried to tell me what'd come off i thought i'd never find out
but i got the story piece by piece
an' here's what happened
nell rode blanco sol atearin' into camp an' had a crowd round her in a jiffy
she told who she was where she'd come from an' what she wanted
well it seemed a day or so before nell got there the cavalrymen had heard word of thorne
you see thorne had left camp on leave of absence some time before
he was shore mysterious they said an' told nobody where he was goin'
a week or so after he left camp some greaser give it away that rojas had a prisoner in a dobe shack near his camp
nobody paid much attention to what the greaser said
he wanted money for mescal
an' it was usual for rojas to have prisoners
but in a few more days it turned out pretty sure that for some reason rojas was holdin' thorne
now it happened when this news came colonel weede was in nogales with his staff an' the officer left in charge didn't know how to proceed
rojas's camp was across the line in mexico an' ridin' over there was serious business
it meant a whole lot more than just scatterin' one greaser camp
it was what had been botherin' more'n one colonel along the line
thorne's feller soldiers was anxious to get him out of a bad fix but they had to wait for orders
when nell found out thorne was bein' starved an' beat in a dobe shack no more'n two mile across the line she shore stirred up that cavalry camp
shore
she told them soldiers rojas was holdin' thornetorturin' him to make him tell where mercedes was
she told about mercedeshow sweet an' beautiful she washow her father had been murdered by rojashow she had been hounded by the bandithow ill an' miserable she was waitin' for her lover
an' she begged the cavalrymen to rescue thorne
from the way it was told to me i reckon them cavalrymen went up in the air
fine fiery lot of young bloods i thought achin' for a scrap
but the officer in charge bein' in a ticklish place still held out for higher orders
then nell broke loose
youall know nell's tongue is sometimes like a choya thorn
i'd have give somethin' to see her work up that soldier outfit
nell's never so pretty as when she's mad
an' this last stunt of hers was no girly tantrum as beldin' calls it
she musta been ragin' with all the hell there's in a woman can't you fellers see her on blanco sol with her eyes turnin' black
ladd mopped his sweaty face with his dusty scarf
he was beaming
he was growing excited hurried in his narrative
right out then nell swore she'd go after thorne
if them cavalrymen couldn't ride with a western girl to save a brother americanlet them hang back
one feller under orders tried to stop blanco sol
an' that feller invited himself to the hospital
then the cavalrymen went flyin' for their hosses
mebbe nell's move was just foxywoman's cunnin'
but i'm thinkin' as she felt then she'd have sent blanco sol straight into rojas's camp which i'd forgot to say was in plain sight
it didn't take long for every cavalryman in that camp to get wind of what was comin' off
shore they musta been wild
they strung out after nell in a thunderin' troop
say i wish you fellers could see the lane that bunch of hosses left in the greasewood an' cactus
looks like there'd been a cattle stampede on the desert blanco sol stayed out in front you can gamble on that
right into rojas's camp
sabe you senors
gawd almighty
i never had grief that 'd hold a candle to this one of bein' too late to see nell an' sol in their one best race
rojas an' his men vamoosed without a shot
that ain't surprisin'
there wasn't a shot fired by anybody
the cavalrymen soon found thorne an' hurried with him back on uncle sam's land
thorne was half naked black an' blue all over thin as a rail
he looked mighty sick when i seen him first
that was a little after midday
he was given food an' drink
shore he seemed a starved man
but he picked up wonderful an' by the time jim came along he was wantin' to start for forlorn river
so was nell
by main strength as much as persuasion we kept the two of them quiet till next evenin' at dark
well we made as sneaky a start in the dark as jim an' me could manage an' never hit the trail till we was miles from town
thorne's nerve held him up for a while
then all at once he tumbled out of his saddle
we got him back an' lash held him on
nell didn't give out till daybreak
as ladd paused in his story belding began to stutter and finally he exploded
his mighty utterances were incoherent
but plainly the wrath he had felt toward the wilful girl was forgotten
gale remained gripped by silence
i reckon you'll all be some surprised when you see casita went on ladd
it's half burned an' half tore down
an' the rebels are livin' fat
there was rumors of another federal force on the road from casa grandes
i seen a good many americans from interior mexico an' the stories they told would make your hair stand up
they all packed guns was fightin' mad at greasers an' sore on the good old u s  but shore glad to get over the line
some were waitin' for trains which don't run reg'lar no more an' others were ready to hit the trails north
laddy what knocks me is rojas holding thorne prisoner trying to make him tell where mercedes had been hidden said belding
shore
it 'd knock anybody
the bandit's crazy over her
that's the spanish of it replied belding his voice rolling
rojas is a peon
he's been a slave to the proud castilian
he loves mercedes as he hates her
when i was down in durango i saw something of these peons' insane passions
rojas wants this girl only to have her then kill her
it's damn strange boys and even with thorne here our troubles have just begun
tom you spoke correct said jim ladd in his cool drawl
shore i'm not sayin' what i think added ladd
but the look of him was not indicative of a tranquil optimism
thorne was put to bed in gale's room
he was very weak yet he would keep mercedes's hand and gaze at her with unbelieving eyes
mercedes's failing hold on hope and strength seemed to have been a fantasy she was again vivid magnetic beautiful shot through and through with intense and throbbing life
she induced him to take food and drink
then fighting sleep with what little strength he had left at last he succumbed
for all dick could ascertain his friend never stirred an eyelash nor a finger for twentyseven hours
when he awoke he was pale weak but the old thorne
hello dick i didn't dream it then he said
there you are and my darling with the proud dark eyesshe's here
why yes you locoed cavalryman
say what's happened to you
it can't be those clothes and a little bronze on your face dick you're olderyou've changed
you're not so thickly built
by gad if you don't look fine
thanks
i'm sorry i can't return the compliment
you're about the seediest hungriestlooking fellow i ever saw say old man you must have had a tough time
a dark and somber fire burned out the happiness in thorne's eyes
dick don't make medon't let me think of that fiend rojas
i'm here now
i'll be well in a day or two
then
mercedes came in radiant and softvoiced
she fell upon her knees beside thorne's bed and neither of them appeared to see nell enter with a tray
then gale and nell made a good deal of unnecessary bustle in moving a small table close to the bed
mercedes had forgotten for the moment that her lover had been a starving man
if thorne remembered it he did not care
they held hands and looked at each other without speaking
nell i thought i had it bad whispered dick
but i'm not  hush
it's beautiful replied nell softly and she tried to coax dick from the room
dick however thought he ought to remain at least long enough to tell thorne that a man in his condition could not exist solely upon love
mercedes sprang up blushing with pretty penitent manner and moving white hands eloquent of her condition
oh mercedesdon't go
cried thorne as she stepped to the door
senor dick will stay
he is not mucha malo for youas i am
then she smiled and went out
good lord
exclaimed thorne
how i love her
dick isn't she the most beautiful the loveliest the finest  george i share your enthusiasm said dick dryly but mercedes isn't the only girl on earth
manifestly this was a startling piece of information and struck thorne in more than one way
george went on dick did you happen to observe the girl who saved your lifewho incidentally just fetched in your breakfast
nell burton
why of course
she's brave a wonderful girl and really nicelooking
you long lean hungry beggar
that was the young lady who might answer the raving eulogy you just got out of your system
iwell you haven't cornered the love market
thorne uttered some kind of a sound that his weakened condition would not allow to be a whoop
dick
do you mean it
i shore do as laddy says
i'm glad dick with all my heart
i wondered at the changed look you wear
why boy you've got a different front
call the lady in and you bet i'll look her over right
i can see better now
eat your breakfast
there's plenty of time to dazzle you afterward
thorne fell to upon his breakfast and made it vanish with magic speed
meanwhile dick told him something of a ranger's life along the border
you needn't waste your breath said thorne
i guess i can see
belding and those rangers have made you the real thingthe real western goods what i want to know is all about the girl
well laddy swears she's got your girl roped in the corral for looks
that's not possible
i'll have to talk to laddy
but she must be a wonder or dick gale would never have fallen for her
isn't it great dick
i'm here
mercedes is wellsafe
you've got a girl
oh
but say i haven't a dollar to my name
i had a lot of money dick and those robbers stole it my watcheverything
damn that little black greaser
he got mercedes's letters
i wish you could have seen him trying to read them
he's simply nutty over her dick
i could have borne the loss of money and valuablesbut those beautiful wonderful lettersthey're gone
cheer up
you have the girl
belding will make you a proposition presently
the future smiles old friend
if this rebel business was only ended
dick you're going to be my savior twice over well now listen to me
his gay excitement changed to earnest gravity
i want to marry mercedes at once
is there a padre here
yes
but are you wise in letting any mexican even a priest know mercedes is hidden in forlorn river
it couldn't be kept much longer
gale was compelled to acknowledge the truth of this statement
i'll marry her first then i'll face my problem
fetch the padre dick
and ask our kind friends to be witnesses at the ceremony
much to gale's surprise neither belding nor ladd objected to the idea of bringing a padre into the household and thereby making known to at least one mexican the whereabouts of mercedes castaneda
belding's caution was wearing out in wrath at the persistent unsettled condition of the border and ladd grew only the cooler and more silent as possibilities of trouble multiplied
gale fetched the padre a little weazened timid man who was old and without interest or penetration
apparently he married mercedes and thorne as he told his beads or mumbled a prayer
it was mrs belding who kept the occasion from being a merry one and she insisted on not exciting thorne
gale marked her unusual pallor and the singular depth and sweetness of her voice
mother what's the use of making a funeral out of a marriage
protested belding
a chance for some fun doesn't often come to forlorn river
you're a fine doctor
can't you see the girl is what thorne needed
he'll be well tomorrow don't mistake me
george when you're all right again we'll add something to present congratulations said gale
we shore will put in ladd
so with parting jests and smiles they left the couple to themselves
belding enjoyed a laugh at his good wife's expense for thorne could not be kept in bed and all in a day it seemed he grew so well and so hungry that his friends were delighted and mercedes was radiant
in a few days his weakness disappeared and he was going the round of the fields and looking over the ground marked out in gale's plan of water development
thorne was highly enthusiastic and at once staked out his claim for one hundred and sixty acres of land adjoining that of belding and the rangers
these five tracts took in all the ground necessary for their operations but in case of the success of the irrigation project the idea was to increase their squatter holdings by purchase of more land down the valley
a hundred families had lately moved to forlorn river more were coming all the time and belding vowed he could see a vision of the whole altar valley green with farms
meanwhile everybody in belding's household except the quiet ladd and the watchful yaqui in the absence of disturbance of any kind along the border grew freer and more unrestrained as if anxiety was slowly fading in the peace of the present
jim lash made a trip to the sonoyta oasis and ladd patrolled fifty miles of the line eastward without incident or sight of raiders
evidently all the border hawks were in at the picking of casita
the february nights were cold with a dry icy penetrating coldness that made a warm fire most comfortable
belding's household usually congregated in the sittingroom where burning mesquite logs crackled in the open fireplace
belding's one passion besides horses was the game of checkers and he was always wanting to play
on this night he sat playing with ladd who never won a game and never could give up trying
mrs belding worked with her needle stopping from time to time to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the fire
jim lash smoked his pipe by the hearth and played with the cat on his knee
thorne and mercedes were at the table with pencil and paper and he was trying his best to keep his attention from his wife's beautiful animated face long enough to read and write a little spanish
gale and nell sat in a corner watching the bright fire
there came a low knock on the door
it may have been an ordinary knock for it did not disturb the women but to belding and his rangers it had a subtle meaning
who's that
asked belding as he slowly pushed back his chair and looked at ladd
yaqui replied the ranger
come in called belding
the door opened and the short square powerfully built indian entered
he had a magnificent head strangely staring somber black eyes and very darkly bronzed face
he carried a rifle and strode with impressive dignity
yaqui what do you want
asked belding and repeated his question in spanish
senor dick replied the indian
gale jumped up stifling an exclamation and he went outdoors with yaqui
he felt his arm gripped and allowed himself to be led away without asking a question
yaqui's presence was always one of gloom and now his stern action boded catastrophe
once clear of trees he pointed to the level desert across the river where a row of campfires shone bright out of the darkness
raiders
ejaculated gale
then he cautioned yaqui to keep sharp lookout and hurriedly returning to the house he called the men out and told them there were rebels or raiders camping just across the line
ladd did not say a word
belding with an oath slammed down his cigar
i knew it was too good to last dick you and jim stay here while laddy and i look around
dick returned to the sittingroom
the women were nervous and not to be deceived
so dick merely said yaqui had sighted some lights off in the desert and they probably were campfires
belding did not soon return and when he did he was alone and saying he wanted to consult with the men he sent mrs belding and the girls to their rooms
his gloomy anxiety had returned
laddy's gone over to scout around and try to find out who the outfit belongs to and how many are in it said belding
i reckon if they're raiders with bad intentions we wouldn't see no fires remarked jim calmly
it 'd be useless i suppose to send for the cavalry said gale
whatever's coming off would be over before the soldiers could be notified let alone reach here
hell fellows
i don't look for an attack on forlorn river burst out belding
i can't believe that possible
these rebelraiders have a little sense
they wouldn't spoil their game by pulling u s soldiers across the line from yuma to el paso
but as jim says if they wanted to steal a few horses or cattle they wouldn't build fires
i'm afraid it's  belding hesitated and looked with grim concern at the cavalryman
what
queried thorne
i'm afraid it's rojas
thorne turned pale but did not lose his nerve
i thought of that at once
if true it'll be terrible for mercedes and me
but rojas will never get his hands on my wife
if i can't kill him i'll kill her
belding this is tough on youthis risk we put upon your family
i regret  cut that kind of talk replied belding bluntly
well if it is rojas he's acting damn strange for a raider
that's what worries me
we can't do anything but wait
with laddy and yaqui out there we won't be surprised
let's take the best possible view of the situation until we know more
that'll not likely be before tomorrow
the women of the house might have gotten some sleep that night but it was certain the men did not get any
morning broke cold and gray the th of february
breakfast was prepared earlier than usual and an air of suppressed waiting excitement pervaded the place
otherwise the ordinary details of the morning's work continued as on any other day
ladd came in hungry and cold and said the mexicans were not breaking camp
he reported a goodsized force of rebels and was taciturn as to his idea of forthcoming events
about an hour after sunrise yaqui ran in with the information that part of the rebels were crossing the river
that can't mean a fight yet declared belding
but get in the house boys and make ready anyway
i'll meet them
drive them off the place same as if you had a company of soldiers backin' you said ladd
don't give them an inch
we're in bad and the bigger bluff we put up the more likely our chance
belding you're an officer of the united states
mexicans are much impressed by show of authority
i've seen that often in camp said thorne
oh i know the whitelivered greasers better than any of you don't mistake me replied belding
he was pale with rage but kept command over himself
the rangers with yaqui and thorne stationed themselves at the several windows of the sittingroom
rifles and smaller arms and boxes of shells littered the tables and window seats
no small force of besiegers could overcome a resistance such as belding and his men were capable of making
here they come boys called gale from his window
rebelraiders i should say laddy
shore
an' a fine outfit of buzzards
reckon there's about a dozen in the bunch observed the calm lash
some hosses they're ridin'
where 'n the hell do they get such hosses anyhow
shore jim they work hard an' buy 'em with real silver pesos replied ladd sarcastically
do any of you see rojas
whispered thorne
nix
no dandy bandit in that outfit
it's too far to see said gale
the horsemen halted at the corrals
they were orderly and showed no evidence of hostility
they were however fully armed
belding stalked out to meet them
apparently a leader wanted to parley with him but belding would hear nothing
he shook his head waved his arms stamped to and fro and his loud angry voice could be heard clear back at the house
whereupon the detachment of rebels retired to the bank of the river beyond the white post that marked the boundary line and there they once more drew rein
belding remained by the corrals watching them evidently still in threatening mood
presently a single rider left the troop and trotted his horse back down the road
when he reached the corrals he was seen to halt and pass something to belding
then he galloped away to join his comrades
belding looked at whatever it was he held in his hand shook his burley head and started swiftly for the house
he came striding into the room holding a piece of soiled paper
can't read it and don't know as i want to he said savagely
beldin' shore we'd better read it replied ladd
what we want is a line on them greasers
whether they're campo's men or salazar's or just a wanderin' bunch of rebelsor rojas's bandits
sabe senor
not one of the men was able to translate the garbled scrawl
shore mercedes can read it said ladd
thorne opened a door and called her
she came into the room followed by nell and mrs belding
evidently all three divined a critical situation
my dear we want you to read what's written on this paper said thorne as he led her to the table
it was sent in by rebels andand we fear contains bad news for us
mercedes gave the writing one swift glance then fainted in thorne's arms
he carried her to a couch and with nell and mrs belding began to work over her
belding looked at his rangers
it was characteristic of the man that now when catastrophe appeared inevitable all the gloom and care and angry agitation passed from him
laddy it's rojas all right
how many men has he out there
mebbe twenty
not more
we can lick twice that many greasers
shore
jim lash removed his pipe long enough to speak
i reckon
but it ain't sense to start a fight when mebbe we can avoid it
what's your idea
let's stave the greaser off till dark
then laddy an' me an' thorne will take mercedes an' hit the trail for yuma
camino del diablo
that awful trail with a woman
jim do you forget how many hundreds of men have perished on the devil's road
i reckon i ain't forgettin' nothin' replied jim
the waterholes are full now
there's grass an' we can do the job in six days
it's three hundred miles to yuma
beldin' jim's idea hits me pretty reasonable interposed ladd
lord knows that's about the only chance we've got except fightin'
but suppose we do stave rojas off and you get safely away with mercedes
isn't rojas going to find it out quick
then what'll he try to do to us who're left here
i reckon he'd find out by daylight replied jim
but tom he ain't agoin' to start a scrap then
he'd want time an' hosses an' men to chase us out on the trail
you see i'm figgerin' on the crazy greaser wantin' the girl
i reckon he'll try to clean up here to get her
but he's too smart to fight you for nothin'
rojas may be nutty about women but he's afraid of the u s take my word for it he'd discover the trail in the mornin' an' light out on it
i reckon with ten hours' start we could travel comfortable
belding paced up and down the room
jim and ladd whispered together
gale walked to the window and looked out at the distant group of bandits and then turned his gaze to rest upon mercedes
she was conscious now and her eyes seemed all the larger and blacker for the whiteness of her face
thorne held her hands and the other women were trying to still her tremblings
no one but gale saw the yaqui in the background looking down upon the spanish girl
all of yaqui's looks were strange but this singularly so
gale marked it and felt he would never forget
mercedes's beauty had never before struck him as being so exquisite so alluring as now when she lay stricken
gale wondered if the indian was affected by her loveliness her helplessness or her terror
yaqui had seen mercedes only a few times and upon each of these he had appeared to be fascinated
could the strange indian because his hate for mexicans was so great be gloating over her misery
something about yaquia noble austerity of countenancemade gale feel his suspicion unjust
presently belding called his rangers to him and then thorne
listen to this he said earnestly
i'll go out and have a talk with rojas
i'll try to reason with him tell him to think a long time before he sheds blood on uncle sam's soil
that he's now after an american's wife
i'll not commit myself nor will i refuse outright to consider his demands nor will i show the least fear of him
i'll play for time
if my bluff goes through well and good after dark the four of you laddy jim dick and thorne will take mercedes and my best white horses and with yaqui as guide circle round through altar valley to the trail and head for yuma
wait now laddy
let me finish
i want you to take the white horses for two reasonsto save them and to save you
savvy
if rojas should follow on my horses he'd be likely to catch you
also you can pack a great deal more than on the bronchs
also the big horses can travel faster and farther on little grass and water
i want you to take the indian because in a case of this kind he'll be a godsend
if you get headed or lost or have to circle off the trail think what it 'd mean to have yaqui with you
he knows sonora as no greaser knows it
he could hide you find water and grass when you would absolutely believe it impossible
the indian is loyal
he has his debt to pay and he'll pay it don't mistake me
when you're gone i'll hide nell so rojas won't see her if he searches the place
then i think i could sit down and wait without any particular worry
the rangers approved of belding's plan and thorne choked in his effort to express his gratitude
all right we'll chance it concluded belding
i'll go out now and call rojas and his outfit over say it might be as well for me to know just what he said in that paper
thorne went to the side of his wife
mercedes we've planned to outwit rojas
will you tell us just what he wrote
the girl sat up her eyes dilating and with her hands clasping thorne's
she said  rojas sworeby his saints and his virginthat if i wasn't givento himin twentyfour hourshe would set fire to the villagekill the mencarry off the womenhang the children on cactus thorns
a moment's silence followed her last halting whisper
by his saints an' his virgin
echoed ladd
he laugheda cold cutting deadly laughsignificant and terrible
then the yaqui uttered a singular cry
gale had heard this once before and now he remembered it was at the papago well
look at the indian whispered belding hoarsely
damn if i don't believe he understood every word mercedes said
and gentlemen don't mistake me if he ever gets near senor rojas there'll be some gory aztec knife work
yaqui had moved close to mercedes and stood beside her as she leaned against her husband
she seemed impelled to meet the indian's gaze and evidently it was so powerful or hypnotic that it wrought irresistibly upon her
but she must have seen or divined what was beyond the others for she offered him her trembling hand
yaqui took it and laid it against his body in a strange motion and bowed his head
then he stepped back into the shadow of the room
belding went outdoors while the rangers took up their former position at the west window
each had his own somber thoughts gale imagined and knew his own were dark enough
a slow fire crept along his veins
he saw belding halt at the corrals and wave his hand
then the rebels mounted and came briskly up the road this time to rein in abreast
wherever rojas had kept himself upon the former advance was not clear but he certainly was prominently in sight now
he made a gaudy almost a dashing figure
gale did not recognize the white sombrero the crimson scarf the velvet jacket nor any feature of the dandy's costume but their general effect the whole ensemble recalled vividly to mind his first sight of the bandit
rojas dismounted and seemed to be listening
he betrayed none of the excitement gale had seen in him that night at the del sol
evidently this composure struck ladd and lash as unusual in a mexican supposed to be laboring under stress of feeling
belding made gestures vehemently bobbed his big head appeared to talk with his body as much as with his tongue
then rojas was seen to reply and after that it was clear that the talk became painful and difficult
it ended finally in what appeared to be mutual understanding
rojas mounted and rode away with his men while belding came tramping back to the house
as he entered the door his eyes were shining his big hands were clenched and he was breathing audibly
you can rope me if i'm not locoed
he burst out
i went out to conciliate a redhanded little murderer and damn me if i didn't meet aawell i've not suitable name handy
i started my bluff and got along pretty well but i forgot to mention that mercedes was thorne's wife
and what do you think
rojas swore he loved mercedesswore he'd marry her right here in forlorn riverswore he would give up robbing and killing people and take her away from mexico
he has goldjewels
he swore if he didn't get her nothing mattered
he'd die anyway without her and here's the strange thing
i believe him
he was cold as ice and all hell inside
never saw a greaser like him
well i pretended to be greatly impressed
we got to talking friendly i suppose though i didn't understand half he said and i imagine he gathered less what i said
anyway without my asking he said for me to think it over for a day and then we'd talk again
shore we're born lucky
ejaculated ladd
i reckon rojas'll be smart enough to string his outfit across the few trails leadin' out of forlorn river remarked jim
that needn't worry us
all we want is dark to come replied belding
yaqui will slip through
if we thank any lucky stars let it be for the indian now boys put on your thinking caps
you'll take eight horses the pick of my bunch
you must pack all that's needed for a possible long trip
mind yaqui may lead you down into some wild sonora valley and give rojas the slip
you may get to yuma in six days and maybe in six weeks
yet you've got to pack lighta small pack in saddleslarger ones on the two free horses
you may have a big fight
laddy take the 
dick will pack his remington
all of you go gunned heavy
but the main thing is a pack that 'll be light enough for swift travel yet one that 'll keep you from starving on the desert
the rest of that day passed swiftly
dick had scarcely a word with nell and all the time as he chose and deliberated and worked over his little pack there was a dull pain in his heart
the sun set twilight fell then night closed down fortunately a night slightly overcast
gale saw the white horses pass his door like silent ghosts
even blanco diablo made no sound and that fact was indeed a tribute to the yaqui
gale went out to put his saddle on blanco sol
the horse rubbed a soft nose against his shoulder
then gale returned to the sittingroom
there was nothing more to do but wait and say goodby
mercedes came clad in leather chaps and coat a slim stripling of a cowboy her dark eyes flashing
her beauty could not be hidden and now hope and courage had fired her blood
gale drew nell off into the shadow of the room
she was trembling and as she leaned toward him she was very different from the coy girl who had so long held him aloof
he took her into his arms
dearest i'm goingsoon and maybe i'll never  dick dodon't say it sobbed nell with her head on his breast
i might never come back he went on steadily
i love youi've loved you ever since the first moment i saw you
do you care for mea little
dear dickdedear dick my heart is breaking faltered nell as she clung to him
it might be breaking for mercedesfor laddy and jim
i want to hear something for myself
something to have on long marchesround lonely campfires
something to keep my spirit alive
oh nell you can't imagine that silence out therethat terrible world of sand and stone
do you love me
yes yes
oh i love you so
i never knew it till now
i love you so
dick i'll be safe and i'll waitand hope and pray for your return
if i come backnowhen i come back will you marry me
iioh yes
she whispered and returned his kiss
belding was in the room speaking softly
nell darling i must go said dick
i'm a selfish little coward cried nell
it's so splendid of you all
i ought to glory in it but i can't
 fight if you must dick
fight for that lovely persecuted girl
i'll love youthe more oh
goodby
goodby
with a wrench that shook him gale let her go
he heard belding's soft voice
yaqui says the early hour's best
trust him laddy
remember what i sayyaqui's a godsend
then they were all outside in the pale gloom under the trees
yaqui mounted blanco diablo mercedes was lifted upon white woman thorne climbed astride queen jim lash was already upon his horse which was as white as the others but bore no name ladd mounted the stallion blanco torres and gathered up the long halters of the two pack horses gale came last with blanco sol
as he toed the stirrup hand on mane and pommel gale took one more look in at the door
nell stood in the gleam of light her hair shining face like ashes her eyes dark her lips parted her arms outstretched
that sweet and tragic picture etched its cruel outlines into gale's heart
he waved his hand and then fiercely leaped into the saddle
blanco sol stepped out
before gale stretched a line of moving horses white against dark shadows
he could not see the head of that column he scarcely heard a soft hoofbeat
a single star shone out of a rift in thin clouds
there was no wind
the air was cold
the dark space of desert seemed to yawn
to the left across the river flickered a few campfires
the chill night silent and mystical seemed to close in upon gale and he faced the wide quivering black level with keen eyes and grim intent and an awakening of that wild rapture which came like a spell to him in the open desert
xi  across cactus and lava  blanco sol showed no inclination to bend his head to the alfalfa which swished softly about his legs
gale felt the horse's sensitive almost human alertness
sol knew as well as his master the nature of that flight
at the far corner of the field yaqui halted and slowly the line of white horses merged into a compact mass
there was a trail here leading down to the river
the campfires were so close that the bright blazes could be seen in movement and dark forms crossed in front of them
yaqui slipped out of his saddle
he ran his hand over diablo's nose and spoke low and repeated this action for each of the other horses
gale had long ceased to question the strange indian's behavior
there was no explaining or understanding many of his manoeuvers
but the results of them were always thoughtprovoking
gale had never seen horse stand so silently as in this instance no stampno champ of bitno toss of headno shake of saddle or packno heave or snort
it seemed they had become imbued with the spirit of the indian
yaqui moved away into the shadows as noiselessly as if he were one of them
the darkness swallowed him
he had taken a parallel with the trail
gale wondered if yaqui meant to try to lead his string of horses by the rebel sentinels
ladd had his head bent low his ear toward the trail
jim's long neck had the arch of a listening deer
gale listened too and as the slow silent moments went by his faculty of hearing grew more acute from strain
he heard blanco sol breathe he heard the pound of his own heart he heard the silken rustle of the alfalfa he heard a faint faroff sound of voice like a lost echo
then his ear seemed to register a movement of air a disturbance so soft as to be nameless
then followed long silent moments
yaqui appeared as he had vanished
he might have been part of the shadows
but he was there
he started off down the trail leading diablo
again the white line stretched slowly out
gale fell in behind
a bench of ground covered with sparse greasewood sloped gently down to the deep wide arroyo of forlorn river
blanco sol shied a few feet out of the trail
peering low with keen eyes gale made out three objectsa white sombrero a blanket and a mexican lying face down
the yaqui had stolen upon this sentinel like a silent wind of death
just then a desert coyote wailed and the wild cry fitted the darkness and the yaqui's deed
once under the dark lee of the river bank yaqui caused another halt and he disappeared as before
it seemed to gale that the indian started to cross the pale level sandbed of the river where stones stood out gray and the darker line of opposite shore was visible
but he vanished and it was impossible to tell whether he went one way or another
moments passed
the horses held heads up looked toward the glimmering campfires and listened
gale thrilled with the meaning of it allthe nightthe silencethe flightand the wonderful indian stealing with the slow inevitableness of doom upon another sentinel
an hour passed and gale seemed to have become deadened to all sense of hearing
there were no more sounds in the world
the desert was as silent as it was black
yet again came that strange change in the tensity of gale's earstrain a check a break a vibrationand this time the sound did not go nameless
it might have been moan of wind or wail of fardistant wolf but gale imagined it was the strangling deathcry of another guard or that strange involuntary utterance of the yaqui
blanco sol trembled in all his great frame and then gale was certain the sound was not imagination
that certainty once for all fixed in gale's mind the mood of his flight
the yaqui dominated the horses and the rangers
thorne and mercedes were as persons under a spell
the indian's strange silence the feeling of mystery and power he seemed to create all that was incomprehensible about him were emphasized in the light of his slow sure and ruthless action
if he dominated the others surely he did more for galecolored his thoughtspresage the wild and terrible future of that flight
if rojas embodied all the hatred and passion of the peonscourged slave for a thousand yearsthen yaqui embodied all the darkness the cruelty the white sunheated blood the ferocity the tragedy of the desert
suddenly the indian stalked out of the gloom
he mounted diablo and headed across the river
once more the line of moving white shadows stretched out
the soft sand gave forth no sound at all
the glimmering campfires sank behind the western bank
yaqui led the way into the willows and there was faint swishing of leaves then into the mesquite and there was faint rustling of branches
the glimmering lights appeared again and grotesque forms of saguaros loomed darkly
gale peered sharply along the trail and presently on the pale sand under a cactus there lay a blanketed form prone outstretched a carbine clutched in one hand a cigarette still burning in the other
the cavalcade of white horses passed within five hundred yards of campfires around which dark forms moved in plain sight
soft pads in sand faint metallic tickings of steel on thorns low regular breathing of horsesthese were all the sounds the fugitives made and they could not have been heard at onefifth the distance
the lights disappeared from time to time grew dimmer more flickering and at last they vanished altogether
belding's fleet and tireless steeds were out in front the desert opened ahead wide dark vast
rojas and his rebels were behind eating drinking careless
the somber shadow lifted from gale's  heart
he held now an unquenchable faith in the yaqui
belding would be listening back there along the river
he would know of the escape
he would tell nell and then hide her safely
as gale accepted a strange and fatalistic foreshadowing of toil blood and agony in this desert journey so he believed in mercedes's ultimate freedom and happiness and his own return to the girl who had grown dearer than life
a cold gray dawn was fleeing before a rosy sun when yaqui halted the march at papago well
the horses were taken to water then led down the arroyo into the grass
here packs were slipped saddles removed
mercedes was cold lame tired but happy
it warmed gale's blood to look at her
the shadow of fear still lay in her eyes but it was passing
hope and courage shone there and affection for her ranger protectors and the yaqui and unutterable love for the cavalryman
jim lash remarked how cleverly they had fooled the rebels
shore they'll be comin' along replied ladd
they built a fire cooked and ate
the yaqui spoke only one word sleep
blankets were spread
mercedes dropped into a deep slumber her head on thorne's shoulder
excitement kept thorne awake
the two rangers dozed beside the fire
gale shared the yaqui's watch
the sun began to climb and the icy edge of dawn to wear away
rabbits bobbed their cotton tails under the mesquite
gale climbed a rocky wall above the arroyo bank and there with command over the miles of the backtrail he watched
it was a sweeping rolling wrinkled and streaked range of desert that he saw ruddy in the morning sunlight with patches of cactus and mesquite roughetched in shimmering gloom
no name mountains split the eastern sky towering high gloomy grand with purple veils upon their slopes
they were forty miles away and looked five
gale thought of the girl who was there under their shadow
yaqui kept the horses bunched and he led them from one little park of galleta grass to another
at the end of three hours he took them to water
upon his return gale clambered down from his outlook the rangers grew active
mercedes was awakened and soon the party faced westward their long shadows moving before them
yaqui led with blanco diablo in a long easy lope
the arroyo washed itself out into flat desert and the greens began to shade into gray and then the gray into red
only sparse cactus and weathered ledges dotted the great low roll of a rising escarpment
yaqui suited the gait of his horse to the lay of the land and his followers accepted his pace
there were canter and trot and swift walk and slow climb and long swingmiles up and down and forward
the sun soared hot
the heated air lifted and incoming currents from the west swept low and hard over the barren earth
in the distance all around the horizon accumulations of dust seemed like ranging mushrooming yellow clouds
yaqui was the only one of the fugitives who never looked back
mercedes did it the most
gale felt what compelled her he could not resist it himself
but it was a vain search
for a thousand puffs of white and yellow dust rose from that backward sweep of desert and any one of them might have been blown from under horses' hoofs
gale had a conviction that when yaqui gazed back toward the well and the shining plain beyond there would be reason for it
but when the sun lost its heat and the wind died down yaqui took long and careful surveys westward from the high points on the trail
sunset was not far off and there in a bare spotted valley lay coyote tanks the only waterhole between papago well and the sonoyta oasis
gale used his glass told yaqui there was no smoke no sign of life still the indian fixed his falcon eyes on distant spots looked long
it was as if his vision could not detect what reason or cunning or intuition perhaps an instinct told him was there
presently in a sheltered spot where blown sand had not obliterated the trail yaqui found the tracks of horses
the curve of the iron shoes pointed westward
an intersecting trail from the north came in here
gale thought the tracks either one or two days old
ladd said they were one day
the indian shook his head
no farther advance was undertaken
the yaqui headed south and traveled slowly climbing to the brow of a bold height of weathered mesa
there he sat his horse and waited
no one questioned him
the rangers dismounted to stretch their legs and mercedes was lifted to a rock where she rested
thorne had gradually yielded to the desert's influence for silence
he spoke once or twice to gale and occasionally whispered to mercedes
gale fancied his friend would soon learn that necessary speech in desert travel meant a few greetings a few words to make real the fact of human companionship a few short terse terms for the business of day or night and perhaps a stern order or a soft call to a horse
the sun went down and the golden rosy veils turned to blue and shaded darker till twilight was there in the valley
only the spurs of mountains spiring the near and far horizon retained their clear outline
darkness approached and the clear peaks faded
the horses stamped to be on the move
malo
exclaimed the yaqui
he did not point with arm but his falcon head was outstretched and his piercing eyes gazed at the blurring spot which marked the location of coyote tanks
jim can you see anything
asked ladd
nope but i reckon he can
darkness increased momentarily till night shaded the deepest part of the valley
then ladd suddenly straightened up turned to his horse and muttered low under his breath
i reckon so said lash and for once his easy goodnatured tone was not in evidence
his voice was harsh
gale's eyes keen as they were were last of the rangers to see tiny needlepoints of light just faintly perceptible in the blackness
laddy
campfires
he asked quickly
shore's you're born my boy
how many
ladd did not reply but yaqui held up his hand his fingers wide
five campfires
a strong force of rebels or raiders or some other desert troop was camping at coyote tanks
yaqui sat his horse for a moment motionless as stone his dark face immutable and impassive
then he stretched wide his right arm in the direction of no name mountains now losing their last faint traces of the afterglow and he shook his head
he made the same impressive gesture toward the sonoyta oasis with the same somber negation
thereupon he turned diablo's head to the south and started down the slope
his manner had been decisive even stern
lash did not question it nor did ladd
both rangers hesitated however and showed a strange almost sullen reluctance which gale had never seen in them before
raiders were one thing rojas was another camino del diablo still another but that vast and desolate and unwatered waste of cactus and lava the sonora desert might appall the stoutest heart
gale felt his own sinkfelt himself flinch
oh where is he going
cried mercedes
her poignant voice seemed to break a spell
shore lady yaqui's goin' home replied ladd gently
an' considerin' our troubles i reckon we ought to thank god he knows the way
they mounted and rode down the slope toward the darkening south
not until night travel was obstructed by a wall of cactus did the indian halt to make a dry camp
water and grass for the horses and fire to cook by were not to be had
mercedes bore up surprisingly but she fell asleep almost the instant her thirst had been allayed
thorne laid her upon a blanket and covered her
the men ate and drank
diablo was the only horse that showed impatience but he was angry and not in distress
blanco sol licked gale's hand and stood patiently
many a time had he taken his rest at night without a drink
yaqui again bade the men sleep
ladd said he would take the early watch but from the way the indian shook his head and settled himself against a stone it appeared if ladd remained awake he would have company
gale lay down weary of limb and eye
he heard the soft thump of hoofs the sough of wind in the cactusthen no more
when he awoke there was bustle and stir about him
day had not yet dawned and the air was freezing cold
yaqui had found a scant bundle of greasewood which served to warm them and to cook breakfast
mercedes was not aroused till the last moment
day dawned with the fugitives in the saddle
a picketed wall of cactus hedged them in yet the yaqui made a tortuous path that zigzag as it might in the main always headed south
it was wonderful how he slipped diablo through the narrow aisles of thorns saving the horse and saving himself
the others were torn and clutched and held and stung
the way was a flat sandy pass between low mountain ranges
there were open spots and aisles and squares of sand and hedging rows of prickly pear and the huge spiderlegged ocatillo and hummocky masses of clustered bisnagi
the day grew dry and hot
a fragrant wind blew through the pass
cactus flowers bloomed red and yellow and magenta
the sweet pale ajo lily gleamed in shady corners
ten miles of travel covered the length of the pass
it opened wide upon a wonderful scene an arboreal desert dominated by its pure light green yet lined by many merging colors
and it rose slowly to a low dim and darkred zone of lava spurred peaked domed by volcano cones a wild and ragged region illimitable as the horizon
the yaqui if not at fault was yet uncertain
his falcon eyes searched and roved and became fixed at length at the southwest and toward this he turned his horse
the great fluted saguaros fifty sixty feet high raised columnal forms and their branching limbs and curving lines added a grace to the desert
it was the lowbushed cactus that made the toil and pain of travel
yet these thorny forms were beautiful
in the basins between the ridges to right and left along the floor of low plains the mirage glistened wavered faded vanishedlakes and trees and clouds
inverted mountains hung suspended in the lilac air and faint tracery of whitewalled cities
at noon yaqui halted the cavalcade
he had selected a field of bisnagi cactus for the place of rest
presently his reason became obvious
with long heavy knife he cut off the tops of these barrelshaped plants
he scooped out soft pulp and with stone and hand then began to pound the deeper pulp into a juicy mass
when he threw this out there was a little water left sweet cool water which man and horse shared eagerly
thus he made even the desert's fiercest growths minister to their needs
but he did not halt long
miles of graygreen spiked walls lay between him and that line of ragged red lava which manifestly he must reach before dark
the travel became faster straighter
and the glistening thorns clutched and clung to leather and cloth and flesh
the horses reared snorted balked leapedbut they were sent on
only blanco sol the patient the plodding the indomitable needed no goad or spur
waves and scarfs and wreaths of heat smoked up from the sand
mercedes reeled in her saddle
thorne bade her drink bathed her face supported her and then gave way to ladd who took the girl with him on torre's broad back
yaqui's unflagging purpose and iron arm were bitter and hateful to the proud and haughty spirit of blanco diablo
for once belding's great white devil had met his master
he fought rider bit bridle cactus sandand yet he went on and on zigzagging turning winding crashing through the barbed growths
the middle of the afternoon saw thorne reeling in his saddle and then wherever possible gale's powerful arm lent him strength to hold his seat
the giant cactus came to be only so in name
these saguaros were thinning out growing stunted and most of them were single columns
gradually other cactus forms showed a harder struggle for existence and the spaces of sand between were wider
but now the dreaded glistening choya began to show pale and gray and white upon the rising slope
roundtopped hills sunsetcolored above blueblack below intervened to hide the distant spurs and peaks
mile and mile long tongues of red lava streamed out between the hills and wound down to stop abruptly upon the slope
the fugitives were entering a desolate burnedout world
it rose above them in limitless gradual ascent and spread wide to east and west
then the waste of sand began to yield to cinders
the horses sank to their fetlocks as they toiled on
a fine choking dust blew back from the leaders and men coughed and horses snorted
the huge round hills rose smooth symmetrical colored as if the setting sun was shining on bare blueblack surfaces
but the sun was now behind the hills
in between ran the streams of lava
the horsemen skirted the edge between slope of hill and perpendicular ragged wall
this red lava seemed to have flowed and hardened there only yesterday
it was broken sharp dull rust color full of cracks and caves and crevices and everywhere upon its jagged surface grew the whitethorned choya
again twilight encompassed the travelers
but there was still light enough for gale to see the constricted passage open into a wide deep space where the dull color was relieved by the gray of gnarled and dwarfed mesquite
blanco sol keenest of scent whistled his welcome herald of water
the other horses answered quickened their gait
gale smelled it too sweet cool damp on the dry air
yaqui turned the corner of a pocket in the lava wall
the file of white horses rounded the corner after him
and gale coming last saw the pale glancing gleam of a pool of water beautiful in the twilight
next day the yaqui's relentless driving demand on the horses was no longer in evidence
he lost no time but he did not hasten
his course wound between low cinder dunes which limited their view of the surrounding country
these dunes finally sank down to a black floor as hard as flint with tongues of lava to the left and to the right the slow descent into the cactus plain
yaqui was now traveling due west
it was gale's idea that the indian was skirting the first sharptoothed slope of a vast volcanic plateau which formed the western half of the sonora desert and extended to the gulf of california
travel was slow but not exhausting for rider or beast
a little sand and meager grass gave a grayish tinge to the strip of black ground between lava and plain
that day as the manner rather than the purpose of the yaqui changed so there seemed to be subtle differences in the others of the party
gale himself lost a certain sickening dread which had not been for himself but for mercedes and nell and thorne and the rangers
jim goodnatured again might have been patrolling the boundary line
ladd lost his taciturnity and his gloom changed to a cool careless air
a mood that was almost defiance began to be manifested in thorne
it was in mercedes however that gale marked the most significant change
her collapse the preceding day might never have been
she was lame and sore she rode her saddle sidewise and often she had to be rested and helped but she had found a reserve fund of strength and her mental condition was not the same that it had been
her burden of fear had been lifted
gale saw in her the difference he always felt in himself after a few days in the desert
already mercedes and he and all of them had begun to respond to the desert spirit
moreover yaqui's strange influence must have been a call to the primitive
thirty miles of easy stages brought the fugitives to another waterhole a little round pocket under the heavedup edge of lava
there was spare short bleached grass for the horses but no wood for a fire
this night there was question and reply conjecture doubt opinion and conviction expressed by the men of the party
but the indian who alone could have told where they were where they were going what chance they had to escape maintained his stoical silence
gale took the early watch ladd the midnight one and lash that of the morning
the day broke rosy glorious cold as ice
action was necessary to make useful benumbed hands and feet
mercedes was fed while yet wrapped in blankets
then while the packs were being put on and horses saddled she walked up and down slapping her hands warming her ears
the rose color of the dawn was in her cheeks and the wonderful clearness of desert light in her eyes
thorne's eyes sought her constantly
the rangers watched her
the yaqui bent his glance upon her only seldom but when he did look it seemed that his strange fixed and inscrutable face was about to break into a smile
yet that never happened
gale himself was surprised to find how often his own glance found the slender dark beautiful spaniard
was this because of her beauty
he wondered
he thought not altogether
mercedes was a woman
she represented something in life that men of all races for thousands of years had loved to see and own to revere and debase to fight and die for
it was a significant index to the day's travel that yaqui should keep a blanket from the pack and tear it into strips to bind the legs of the horses
it meant the dreaded choya and the knifeedged lava
that yaqui did not mount diablo was still more significant
mercedes must ride but the others must walk
the indian led off into one of the gray notches between the tumbled streams of lava
these streams were about thirty feet high a rotting mass of splintered lava rougher than any other kind of roughness in the world
at the apex of the notch where two streams met a narrow gully wound and ascended
gale caught sight of the dim pale shadow of a onetime trail
near at hand it was invisible he had to look far ahead to catch the faint tracery
yaqui led diablo into it and then began the most laborious and vexatious and painful of all slow travel
once up on top of that lava bed gale saw stretching away breaking into millions of crests and ruts a vast redblack field sweeping onward and upward with ragged low ridges and mounds and spurs leading higher and higher to a great split escarpment wall above which dim peaks shone hazily blue in the distance
he looked no more in that direction
to keep his foothold to save his horse cost him all energy and attention
the course was marked out for him in the tracks of the other horses
he had only to follow
but nothing could have been more difficult
the disintegrating surface of a lava bed was at once the roughest the hardest the meanest the cruelest the most deceitful kind of ground to travel
it was rotten yet it had corners as hard and sharp as pikes
it was rough yet as slippery as ice
if there was a foot of level surface that space would be one to break through under a horse's hoofs
it was seamed lined cracked ridged knotted iron
this lava bed resembled a tremendously magnified clinker
it had been a running sea of molten flint boiling bubbling spouting and it had burst its surface into a million sharp facets as it hardened
the color was dull dark angry red like no other red inflaming to the eye
the millions of minute crevices were dominated by deep fissures and holes ragged and rough beyond all comparison
the fugitives made slow progress
they picked a cautious winding way to and fro in little steps here and there along the many twists of the trail up and down the unavoidable depressions round and round the holes
at noon so winding back upon itself had been their course they appeared to have come only a short distance up the lava slope
it was rough work for them it was terrible work for the horses
blanco diablo refused to answer to the power of the yaqui
he balked he plunged he bit and kicked
he had to be pulled and beaten over many places
mercedes's horse almost threw her and she was put upon blanco sol
the white charger snorted a protest then obedient to gale's stern call patiently lowered his noble head and pawed the lava for a footing that would hold
the lava caused gale toil and worry and pain but he hated the choyas
as the travel progressed this species of cactus increased in number of plants and in size
everywhere the red lava was spotted with little round patches of glistening frosty white
and under every bunch of choya along and in the trail were the discarded joints like little frosty pine cones covered with spines
it was utterly impossible always to be on the lookout for these and when gale stepped on one often as not the steellike thorns pierced leather and flesh
gale came almost to believe what he had heard claimed by desert travelersthat the choya was alive and leaped at man or beast
certain it was when gale passed one if he did not put all attention to avoiding it he was hooked through his chaps and held by barbed thorns
the pain was almost unendurable
it was like no other
it burned stung beatalmost seemed to freeze
it made useless arm or leg
it made him bite his tongue to keep from crying out
it made the sweat roll off him
it made him sick
moreover bad as the choya was for man it was infinitely worse for beast
a jagged stab from this poisoned cactus was the only thing blanco sol could not stand
many times that day before he carried mercedes he had wildly snorted and then stood trembling while gale picked broken thorns from the muscular legs
but after mercedes had been put upon sol gale made sure no choya touched him
the afternoon passed like the morning in ceaseless winding and twisting and climbing along this abandoned trail
gale saw many waterholes mostly dry some containing water all of them catchbasins full only after rainy season
little ugly bunched bushes that gale scarcely recognized as mesquites grew near these holes also stunted greasewood and prickly pear
there was no grass and the choya alone flourished in that hard soil
darkness overtook the party as they unpacked beside a pool of water deep under an overhanging shelf of lava
it had been a hard day
the horses drank their fill and then stood patiently with drooping heads
hunger and thirst appeased and a warm fire cheered the weary and footsore fugitives
yaqui said sleep
and so another night passed
upon the following morning ten miles or more up the slowascending lava slope gale's attention was called from his somber search for the less rough places in the trail
dick why does yaqui look back
asked mercedes
gale was startled
does he
every little while replied mercedes
gale was in the rear of all the other horses so as to take for mercedes's sake the advantage of the broken trail
yaqui was leading diablo winding around a break
his head was bent as he stepped slowly and unevenly upon the lava
gale turned to look back the first time in several days
the mighty hollow of the desert below seemed wide strip of redwide strip of greenwide strip of graystreaking to purple peaks
it was all too vast too mighty to grasp any little details
he thought of course of rojas in certain pursuit but it seemed absurded to look for him
yaqui led on and gale often glanced up from his task to watch the indian
presently he saw him stop turn and look back
ladd did likewise and then jim and thorne
gale found the desire irresistible
thereafter he often rested blanco sol and looked back the while
he had his fieldglass but did not choose to use it
rojas will follow said mercedes
gale regarded her in amaze
the tone of her voice had been indefinable
if there were fear then he failed to detect it
she was gazing back down the colored slope and something about her perhaps the steady falcon gaze of her magnificent eyes reminded him of yaqui
many times during the ensuing hour the indian faced about and always his followers did likewise
it was high noon with the sun beating hot and the lava radiating heat when yaqui halted for a rest
the place selected was a ridge of lava almost a promontory considering its outlook
the horses bunched here and drooped their heads
the rangers were about to slip the packs and remove saddles when yaqui restrained them
he fixed a changeless gleaming gaze on the slow descent but did not seem to look afar
suddenly he uttered his strange crythe one gale considered involuntary or else significant of some tribal trait or feeling
it was incomprehensible but no one could have doubted its potency
yaqui pointed down the lava slope pointed with finger and arm and neck and headhis whole body was instinct with direction
his whole being seemed to have been animated and then frozen
his posture could not have been misunderstood yet his expression had not altered
gale had never seen the indian's face change its hard redbronze calm
it was the color and the flintiness and the character of the lava at his feet
shore he sees somethin' said ladd
but my eyes are not good
i reckon i ain't sure of mine replied jim
i'm bothered by a dim movin' streak down there
thorne gazed eagerly down as he stood beside mercedes who sat motionless facing the slope
gale looked and looked till he hurt his eyes
then he took his glass out of its case on sol's saddle
there appeared to be nothing upon the lava but the innumerable dots of choya shining in the sun
gale swept his glass slowly forward and back
then into a nearer field of vision crept a long whiteandblack line of horses and men
without a word he handed the glass to ladd
the ranger used it muttering to himself
they're on the lava fifteen miles down in an air line he said presently
jim shore they're twice that an' more accordin' to the trail
jim had his look and replied  i reckon we're a day an' a night in the lead
is it rojas
burst out thorne with set jaw
yes thorne
it's rojas and a dozen men or more replied gale and he looked up at mercedes
she was transformed
she might have been a medieval princess embodying all the spanish power and passion of that time breathing revenge hate unquenchable spirit of fire
if her beauty had been wonderful in her helpless and appealing moments now when she looked back whitefaced and flameeyed it was transcendant
gale drew a long deep breath
the mood which had presaged pursuit strife blood on this somber desert returned to him tenfold
he saw thorne's face corded by black veins and his teeth exposed like those of a snarling wolf
these rangers who had coolly risked death many times and had dealt it often were white as no fear or pain could have made them
then on the moment yaqui raised his hand not clenched or doubled tight but curled rigid like an eagle's claw and he shook it in a strange slow gesture which was menacing and terrible
it was the woman that called to the depths of these men
and their passion to kill and to save was surpassed only by the wild hate which was yet love the unfathomable emotion of a peon slave
gale marveled at it while he felt his whole being cold and tense as he turned once more to follow in the tracks of his leaders
the fight predicted by belding was at hand
what a fight that must be
rojas was traveling light and fast
he was gaining
he had bought his men with gold with extravagant promises perhaps with offers of the body and blood of an aristocrat hateful to their kind
lastly there was the wild desolate environment a tortured wilderness of jagged lava and poisoned choya a lonely fierce and repellant world a red stage most somberly and fittingly colored for a supreme struggle between men
yaqui looked back no more
mercedes looked back no more
but the others looked and the time came when gale saw the creeping line of pursuers with naked eyes
a level line above marked the rim of the plateau
sand began to show in the little lava pits
on and upward toiled the cavalcade still very slowly advancing
at last yaqui reached the rim
he stood with his hand on blanco diablo and both were silhouetted against the sky
that was the outlook for a yaqui
and his great horse dazzlingly white in the sunlight with head wildly and proudly erect mane and tail flying in the wind made a magnificent picture
the others toiled on and upward and at last gale led blanco sol over the rim
then all looked down the red slope
but shadows were gathering there and no moving line could be seen
yaqui mounted and wheeled diablo away
the others followed
gale saw that the plateau was no more than a vast field of low ragged circles levels mounds cones and whirls of lava
the lava was of a darker red than that down upon the slope and it was harder than flint
in places fine sand and cinders covered the uneven floor
strange varieties of cactus vied with the omnipresent choya
yaqui however found ground that his horse covered at a swift walk
but there was only an hour perhaps of this comparatively easy going
then the yaqui led them into a zone of craters
the top of the earth seemed to have been blown out in holes from a few rods in width to large craters some shallow others deep and all red as fire
yaqui circled close to abysses which yawned sheer from a level surface and he appeared always to be turning upon his course to avoid them
the plateau had now a considerable dip to the west
gale marked the slow heave and ripple of the ocean of lava to the south where high rounded peaks marked the center of this volcanic region
the uneven nature of the slope westward prevented any extended view until suddenly the fugitives emerged from a rugged break to come upon a sublime and aweinspiring spectacle
they were upon a high point of the western slope of the plateau
it was a slope but so many leagues long in its descent that only from a height could any slant have been perceptible
yaqui and his white horse stood upon the brink of a crater miles in circumference a thousand feet deep with its red walls patched in frostcolored spots by the silvery choya
the giant tracery of lava streams waved down the slope to disappear in undulating sand dunes
and these bordered a seemingly endless arm of blue sea
this was the gulf of california
beyond the gulf rose dim bold mountains and above them hung the setting sun dusky red flooding all that barren empire with a sinister light
it was strange to gale then and perhaps to the others to see their guide lead diablo into a smooth and wellworn trail along the rim of the awful crater
gale looked down into that red chasm
it resembled an inferno
the dark cliffs upon the opposite side were veiled in blue haze that seemed like smoke
here yaqui was at home
he moved and looked about him as a man coming at last into his own
gale saw him stop and gaze out over that redribbed void to the gulf
gale devined that somewhere along this crater of hell the yaqui would make his final stand and one look into his strange inscrutable eyes made imagination picture a fitting doom for the pursuing rojas
xii  the crater of hell  the trail led along a gigantic fissure in the side of the crater and then down and down into a redwalled blue hazed labyrinth
presently gale upon turning a sharp corner was utterly amazed to see that the split in the lava sloped out and widened into an arroyo
it was so green and soft and beautiful in all the angry contorted red surrounding that gale could scarcely credit his sight
blanco sol whistled his welcome to the scent of water
then gale saw a great hole a pit in the shiny lava a dark cool shady well
there was evidence of the fact that at flood seasons the water had an outlet into the arroyo
the soil appeared to be a fine sand in which a reddish tinge predominated and it was abundantly covered with a long grass still partly green
mesquites and palo verdes dotted the arroyo and gradually closed in thickets that obstructed the view
shore it all beats me exclaimed ladd
what a place to holeup in
we could have hid here for a long time
boys i saw mountain sheep the real old genuine rocky mountain bighorn
what do you think of that
i reckon it's a yaqui huntingground replied lash
that trail we hit must be hundreds of years old
it's worn deep and smooth in iron lava
well all i got to say isbeldin' was shore right about the indian
an' i can see rojas's finish somewhere up along that awful hellhole
camp was made on a level spot
yaqui took the horses to water and then turned them loose in the arroyo
it was a tired and somber group that sat down to eat
the strain of suspense equaled the wearing effects of the long ride
mercedes was calm but her great dark eyes burned in her white face
yaqui watched her
the others looked at her with unspoken pride
presently thorne wrapped her in his blankets and she seemed to fall asleep at once
twilight deepened
the campfire blazed brighter
a cool wind played with mercedes's black hair waving strands across her brow
little of yaqui's purpose or plan could be elicited from him
but the look of him was enough to satisfy even thorne
he leaned against a pile of wood which he had collected and his gloomy gaze pierced the campfire and at long intervals strayed over the motionless form of the spanish girl
the rangers and thorne however talked in low tones
it was absolutely impossible for rojas and his men to reach the waterhole before noon of the next day
and long before that time the fugitives would have decided on a plan of defense
what that defense would be and where it would be made were matters over which the men considered gravely
ladd averred the yaqui would put them into an impregnable position that at the same time would prove a deathtrap for their pursuers
they exhausted every possibility and then tired as they were still kept on talking
what stuns me is that rojas stuck to our trail said thorne his lined and haggard face expressive of dark passion
he has followed us into this fearful desert
he'll lose men horses perhaps his life
he's only a bandit and he stands to win no gold
if he ever gets out of here it 'll be by herculean labor and by terrible hardship
all for a poor little helpless womanjust a woman
my god i can't understand it
shorejust a woman replied ladd solemnly nodding his head
then there was a long silence during which the men gazed into the fire
each perhaps had some vague conception of the enormity of rojas's love or hatesome faint and amazing glimpse of the gulf of human passion
those were cold hard grim faces upon which the light flickered
sleep said the yaqui
thorne rolled in his blanket close beside mercedes
then one by one the rangers stretched out feet to the fire
gale found that he could not sleep
his eyes were weary but they would not stay shut his body ached for rest yet he could not lie still
the night was so somber so gloomy and the lavaencompassed arroyo full of shadows
the dark velvet sky fretted with white fire seemed to be close
there was an absolute silence as of death
nothing movednothing outside of gale's body appeared to live
the yaqui sat like an image carved out of lava
the others lay prone and quiet
would another night see any of them lie that way quiet forever
gale felt a ripple pass over him that was at once a shudder and a contraction of muscles
used as he was to the desert and its oppression why should he feel tonight as if the weight of its lava and the burden of its mystery were bearing him down
he sat up after a while and again watched the fire
nell's sweet face floated like a wraith in the pale smokeglowed and flushed and smiled in the embers
other faces shone therehis sister'sthat of his mother
gale shook off the tender memories
this desolate wilderness with its forbidding silence and its dark promise of hell on the morrowthis was not the place to unnerve oneself with thoughts of love and home
but the torturing paradox of the thing was that this was just the place and just the night for a man to be haunted
by and by gale rose and walked down a shadowy aisle between the mesquites
on his way back the yaqui joined him
gale was not surprised
he had become used to the indian's strange guardianship
but now perhaps because of gale's poignancy of thought the contending tides of love and regret the deep burning premonition of deadly strife he was moved to keener scrutiny of the yaqui
that of course was futile
the indian was impenetrable silent strange
but suddenly inexplicably gale felt yaqui's human quality
it was aloof as was everything about this indian but it was there
this savage walked silently beside him without glance or touch or word
his thought was as inscrutable as if mind had never awakened in his race
yet gale was conscious of greatness and somehow he was reminded of the indian's story
his home had been desolated his people carried off to slavery his wife and children separated from him to die
what had life meant to the yaqui
what had been in his heart
what was now in his mind
gale could not answer these questions
but the difference between himself and yaqui which he had vaguely felt as that between savage and civilized men faded out of his mind forever
yaqui might have considered he owed gale a debt and with a yaqui's austere and noble fidelity to honor he meant to pay it
nevertheless this was not the thing gale found in the indian's silent presence
accepting the desert with its subtle and inconceivable influence gale felt that the savage and the white man had been bound in a tie which was no less brotherly because it could not be comprehended
toward dawn gale managed to get some sleep
then the morning broke with the sun hidden back of the uplift of the plateau
the horses trooped up the arroyo and snorted for water
after a hurried breakfast the packs were hidden in holes in the lava
the saddles were left where they were and the horses allowed to graze and wander at will
canteens were filled a small bag of food was packed and blankets made into a bundle
then yaqui faced the steep ascent of the lava slope
the trail he followed led up on the right side of the fissure opposite to the one he had come down
it was a steep climb and encumbered as the men were they made but slow progress
mercedes had to be lifted up smooth steps and across crevices
they passed places where the rims of the fissure were but a few yards apart
at length the rims widened out and the red smoky crater yawned beneath
yaqui left the trail and began clambering down over the rough and twisted convolutions of lava which formed the rim
sometimes he hung sheer over the precipice
it was with extreme difficulty that the party followed him
mercedes had to be held on narrow footwide ledges
the choya was there to hinder passage
finally the indian halted upon a narrow bench of flat smooth lava and his followers worked with exceeding care and effort down to his position
at the back of this bench between bunches of choya was a niche a shallow cave with floor lined apparently with mold
ladd said the place was a refuge which had been inhabited by mountain sheep for many years
yaqui spread blankets inside left the canteen and the sack of food and with a gesture at once humble yet that of a chief he invited mercedes to enter
a few more gestures and fewer words disclosed his plan
in this inaccessible nook mercedes was to be hidden
the men were to go around upon the opposite rim and block the trail leading down to the waterhole
gale marked the nature of this eyrie
it was the wildest and most rugged place he had ever stepped upon
only a sheep could have climbed up the wall above or along the slanting shelf of lava beyond
below glistened a whole bank of choya frosty in the sunlight and it overhung an apparently bottomless abyss
ladd chose the smallest gun in the party and gave it to mercedes
shore it's best to go the limit on bein' ready he said simply
the chances are you'll never need it
but if you do  he left off there and his break was significant
mercedes answered him with a fearless and indomitable flash of eyes
thorne was the only one who showed any shaken nerve
his leavetaking of his wife was affecting and hurried
then he and the rangers carefully stepped in the tracks of the yaqui
they climbed up to the level of the rim and went along the edge
when they reached the fissure and came upon its narrowest point yaqui showed in his actions that he meant to leap it
ladd restrained the indian
they then continued along the rim till they reached several bridges of lava which crossed it
the fissures was deep in some parts choked in others
evidently the crater had no direct outlet into the arroyo below
its bottom however must have been far beneath the level of the waterhole
after the fissure was crossed the trail was soon found
here it ran back from the rim
yaqui waved his hand to the right where along the corrugated slope of the crater there were holes and crevices and coverts for a hundred men
yaqui strode on up the trail toward a higher point where presently his dark figure stood motionless against the sky
the rangers and thorne selected a deep depression out of which led several ruts deep enough for cover
according to ladd it was as good a place as any perhaps not so hidden as others but freer from the dreaded choya
here the men laid down rifles and guns and removing their heavy cartridge belts settled down to wait
their location was close to the rim wall and probably five hundred yards from the opposite rim which was now seen to be considerably below them
the glaring red cliff presented a deceitful and baffling appearance
it had a thousand ledges and holes in its surfaces and one moment it looked perpendicular and the next there seemed to be a long slant
thorne pointed out where he thought mercedes was hidden ladd selected another place and lash still another
gale searched for the bank of choya he had seen under the bench where mercedes's retreat lay and when he found it the others disputed his opinion
then gale brought his field glass into requisition proving that he  was right
once located and fixed in sight the white patch of choya the bench and the sheep eyrie stood out from the other features of that rugged wall
but all the men were agreed that yaqui had hidden mercedes where only the eyes of a vulture could have found her
jim lash crawled into a little strip of shade and bided the time tranquilly
ladd was restless and impatient and watchful every little while rising to look up the farreaching slope and then to the right where yaqui's dark figure stood out from a high point of the rim
thorne grew silent and seemed consumed by a slow sullen rage
gale was neither calm nor free of a gnawing suspense nor of a waiting wrath
but as best he could he put the pending action out of mind
it came over him all of a sudden that he had not grasped the stupendous nature of this desert setting
there was the measureless red slope its lower ridges finally sinking into white sand dunes toward the blue sea
the cold sparkling light the white sun the deep azure of sky the feeling of boundless expanse all around himthese meant high altitude
southward the barren red simply merged into distance
the field of craters rose in high dark wheels toward the dominating peaks
when gale withdrew his gaze from the magnitude of these spaces and heights the crater beneath him seemed dwarfed
yet while he gazed it spread and deepened and multiplied its ragged lines
no he could not grasp the meaning of size or distance here
there was too much to stun the sight
but the mood in which nature had created this convulsed world of lava seized hold upon him
meanwhile the hours passed
as the sun climbed the clear steely lights vanished the blue hazes deepened and slowly the glistening surfaces of lava turned redder
ladd was concerned to discover that yaqui was missing from his outlook upon the high point
jim lash came out of the shady crevice and stood up to buckle on his cartridge belt
his narrow gray glance slowly roved from the height of lava down along the slope paused in doubt and then swept on to resurvey the whole vast eastern dip of the plateau
i reckon my eyes are pore he said
mebbe it's this damn red glare
anyway what's them creepin' spots up there
shore i seen them
mountain sheep replied ladd
guess again laddy
dick i reckon you'd better flash the glass up the slope
gale adjusted the field glass and began to search the lava beginning close at hand and working away from him
presently the glass became stationary
i see half a dozen small animals brown in color
they look like sheep
but i couldn't distinguish mountain sheep from antelope
shore they're bighorn said laddy
i reckon if you'll pull around to the east an' search under that long wall of lavathereyou'll see what i see added jim
the glass climbed and circled wavered an instant then fixed steady as a rock
there was a breathless silence
fourteen horsestwo packedsome mountedothers without riders and lame said gale slowly
yaqui appeared far up the trail coming swiftly
presently he saw the rangers and halted to wave his arms and point
then he vanished as if the lava had opened beneath him
lemme that glass suddenly said jim lash
i'm seein' red i tell you well pore as my eyes are they had it right
rojas an' his outfit have left the trail
jim you ain't meanin' they've taken to that awful slope
queried ladd
i sure do
there they arestill comin' but goin' down too
mebbe rojas is crazy but it begins to look like he  laddy i'll be danged if the greaser bunch hasn't vamoosed
gone out of sight
right there not a half mile away the whole caboodlegone
shore they're behind a crust or have gone down into a rut suggested ladd
they'll show again in a minute
look sharp boys for i'm figgerin' rojas 'll spread his men
minutes passed but nothing moved upon the slope
each man crawled up to a vantage point along the crest of rotting lava
the watchers were careful to peer through little notches or from behind a spur and the constricted nature of their hidingplace kept them close together
ladd's muttering grew into a growl then lapsed into the silence that marked his companions
from time to time the rangers looked inquiringly at gale
the field glass however like the naked sight could not catch the slightest moving object out there upon the lava
a long hour of slow mounting suspense wore on
shore it's all goin' to be as queer as the yaqui said ladd
indeed the strange mien the silent action the somber character of the indian had not been without effect upon the minds of the men
then the weird desolate tragic scene added to the vague sense of mystery
and now the disappearance of rojas's band the long wait in the silence the boding certainty of invisible foes crawling circling closer and closer lent to the situation a final touch that made it unreal
i'm reckonin' there's a mind behind them greasers replied jim
or mebbe we ain't done rojas credit
if somethin' would only come off
that lash the coolest most provokingly nonchalant of men in times of peril should begin to show a nervous strain was all the more indicative of a subtle pervading unreality
boys look sharp
suddenly called lash
low down to the leftmebbe three hundred yards
see along by them seams of lavabehind the choyas
first off i thought it was a sheep
but it's the yaqui
crawlin' swift as a lizard
can't you see him
it was a full moment before jim's companions could locate the indian
flat as a snake yaqui wound himself along with incredible rapidity
his advance was all the more remarkable for the fact that he appeared to pass directly under the dreaded choyas
sometimes he paused to lift his head and look
he was directly in line with a huge whorl of lava that rose higher than any point on the slope
this spur was a quarter of a mile from the position of the rangers
shore he's headin' for that high place  said ladd
he's goin' slow now
there he's stopped behind some choyas
he's gettin' upno he's kneelin' now what the hell
laddy take a peek at the side of that lava ridge sharply called jim
i guess mebbe somethin' ain't comin' off
see
there's rojas an' his outfit climbin'
don't make out no hosses dick use your glass an' tell us what's doin'
i'll watch yaqui an' tell you what his move means
clearly and distinctly almost as if he could have touched them gale had rojas and his followers in sight
they were toiling up the rough lava on foot
they were heavily armed
spurs chaps jackets scarfs were not in evidence
gale saw the lean swarthy faces the black straggly hair the ragged soiled garments which had once been white
they're almost up now gale was saying
there
they halt on top
i see rojas
he looks wild
by 
fellows an indian
it's a papago
belding's old herder
the indian pointsthis waythen down
he's showing rojas the lay of the trail
boys yaqui's in range of that bunch said jim swiftly
he's raisin' his rifle slowlord how slow he is
he's covered some one
which one i can't say
but i think he'll pick rojas
the yaqui can shoot
he'll pick rojas added gale grimly
rojasyesyes
cried thorne in passion of suspense
not on your life
ladd's voice cut in with scorn
gentlemen you can gamble yaqui 'll kill the papago
that traitor indian knows these sheep haunts
he's tellin' rojas  a sharp rifle shot rang out
laddy's right called gale
the papago's hithis arm fallsthere he tumbles
more shots rang out
yaqui was seen standing erect firing rapidly at the darting mexicans
for all gale could make out no second bullet took effect
rojas and his men vanished behind the bulge of lava
then yaqui deliberately backed away from his position
he made no effort to run or hide
evidently he watched cautiously for signs of pursuers in the ruts and behind the choyas
presently he turned and came straight toward the position of the rangers sheered off perhaps a hundred paces below it and disappeared in a crevice
plainly his intention was to draw pursuers within rifle shot
shore jim you had your wish
somethin' come off said ladd
an' i'm sayin' thank god for the yaqui
that papago 'd have ruined us
even so mebbe he's told rojas more'n enough to make us sweat blood
he had a chance to kill rojas cried out the drawnfaced passionate thorne
he didn't take it
he didn't take it
only ladd appeared to be able to answer the cavalryman's poignant cry
listen son he said and his voice rang
weall know how you feel
an' if i'd had that one shot never in the world could i have picked the papago guide
i'd have had to kill rojas
that's the white man of it
but yaqui was right
only an indian could have done it
you can gamble the papago alive meant slim chance for us
because he'd led straight to where mercedes is hidden an' then we'd have left cover to fight it out
when you come to think of the yaqui's hate for greasers when you just seen him pass up a shot at onewell i don't know how to say what i mean but damn me my sombrerro is off to the indian
i reckon so an' i reckon the ball's opened rejoined lash and now that former nervous impatience so unnatural to him was as if it had never been
he was smilingly cool and his voice had almost a caressing note
he tapped the breech of his winchester with a sinewy brown hand and he did not appear to be addressing any one in particular
yaqui's opened the ball
look up your pardners there gents an' get ready to dance
another wait set in then and judging by the more direct rays of the sun and a receding of the little shadows cast by the choyas gale was of the opinion that it was a long wait
but it seemed short
the four men were lying under the bank of a half circular hole in the lava
it was notched and cracked and its rim was fringed by choyas
it sloped down and opened to an unobstructed view of the crater
gale had the upper position fartherest to the right and therefore was best shielded from possible fire from the higher ridges of the rim some three hundred yards distant
jim came next well hidden in a crack
the positions of thorne and ladd were most exposed
they kept sharp lookout over the uneven rampart of their hidingplace
the sun passed the zenith began to slope westward and to grow hotter as it sloped
the men waited and waited
gale saw no impatience even in thorne
the sultry air seemed to be laden with some burden or quality that was at once composed of heat menace color and silence
even the light glancing up from the lava seemed red and the silence had substance
sometimes gale felt that it was unbearable
yet he made no effort to break it
suddenly this dead stillness was rent by a shot clear and stinging close at hand
it was from a rifle not a carbine
with startling quickness a cry followeda cry that pierced galeit was so thin so highkeyed so different from all other cries
it was the involuntary human shriek at death
yaqui's called out another pardner said jim lash laconically
carbines began to crack
the reports were quick light like sharp spats without any ring
gale peered from behind the edge of his covert
above the ragged wave of lava floated faint whitish clouds all that was visible of smokeless powder
then gale made out round spots dark against the background of red and in front of them leaped out small tongues of fire
ladd's  began to spang with its beautiful sound of power
thorne was firing somewhat wildly gale thought
then jim lash pushed his winchester over the rim under a choya and between shots gale could hear him singing turn the lady turnturn the lady turn
alaman left
swing your pardners
forward an' back
turn the lady turn
gale got into the fight himself not so sure that he hit any of the round bobbing objects he aimed at but growing sure of himself as action liberated something forced and congested within his breast
then over the position of the rangers came a hail of steel bullets
those that struck the lava hissed away into the crater those that came biting through the choyas made a sound which resembled a sharp ripping of silk
bits of cactus stung gale's face and he dreaded the flying thorns more than he did the flying bullets
hold on boys called ladd as he crouched down to reload his rifle
save your shells
the greasers are spreadin' on us some goin' down below yaqui others movin' up for that high ridge
when they get up there i'm damned if it won't be hot for us
there ain't room for all of us to hide here
ladd raised himself to peep over the rim
shots were now scattering and all appeared to come from below
emboldened by this he rose higher
a shot from in front a rip of bullet through the choya a spat of something hitting ladd's face a steel missile hissing onwardthese inseparably blended sounds were all registered by gale's sensitive ear
with a curse ladd tumbled down into the hole
his face showed a great gray blotch and starting blood
gale felt a sickening assurance of desperate injury to the ranger
he ran to him calling laddy
laddy
shore i ain't plugged
it's a damn choya burr
the bullet knocked it in my face
pull it out
the oval longspiked cone was firmly imbedded in ladd's cheek
blood streamed down his face and neck
carefully yet with no thought of pain to himself gale tried to pull the cactus joint away
it was as firm as if it had been nailed there
that was the damnable feature of the barbed thorns  once set they held on as that strange plant held to its desert life
ladd began to writhe and sweat mingled with the blood on his face
he cursed and raved and his movements made it almost impossible for gale to do anything
put your knifeblade under an' tear it out
shouted ladd hoarsely
thus ordered gale slipped a long blade in between the imbedded thorns and with a powerful jerk literally tore the choya out of ladd's quivering flesh
then where the ranger's face was not red and raw it certainly was white
a volley of shots from a different angle was followed by the quick ring of steel bullets striking the lava all around gale
his first idea as he heard the projectiles sing and hum and whine away into the air was that they were coming from above him
he looked up to see a number of low white and dark knobs upon the high point of lava
they had not been there before
then he saw little pale leaping tongues of fire
as he dodged down he distinctly heard a bullet strike ladd
at the same instant he seemed to hear thorne cry out and fall and lash's boots scrape rapidly away
ladd fell backward still holding the 
gale dragged him into the shelter of his own position and dreading to look at him took up the heavy weapon
it was with a kind of savage strength that he gripped the rifle and it was with a cold and deadly intent that he aimed and fired
the first greaser huddled low let his carbine go clattering down and then crawled behind the rim
the second  and third jerked back
the fourth seemed to flop up over the crest of lava
a dark arm reached for him clutched his leg tried to drag him up
it was in vain
wildly grasping at the air the bandit fell slid down a steep shelf rolled over the rim to go hurtling down out of sight
fingering the hot rifle with closepressed hands gale watched the sky line along the high point of lava
it remained unbroken
as his passion left him he feared to look back at his companions and the cold chill returned to his breast
shorei'm damn gladthem greasers ain't usin' softnose bullets drawled a calm voice
swift as lightning gale whirled
laddy
i thought you were done for cried gale with a break in his voice
i ain't amindin' the bullet much
but that choya joint took my nerve an' you can gamble on it
dick this hole's pretty high up ain't it
the ranger's blouse was open at the neck and on his right shoulder under the collar bone was a small hole just beginning to bleed
sure it's high laddy replied gale gladly
went clear through clean as a whistle
he tore a handkerchief into two parts made wads and pressing them close over the wounds he bound them there with ladd's scarf
shore it's funny how a bullet can floor a man an' then not do any damage said ladd
i felt a zip of wind an' somethin' like a pat on my chest an' down i went
well so much for the small caliber with their steel bullets
supposin' i'd connected with a 
laddy ii'm afraid thorne's done for whispered gale
he's lying over there in that crack
i can see part of him
he doesn't move
i was wonderin' if i'd have to tell you that
dick he went down hard hit fallin' you know limp an' soggy
it was a moral cinch one of us would get it in this fight but god
i'm sorry thorne had to be the man
laddy maybe he's not dead replied gale
he called aloud to his friend
there was no answer
ladd got up and after peering keenly at the height of lava he strode swiftly across the space
it was only a dozen steps to the crack in the lava where thorne had fallen head first
ladd bent over went to his knees so that gale saw only his head
then he appeared rising with arms round the cavalryman
he dragged him across the hole to the sheltered corner that alone afforded protection
he had scarcely reached it when a carbine cracked and a bullet struck the flinty lava striking sparks then singing away into the air
thorne was either dead or unconscious and gale with a contracting throat and numb heart decided for the former
not so ladd who probed the bloody gash on thorne's temple and then felt his breast
he's alive an' not bad hurt
that bullet hit him glancin'
shore them steel bullets are some lucky for us
dick you needn't look so glum
i tell you he ain't bad hurt
i felt his skull with my finger
there's no hole in it
wash him off an' tie  wow
did you get the wind of that one
an' mebbe it didn't sing off the lava
dick look after thorne now while i  the completion of his speech was the stirring ring of the  and then he uttered a laugh that was unpleasant
shore greaser there's a man's size bullet for you
no slim sharppointed steeljacket nail
i'm takin' it on me to believe you're appreciatin' of the  seein' as you don't make no fuss
it was indeed a joy to gale to find that thorne had not received a wound necessarily fatal though it was serious enough
gale bathed and bound it and laid the cavalryman against the slant of the bank his head high to lessen the probability of bleeding
as gale straightened up ladd muttered low and deep and swung the heavy rifle around to the left
far along the slope a figure moved
ladd began to work the lever of the winchester and to shoot
at every shot the heavy firearm sprang up and the recoil made ladd's shoulder give back
gale saw the bullets strike the lava behind beside before the fleeing mexican sending up dull puffs of dust
on the sixth shot he plunged down out of sight either hit or frightened into seeking cover
dick mebbe there's one or two left above but we needn't figure much on it said ladd as loading the rifle he jerked his fingers quickly from the hot breech
listen
jim an' yaqui are hittin' it up lively down below
i'll sneak down there
you stay here an' keep about half an eye peeled up yonder an' keep the rest my way
ladd crossed the hole climbed down into the deep crack where thorne had fallen and then went stooping along with only his head above the level
presently he disappeared
gale having little to fear from the high ridge directed most of his attention toward the point beyond which ladd had gone
the firing had become desultory and the light carbine shots outnumbered the sharp rifle shots five to one
gale made a note of the fact that for some little time he had not heard the unmistakable report of jim lash's automatic
then ensued a long interval in which the desert silence seemed to recover its grip
the  ripped it asunderspangspangspang
gale fancied he heard yells
there were a few pattering shots still farther down the trail
gale had an uneasy conviction that rojas and some of his band might go straight to the waterhole
it would be hard to dislodge even a few men from that retreat
there seemed a lull in the battle
gale ventured to stand high and screened behind choyas he swept the threequarter circle of lava with his glass
in the distance he saw horses but no riders
below him down the slope along the crater rim and the trail the lava was bare of all except tufts of choya
gale gathered assurance
it looked as if the day was favoring his side
then thorne coming partly to consciousness engaged gale's care
the cavalryman stirred and moaned called for water and then for mercedes
gale held him back with a strong hand and presently he was once more quiet
for the first time in hours as it seemed gale took note of the physical aspect of his surroundings
he began to look upon them without keen gaze strained for crouching form or bobbing head or spouting carbine
either gale's sense of color and proportion had become deranged during the fight or the encompassing air and the desert had changed
even the sun had changed
it seemed lowering oval in shape magenta in hue and it had a surface that gleamed like oil on water
its red rays shone through red haze
distances that had formerly been clearly outlined were now dim obscured
the yawning chasm was not the same
it circled wider redder deeper
it was a weird ghastly mouth of hell
gale stood fascinated unable to tell how much he saw was real how much exaggeration of overwrought emotions
there was no beauty here but an unparalleled grandeur a sublime scene of devastation and desolation which might have had its counterpart upon the burnedout moon
the mood that gripped gale now added to its somber portent an unshakable foreboding of calamity
he wrestled with the spell as if it were a physical foe
reason and intelligence had their voices in his mind but the moment was not one wherein these things could wholly control
he felt life strong within his breast yet there a step away was death yawning glaring smoky red
it was a momentan hour for a savage born bred developed in this scarred and blasted place of jagged depths and red distances and silences never meant to be broken
since gale was not a savage he fought that call of the red gods which sent him back down the long ages toward his primitive day
his mind combated his sense of sight and the hearing that seemed useless and his mind did not win all the victory
something fatal was here hanging in the balance as the red haze hung along the vast walls of that crater of hell
suddenly harsh prolonged yells brought him to his feet and the unrealities vanished
far down the trails where the crater rims closed in the deep fissure he saw moving forms
they were three in number
two of them ran nimbly across the lava bridge
the third staggered far behind
it was ladd
he appeared hard hit
he dragged at the heavy rifle which he seemed unable to raise
the yells came from him
he was calling the yaqui
gale's heart stood still momentarily
here then was the catastrophe
he hardly dared sweep that fissure with his glass
the two fleeing figures haltedturned to fire at ladd
gale recognized the foremost onesmall compact gaudy
rojas
the bandit's arm was outstretched
puffs of white smoke rose and shots rapped out
when ladd went down rojas threw his gun aside and with a wild yell bounded over the lava
his companion followed
a tide of passion first hot as fire then cold as ice rushed over gale when he saw rojas take the trail toward mercedes's hidingplace
the little bandit appeared to have the surefootedness of a mountain sheep
the mexican following was not so sure or fast
he turned back
gale heard the trenchant bark of the 
ladd was kneeling
he shot againagain
the retreating bandit seemed to run full into an invisible obstacle then fell lax inert lifeless
rojas sped on unmindful of the spurts of dust about him
yaqui high above ladd was also firing at the bandit
then both rifles were emptied
rojas turned at a high break in the trail
he shook a defiant hand and his exulting yell pealed faintly to gale's ears
about him there was something desperate magnificent
then he clambered down the trail
ladd dropped the  and rising gun in hand he staggered toward the bridge of lava
before he had crossed it yaqui came bounding down the slope and in one splendid leap he cleared the fissure
he ran beyond the trail and disappeared on the lava above
rojas had not seen this sudden darting move of the indian
gale felt himself bitterly powerless to aid in that pursuit
he could only watch
he wondered fearfully what had become of lash
presently when rojas came out of the cracks and ruts of lava there might be a chance of disabling him by a long shot
his progress was now slow
but he was making straight for mercedes's hidingplace
what was it leading him therean eagle eye or hate or instinct
why did he go on when there could be no turning back for him on that trail
ladd was slow heavy staggering on the trail but he was relentless
only death could stop the ranger now
surely rojas must have known that when he chose the trail
from time to time gale caught glimpses of yaqui's dark figure stealing along the higher rim of the crater
he was making for a point above the bandit
momentsendless moments dragged by
the lowering sun colored only the upper half of the crater walls
far down the depths were murky blue
again gale felt the insupportable silence
the red haze became a transparent veil before his eyes
sinister evil brooding waiting seemed that yawning abyss
ladd staggered along the trail at times he crawled
the yaqui gained he might have had wings he leaped from jagged crust to jagged crust his surefootedness was a wonderful thing
but for gale the marvel of that endless period of watching was the purpose of the bandit rojas
he had now no weapon
gale's glass made this fact plain
there was death behind him death below him death before him and though he could not have known it death above him
he never falterednever made a misstep upon the narrow flinty trail
when he reached the lower end of the level ledge gale's poignant doubt became a certainty
rojas had seen mercedes
it was incredible yet gale believed it
then his heart clamped as in an icy vise gale threw forward the remington and sinking on one knee began to shoot
he emptied the magazine
puffs of dust near rojas did not even make him turn
as gale began to reload he was horrorstricken by a low cry from thorne
the cavalryman had recovered consciousness
he was half raised pointing with shaking hand at the opposite ledge
his distended eyes were riveted upon rojas
he was trying to utter speech that would not come
gale wheeled rigid now steeling himself to one last forlorn hopethat mercedes could defend herself
she had a gun
he doubted not at all that she would use it
but remembering her terror of this savage he feared for her
rojas reached the level of the ledge
he halted
he crouched
it was the act of a panther
manifestly he saw mercedes within the cave
then faint shots patted the air broke in quick echo
rojas went down as if struck a heavy blow
he was hit
but even as gale yelled in sheer madness the bandit leaped erect
he seemed too quick too supple to be badly wounded
a slight dark figure flashed out of the cave
mercedes
she backed against the wall
gale saw a puff of whiteheard a report
but the bandit lunged at her
mercedes ran not to try to pass him but straight for the precipice
her intention was plain
but rojas outstripped her even as she reached the verge
then a piercing scream pealed across the cratera scream of despair
gale closed his eyes
he could not bear to see more
thorne echoed mercedes's scream
gale looked round just in time to leap and catch the cavalryman as he staggered apparently for the steep slope
and then as gale dragged him back both fell
gale saved his friend but he plunged into a choya
he drew his hands away full of the great glistening cones of thorns
for god's sake gale shoot
shoot
kill her
kill her
can'tyouseerojas  thorne fainted
gale stunned for the instant stood with uplifted hands and gazed from thorne across the crater
rojas had not killed mercedes
he was overpowering her
his actions seemed slow wearing purposeful
hers were violent
like a trapped shewolf mercedes was fighting
she tore struggled flung herself
rojas's intention was terribly plain
in agony now both mental and physical cold and sick and weak gale gripped his rifle and aimed at the struggling forms on the ledge
he pulled the trigger
the bullet struck up a cloud of red dust close to the struggling couple
again gale fired hoping to hit rojas praying to kill mercedes
the bullet struck high
a thirdfourthfifth time the remington spokein vain
the rifle fell from gale's racked hands
how horribly plain that fiend's intention
gale tried to close his eyes but could not
he prayed wildly for a sudden blindnessto faint as thorne had fainted
but he was transfixed to the spot with eyes that pierced the red light
mercedes was growing weaker seemed about to collapse
oh jim lash are you dead
cried gale
oh laddy
oh yaqui
suddenly a dark form literally fell down the wall behind the ledge where rojas fought the girl
it sank in a heap then bounded erect
yaqui
screamed gale and he waved his bleeding hands till the blood bespattered his face
then he choked
utterance became impossible
the indian bent over rojas and flung him against the wall
mercedes sinking back lay still
when rojas got up the indian stood between him and escape from the ledge
rojas backed the other way along the narrowing shelf of lava
his manner was abject stupefied
slowly he stepped backward
it was then that gale caught the white gleam of a knife in yaqui's hand
rojas turned and ran
he rounded a corner of wall where the footing was precarious
yaqui followed slowly
his figure was dark and menacing
but he was not in a hurry
when he passed off the ledge rojas was edging farther and farther along the wall
he was clinging now to the lava creeping inch by inch
perhaps he had thought to work around the buttress or climb over it
evidently he went as far as possible and there he clung an unscalable wall above the abyss beneath
the approach of the yaqui was like a slow dark shadow of gloom
if it seemed so to the stricken gale what must it have been to rojas
he appeared to sink against the wall
the yaqui stole closer and closer
he was the savage now and for him the moment must have been glorified
gale saw him gaze up at the great circling walls of the crater then down into the depths
perhaps the red haze hanging above him or the purple haze below or the deep caverns in the lava held for yaqui spirits of the desert his gods to whom he called
perhaps he invoked shadows of his loved ones and his race calling them in this moment of vengeance
gale heardor imagined he heardthat wild strange yaqui cry
then the indian stepped close to rojas and bent low keeping out of reach
how slow were his motions
would yaqui nevernever end it
a wail drifted across the crater to gale's ears
rojas fell backward and plunged sheer
the bank of white choyas caught him held him upon their steel spikes
how long did the dazed gale sit there watching rojas wrestling and writhing in convulsive frenzy
the bandit now seemed mad to win the delayed death
when he broke free he was a white patched object no longer human a ball of choya burrs and he slipped off the bank to shoot down and down into the purple depths of the crater
xiii  changes at forlorn river  the first of march saw the federal occupation of the garrison at casita
after a short decisive engagement the rebels were dispersed into small bands and driven eastward along the boundary line toward nogales
it was the destiny of forlorn river however never to return to the slow sleepy tenor of its former existence
belding's predictions came true
that straggling line of homeseekers was but a forerunner of the real invasion of altar valley
refugees from mexico and from casita spread the word that water and wood and grass and land were to be had at forlorn river and as if by magic the white tents and red adobe houses sprang up to glisten in the sun
belding was happier than he had been for a long time
he believed that evil days for forlorn river along with the apathy and lack of enterprise were in the past
he hired a couple of trustworthy mexicans to ride the boundary line and he settled down to think of ranching and irrigation and mining projects
every morning he expected to receive some word form sonoyta or yuma telling him that yaqui had guided his party safely across the desert
belding was simpleminded a man more inclined to action than reflection
when the complexities of life hemmed him in he groped his way out never quite understanding
his wife had always been a mystery to him
nell was sunshine most of the time but like the sundominated desert she was subject to strange changes wilful stormy sudden
it was enough for belding now to find his wife in a lighter happier mood and to see nell dreamily turning a ring round and round the third finger of her left hand and watching the west
every day both mother and daughter appeared farther removed from the past darkly threatening days
belding was hearty in his affections but undemonstrative
if there was any sentiment in his makeup it had an outlet in his memory of blanco diablo and a longing to see him
often belding stopped his work to gaze out over the desert toward the west
when he thought of his rangers and thorne and mercedes he certainly never forgot his horse
he wondered if diablo was running walking resting if yaqui was finding water and grass
in march with the short desert winter over the days began to grow warm
the noon hours were hot and seemed to give promise of the white summer blaze and blasting furnace wind soon to come
no word was received from the rangers
but this caused belding no concern and it seemed to him that his women folk considered no news good news
among the many changes coming to pass in forlorn river were the installing of postoffice service and the building of a mescal drinkinghouse
belding had worked hard for the post office but he did not like the idea of a saloon for forlorn river
still that was an inevitable evil
the mexicans would have mescal
belding had kept the little border hamlet free of an establishment for distillation of the fiery cactus drink
a good many americans drifted into forlorn riverminers cowboys prospectors outlaws and others of nondescript character and these men of course made the saloon which was also an inn their headquarters
belding with carter and other old residents saw the need of a sheriff for forlorn river
one morning early in this spring month while belding was on his way from the house to the corrals he saw nell running blanco jose down the road at a gait that amazed him
she did not take the turn of the road to come in by the gate
she put jose at a fourfoot wire fence and came clattering into the yard
nell must have another tantrum said belding
she's long past due
blanco jose like the other white horses was big of frame and heavy and thunder rolled from under his great hoofs
nell pulled him up and as he pounded and slid to a halt in a cloud of dust she swung lightly down
it did not take more than half an eye for belding to see that she was furious
nell what's come off now
asked belding
i'm not going to tell you she replied and started away leading jose toward the corral
belding leisurely followed
she went into the corral removed jose's bridle and led him to the wateringtrough
belding came up and without saying anything began to unbuckle jose's saddle girths
but he ventured a look at nell
the red had gone from her face and he was surprised to see her eyes brimming with tears
most assuredly this was not one of nell's tantrums
while taking off jose's saddle and hanging it in the shed belding pondered in his slow way
when he came back to the corral nell had her face against the bars and she was crying
he slipped a big arm around her and waited
although it was not often expressed there was a strong attachment between them
dad i don't want you to think me aa baby any more she said
i've been insulted
with a specific fact to make clear thought in belding's mind he was never slow
i knew something unusual had come off
i guess you'd better tell me
dad i will if you promise
what
not to mention it to mother not to pack a gun down there and never never tell dick
belding was silent
seldom did he make promises readily
nell sure something must have come off for you to ask all that
if you don't promise i'll never tell that's all she declared firmly
belding deliberated a little longer
he knew the girl
well i promise not to tell mother he said presently and seeing you're here safe and well i guess i won't go packing a gun down there wherever that is
but i won't promise to keep anything from dick that perhaps he ought to know
dad what would dick do ifif he were here and i were to tell him i'di'd been horribly insulted
i guess that 'd depend
mostly you know dick does what you want
but you couldn't stop himnobody couldif there was reason a man's reason to get started
remember what he did to rojas
nell tell me what's happened
nell regaining her composure wiped her eyes and smoothed back her hair
the other day wednesday she began i was coming home and in front of that mescal drinkingplace there was a crowd
it was a noisy crowd
i didn't want to walk out into the street or seem afraid
but i had to do both
there were several young men and if they weren't drunk they certainly were rude
i never saw them before but i think they must belong to the mining company that was run out of sonora by rebels
mrs carter was telling me
anyway these young fellows were americans
they stretched themselves across the walk and smiled at me
i had to go out in the road
one of them the rudest followed me
he was a big fellow redfaced with prominent eyes and a bold look
he came up beside me and spoke to me
i ran home
and as i ran i heard his companions jeering
well today just now when i was riding up the valley road i came upon the same fellows
they had instruments and were surveying
remembering dick and how he always wished for an instrument to help work out his plan for irrigation i was certainly surprised to see these strangers surveyingand surveying upon laddy's plot of land
it was a sandy road there and jose happened to be walking
so i reined in and asked these engineers what they were doing
the leader who was that same bold fellow who had followed me seemed much pleased at being addressed
he was swaggeringtoo friendly not my idea of a gentleman at all
he said he was glad to tell me he was going to run water all over altar valley
dad you can bet that made me wild
that was dick's plan his discovery and here were surveyors on laddy's claim
then i told him that he was working on private land and he'd better get off
he seemed to forget his flirty proclivities in amazement
then he looked cunning
i read his mind
it was news to him that all the land along the valley had been taken up
he said something about not seeing any squatters on the land and then he shut up tight on that score
but he began to be flirty again
he got hold of jose's bridle and before i could catch my breath he said i was a peach and that he wanted to make a date with me that his name was chase that he owned a gold mine in mexico
he said a lot more i didn't gather but when he called me 'dearie' iwell i lost my temper
i jerked on the bridle and told him to let go
he held on and rolled his eyes at me
i dare say he imagined he was a gentlemen to be infatuated with
he seemed sure of conquest
one thing certain he didn't know the least bit about horses
it scared me the way he got in front of jose
i thanked my stars i wasn't up on blanco diablo
well dad i'm a little ashamed now but i was mad
i slashed him across the face with my quirt
jose jumped and knocked mr chase into the sand
i didn't get the horse under control till i was out of sight of those surveyors and then i let him run home
nell i guess you punished the fellow enough
maybe he's only a conceited softy
but i don't like that sort of thing
it isn't western
i guess he won't be so smart next time
any fellow would remember being hit by blanco jose
if you'd been up on diablo we'd have to bury mr
chase
thank goodness i wasn't
i'm sorry now dad
perhaps the fellow was hurt
but what could i do
let's forget all about it and i'll be careful where i ride in the future dad what does it mean this surveying around forlorn river
i don't know nell replied belding thoughtfully
it worries me
it looks good for forlorn river but bad for dick's plan to irrigate the valley
lord i'd hate to have some one forestall dick on that
no no we won't let anybody have dick's rights declared nell
where have i been keeping myself not to know about these surveyors
muttered belding
they must have just come
go see mrs cater
she told me there were strangers in town americans who had mining interests in sonora and were run out by orozco
find out what they're doing dad
belding discovered that he was indeed the last man of consequence in forlorn river to learn of the arrival of ben chase and son mineowners and operators in sonora
they with a force of miners had been besieged by rebels and finally driven off their property
this property was not destroyed but held for ransom
and the chases pending developments had packed outfits and struck for the border
casita had been their objective point but for some reason which belding did not learn they had arrived instead at forlorn river
it had taken ben chase just one day to see the possibilities of altar valley and in three days he had men at work
belding returned home without going to see the chases and their operations
he wanted to think over the situation
next morning he went out to the valley to see for himself
mexicans were hastily erecting adobe houses upon ladd's one hundred and sixty acres upon dick gale's upon jim lash's and thorne's
there were men staking the valley floor and the river bed
that was sufficient for belding
he turned back toward town and headed for the camp of these intruders
in fact the surroundings of forlorn river except on the river side reminded belding of the mushroom growth of a newly discovered mining camp
tents were everywhere adobe shacks were in all stages of construction rough clapboard houses were going up
the latest of this work was new and surprising to belding all because he was a busy man with no chance to hear village gossip
when he was directed to the headquarters of the chase mining company he went thither in slowgrowing wrath
he came to a big tent with a huge canvas fly stretched in front under which sat several men in their shirt sleeves
they were talking and smoking
my name's belding
i want to see this mr chase said belding gruffly
slowwitted as belding was and absorbed in his own feelings he yet saw plainly that his advent was disturbing to these men
they looked alarmed exchanged glances and then quickly turned to him
one of them a tall rugged man with sharp face and shrewd eyes and white hair got up and offered his hand
i'm chase senior he said
my son radford chase is here somewhere
you're belding the line inspector i take it
i meant to call on you
he seemed a roughandready loudspoken man withal cordial enough
yes i'm the inspector replied belding ignoring the proffered hand and i'd like to know what in the hell you mean by taking up land claimsstaked ground that belongs to my rangers
land claims
slowly echoed chase studying his man
we're taking up only unclaimed land
that's a lie
you couldn't miss the stakes
well mr belding as to that i think my men did run across some staked ground
but we recognize only squatters
if your rangers think they've got property just because they drove a few stakes in the ground they're much mistaken
a squatter has to build a house and live on his land so long according to law before he owns it
this argument was unanswerable and belding knew it
according to law
exclaimed belding
then you own up you've jumped our claims
mr belding i'm a plain business man
i come along
i see a good opening
nobody seems to have tenable grants
i stake out claims locate squatters start to build
it seems to me your rangers have overlooked certain precautions
that's unfortunate for them
i'm prepared to hold my claim and to back all the squatters who work for me
if you don't like it you can carry the matter to tucson
the law will uphold me
the law
say on this southwest border we haven't any law except a man's word and a gun
then you'll find united states law has come along with ben chase replied the other snapping his fingers
he was still smooth outspoken but his mask had fallen
you're not a westerner
queried belding
no i'm from illinois
i thought the west hadn't bred you
i know your kind
you'd last a long time on the texas border now wouldn't you
you're one of the land and water hogs that has come to root in the west
you're like the timber sharkstake it all and leave none for those who follow
mr chase the west would fare better and last longer if men like you were driven out
you can't drive me out
i'm not so sure of that
wait till my rangers come back
i wouldn't be in your boots
don't mistake me
i don't suppose you could be accused of stealing another man's ideas or plan but sure you've stolen these four claims
maybe the law might uphold you
but the spirit not the letter counts with us bordermen
see here belding i think you're taking the wrong view of the matter
i'm going to develop this valley
you'd do better to get in with me
i've a proposition to make you about that strip of land of yours facing the river
you can't make any deals with me
i won't have anything to do with you
belding abruptly left the camp and went home
nell met him probably intended to question him but one look into his face confirmed her fears
she silently turned away
belding realized he was powerless to stop chase and he was sick with disappointment for the ruin of dick's hopes and his own
xiv  a lost son  time passed
the population of forlorn river grew apace
belding who had once been the head of the community found himself a person of little consequence
even had he desired it he would not have had any voice in the selection of postmaster sheriff and a few other officials
the chases divided their labors between forlorn river and their mexican gold mine which had been restored to them
the desert trips between these two places were taken in automobiles
a month's time made the motor cars almost as familiar a sight in forlorn river as they had been in casita before the revolution
belding was not so busy as he had been formerly
as he lost ambition he began to find less work to do
his wrath at the usurping chases increased as he slowly realized his powerlessness to cope with such men
they were promoters men of big interests and wide influence in the southwest
the more they did for forlorn river the less reason there seemed to be for his own grievance
he had to admit that it was personal that he and gale and the rangers would never have been able to develop the resources of the valley as these men were doing it
all day long he heard the heavy booming blasts and the rumble of avalanches up in the gorge
chase's men were dynamiting the cliffs in the narrow box canyon
they were making the dam just as gale had planned to make it
when this work of blasting was over belding experienced a relief
he would not now be continually reminded of his and gale's loss
resignation finally came to him
but he could not reconcile himself to misfortune for gale
moreover belding had other worry and strain
april arrived with no news of the rangers
from casita came vague reports of raiders in the sonoyta countryreports impossible to verify until his mexican rangers returned
when these men rode in one of them gonzales an intelligent and reliable halfbreed said he had met prospectors at the oasis
they had just come in on the camino del diablo reported a terrible trip of heat and drought and not a trace of the yaqui's party
that settles it declared belding
yaqui never went to sonoyta
he's circled round to the devil's road and the rangers mercedes thorne the horsestheyi'm afraid they have been lost in the desert
it's an old story on camino del diablo
he had to tell nell that and it was an ordeal which left him weak
mrs belding listened to him and was silent for a long time while she held the stricken nell to her breast
then she opposed his convictions with that quiet strength so characteristic of her arguments
well then decided belding rojas headed the rangers at papago well or the tanks
tom when you are down in the mouth you use poor judgment she went on
you know only by a miracle could rojas or anybody have headed those white horses
where's your old stubborn confidence
yaqui was up on diablo
dick was up on sol
and there were the other horses
they could not have been headed or caught
miracles don't happen
all right mother it's sure good to hear you said belding
she always cheered him and now he grasped at straws
i'm not myself these days don't mistake that
tell us what you think
you always say you feel things when you really don't know them
i can say little more than what you said yourself the night mercedes was taken away
you told laddy to trust yaqui that he was a godsend
he might go south into some wild sonora valley
he might lead rojas into a trap
he would find water and grass where no mexican or american could
but mother they're gone seven weeks
seven weeks
at the most i gave them six weeks
seven weeks in the desert
how do the yaquis live
she asked
belding could not reply to that but hope revived in him
he had faith in his wife though he could not in the least understand what he imagined was something mystic in her
years ago when i was searching for my father i learned many things about this country said mrs belding
you can never tell how long a man may live in the desert
the fiercest most terrible and inaccessible places often have their hidden oasis
in his later years my father became a prospector
that was strange to me for he never cared for gold or money
i learned that he was often gone in the desert for weeks once for months
then the time came when he never came back
that was years before i reached the southwest border and heard of him
even then i did not for long give up hope of his coming back  i know nowsomething tells meindeed it seems his spirit tells mehe was lost
but i don't have that feeling for yaqui and his party
yaqui has given rojas the slip or has ambushed him in some trap
probably that took time and a long journey into sonora
the indian is too wise to start back now over dry trails
he'll curb the rangers he'll wait
i seem to know this dear nell so be brave patient
dick gale will come back to you
oh mother
cried nell
i can't give up hope while i have you
that talk with the strong mother worked a change in nell and belding
nell who had done little but brood and watch the west and take violent rides seemed to settle into a waiting patience that was sad yet serene
she helped her mother more than ever she was a comfort to belding she began to take active interest in the affairs of the growing village
belding who had been breaking under the strain of worry recovered himself so that to outward appearance he was his old self
he alone knew however that his humor was forced and that the slow burning wrath he felt for the chases was flaming into hate
belding argued with himself that if ben chase and his son radford had turned out to be big men in other ways than in the power to carry on great enterprises he might have become reconciled to them
but the father was greedy grasping hard cold the son added to those traits an overbearing disposition to rule and he showed a fondness for drink and cards
these men were developing the valley to be sure and a horde of poor mexicans and many americans were benefiting from that development nevertheless these chases were operating in a way which proved they cared only for themselves
belding shook off a lethargic spell and decided he had better set about several by no means small tasks if he wanted to get them finished before the hot months
he made a trip to the sonoyta oasis
he satisfied himself that matters along the line were favorable and that there was absolutely no trace of his rangers
upon completing this trip he went to casita with a number of his white thoroughbreds and shipped them to ranchers and horsebreeders in texas
then being near the railroad and having time he went up to tucson
there he learned some interesting particulars about the chases
they had an office in the city influential friends in the capitol
they were powerful men in the rapidly growing finance of the west
they had interested the southern pacific railroad and in the near future a branch line was to be constructed from san felipe to forlorn river
these details of the chase development were insignificant when compared to a matter striking close home to belding
his responsibility had been subtly attacked
a doubt had been cast upon his capability of executing the duties of immigration inspector to the best advantage of the state
belding divined that this was only an entering wedge
the chases were bent upon driving him out of forlorn river but perhaps to serve better their own ends they were proceeding at leisure
belding returned home consumed by rage
but he controlled it
for the first time in his life he was afraid of himself
he had his wife and nell to think of and the old law of the west had gone forever
dad there's another rojas round these diggings was nell's remark after the greetings were over and the usual questions and answers passed
belding's exclamation was cut short by nell's laugh
she was serious with a kind of amused contempt
mr radford chase
now nell what the roared belding
hush dad
don't swear interrupted nell
i only meant to tease you
humph
say my girl that name chase makes me see red
if you must tease me hit on some other way
sabe senorita
si si dad
nell you may as well tell him and have it over said mrs belding quietly
you promised me once dad that you'd not go packing a gun off down there didn't you
yes i remember replied belding but he did not answer her smile
will you promise again
she asked lightly
here was nell with arch eyes yet not the old arch eyes so full of fun and mischief
her lips were tremulous her cheeks seemed less round
yes rejoined belding and he knew why his voice was a little thick
well if you weren't such a good old blind dad you'd have seen long ago the way mr radford chase ran round after me
at first it was only annoying and i did not want to add to your worries
but these two weeks you've been gone i've been more than annoyed
after that time i struck mr chase with my quirt he made all possible efforts to meet me
he did meet me wherever i went
he sent me letters till i got tired of sending them back
when you left home on your trips i don't know that he grew bolder but he had more opportunity
i couldn't stay in the house all the time
there were mama's errands and sick people and my sunday school and what not
mr chase waylaid me every time i went out
if he works any more i don't know when unless it's when i'm asleep
he followed me until it was less embarassing for me to let him walk with me and talk his head off
he made love to me
he begged me to marry him
i told him i was already in love and engaged to be married
he said that didn't make any difference
then i called him a fool
next time he saw me he said he must explain
he meant i was being true to a man who everybody on the border knew had been lost in the desert
thatthat hurt
maybemaybe it's true
sometimes it seems terribly true
since then of course i have stayed in the house to avoid being hurt again
but dad a little thing like a girl sticking close to her mother and room doesn't stop mr chase
i think he's crazy
anyway he's a most persistent fool
i want to be charitable because the man swears he loves me and maybe he does but he is making me nervous
i don't sleep
i'm afraid to be in my room at night
i've gone to mother's room
he's always hanging round
bold
why that isn't the thing to call mr chase
he's absolutely without a sense of decency
he bribes our servants
he comes into our patio
think of that
he makes the most ridiculous excuses
he bothers mother to death
i feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound
and i daren't peep out
somehow the thing struck belding as funny and he laughed
he had not had a laugh for so long that it made him feel good
he stopped only at sight of nell's surprise and pain
then he put his arms round her
never mind dear
i'm an old bear
but it tickled me i guess
i sure hope mr radford chase has got it bad nell it's only the old story
the fellows fall in love with you
it's your good looks nell
what a price women like you and mercedes have to pay for beauty
i'd a d a good deal rather be ugly as a mud fence
so would i dad ifif dick would still love me
he wouldn't you can gamble on that as laddy says
 well the first time i catch this locoed romeo sneaking round here i'lli'll  dad you promised
confound it nell i promised not to pack a gun
that's all
i'll only shoo this fellow off the place gently mind you gently
i'll leave the rest for dick gale
oh dad
cried nell and she clung to him wistful frightened yet something more
don't mistake me nell
you have your own way generally
you pull the wool over mother's eyes and you wind me round your little finger
but you can't do either with dick gale
you're tenderhearted you overlook the doings of this hound chase
but when dick comes back you just make up your mind to a little hell in the chase camp
oh he'll find it out
and i sure want to be round when dick hands mr radford the same as he handed rojas
belding kept a sharp lookout for young chase and then a few days later learned that both son and father had gone off upon one of their frequent trips to casa grandes near where their mines were situated
april grew apace and soon gave way to may
one morning belding was called from some garden work by the whirring of an automobile and a holloa
he went forward to the front yard and there saw a car he thought resembled one he had seen in casita
it contained a familiarlooking driver but the three figures in gray coats and veils were strange to him
by the time he had gotten to the road he decided two were women and the other a man
at the moment their faces were emerging from dusty veils
belding saw an elderly sallowfaced rather frailappearing man who was an entire stranger to him a handsome darkeyed woman whose hair showed white through her veil and a superbly built girl whose face made belding at once think of dick gale
is this mr tom belding inspector of immigration
inquired the gentleman courteously
i'm belding and i know who you are replied belding in hearty amaze as he stretched forth his big hand
you're dick gale's dadthe governor dick used to say
i'm sure glad to meet you
thank you
yes i'm dick's governor and here mr beldingdick's mother and his sister elsie
beaming his pleasure belding shook hands with the ladies who showed their agitation clearly
mr belding i've come west to look up my lost son said mr gale
his sister's letters were unanswered
we haven't heard from him in months
is he still here with you
well now sure i'm awful sorry began belding his slow mind at work
dick's away just nowbeen away for a considerable spell
i'm expecting him back any day won't you come in
you're all dusty and hot and tired
come in and let mother and nell make you comfortable
of course you'll stay
we've a big house
you must stay till dick comes back
maybe that 'll be aw i guess it won't be long let me handle the baggage mr gale come in
i sure am glad to meet you all
eager excited delighted belding went on talking as he ushered the gales into the sittingroom presenting them in his hearty way to the astounded mrs belding and nell
for the space of a few moments his wife and daughter were bewildered
belding did not recollect any other occasion when a few callers had thrown them off their balance
but of course this was different
he was a little flustered himselfa circumstance that dawned upon him with surprise
when the gales had been shown to rooms mrs belding gained the poise momentarily lost but nell came rushing back wilder than a deer in a state of excitement strange even for her
oh
dick's mother his sister
whispered nell
belding observed the omission of the father in nell's exclamation of mingled delight and alarm
his mother
went on nell
oh i knew it
i always guessed it
dick's people are proud rich they're somebody
i thought i'd faint when she looked at me
she was just curiouscurious but so cold and proud
she was wondering about me
i'm wearing his ring
it was his mother's he said
i won'ti can't take it off
and i'm scared
but the sisteroh she's lovely and sweetproud too
i felt warm all over when she looked at me
ii wanted to kiss her
she looks like dick when he first came to us
but he's changed
they'll hardly recognize him to think they've come
and i had to be looking a fright when of all times on earth i'd want to look my best
nell out of breath ran away evidently to make herself presentable according to her idea of the exigency of the case
belding caught a glimpse of his wife's face as she went out and it wore a sad strange anxious expression
then belding sat alone pondering the contracting emotions of his wife and daughter
it was beyond his understanding
women were creatures of feeling
belding saw reason to be delighted to entertain dick's family and for the time being no disturbing thought entered his mind
presently the gales came back into the sittingroom looking very different without the long gray cloaks and veils
belding saw distinction and elegance
mr gale seemed a grave troubled kindly person ill in body and mind
belding received the same impression of power that ben chase had given him only here it was minus any harshness or hard quality
he gathered that mr gale was a man of authority
mrs gale rather frightened belding but he could not have told why
the girl was just like dick as he used to be
their manner of speaking also reminded belding of dick
they talked of the ride from ash fork down to the border of the ugly and tornup casita of the heat and dust and cactus along the trail
presently nell came in now cool and sweet in white with a red rose at her breast
belding had never been so proud of her
he saw that she meant to appear well in the eyes of dick's people and began to have a faint perception of what the ordeal was for her
belding imagined the sooner the gales were told that dick was to marry nell the better for all concerned and especially for nell
in the general conversation that ensued he sought for an opening in which to tell this important news but he was kept so busy answering questions about his position on the border the kind of place forlorn river was the reason for so many tents etc that he was unable to find opportunity
it's very interesting very interesting said mr gale
at another time i want to learn all you'll tell me about the west
it's new to me
i'm surprised amazed sir i may say
but mr belding what i want to know most is about my son
i'm broken in health
i've worried myself ill over him
i don't mind telling you sir that we quarreled
i laughed at his threats
he went away
and i've come to see that i didn't know richard
i was wrong to upbraid him
for a year we've known nothing of his doings and now for almost six months we've not heard from him at all
frankly mr belding i weakened first and i've come to hunt him up
my fear is that i didn't start soon enough
the boy will have a great position some daygod knows perhaps soon
i should not have allowed him to run over this wild country for so long
but i hoped though i hardly believed that he might find himself
now i'm afraid he's  mr gale paused and the white hand he raised expressively shook a little
belding was not so thickwitted where men were concerned
he saw how the matter lay between dick gale and his father
well mr gale sure most young bucks from the east go to the bad out here he said bluntly
i've been told that replied mr gale and a shade overspread his worn face
they blow their money then go punching cows take to whiskey
yes rejoined mr gale feebly nodding
then they get to gambling lose their jobs went on belding
mr gale lifted haggard eyes
then it's bumming around regular tramps and to the bad generally
belding spread wide his big arms and when one of them dropped round nell who sat beside him she squeezed his hand tight
sure it's the regular thing he concluded cheerfully
he rather felt a little glee at mr gale's distress and mrs gale's crushed itoldyouso woe in no wise bothered him but the look in the big dark eyes of dick's sister was too much for belding
he choked off his characteristic oath when excited and blurted out say but dick gale never went to the bad
listen
belding had scarcely started dick gale's story when he perceived that never in his life had he such an absorbed and breathless audience
presently they were awed and at the conclusion of that story they sat whitefaced still amazed beyond speech
dick gale's advent in casita his rescue of mercedes his life as a border ranger certainly lost no picturesque or daring or even noble detail in belding's telling
he kept back nothing but the present doubt of dick's safety
dick's sister was the first of the three to recover herself
oh father
she cried and there was a glorious light in her eyes
deep down in my heart i knew dick was a man
mr gale rose unsteadily from his chair
his frailty was now painfully manifest
mr belding do you mean my sonrichard galehas done all that you told us
he asked incredulously
i sure do replied belding with hearty good will
martha do you hear
mr gale turned to question his wife
she could not answer
her face had not yet regained its natural color
he faced that bandit and his gang alonehe fought them
demanded mr gale his voice stronger
dick mopped up the floor with the whole outfit
he rescued a spanish girl went into the desert without food weapons anything but his hands
richard gale whose hands were always useless
belding nodded with a grin
he's a ranger nowriding fighting sleeping on the sand preparing his own food
well i should smile rejoined belding
he cares for his horse with his own hands
this query seemed to be the climax of mr gale's strange hunger for truth
he had raised his head a little higher and his eye was brighter
mention of a horse fired belding's blood
does dick gale care for his horse
say there are not many men as well loved as that white horse of dick's
blanco sol he is mr gale
that's mex for white sun
wait till you see blanco sol
bar one the whitest biggest strongest fastest grandest horse in the southwest
so he loves a horse
i shall not know my own son mr belding you say richard works for you
may i ask at what salary
he gets forty dollars board and outfit replied belding proudly
forty dollars
echoed the father
by the day or week
the month of course said belding somewhat taken aback
forty dollars a month for a young man who spent five hundred in the same time when he was at college and who ran it into thousands when he got out
mr gale laughed for the first time and it was the laugh of a man who wanted to believe what he heard yet scarcely dared to do it
what does he do with so much moneymoney earned by peril toil sweat and blood
forty dollars a month
he saves it replied belding
evidently this was too much for dick gale's father and he gazed at his wife in sheer speechless astonishment
dick's sister clapped her hands like a little child
belding saw that the moment was propitious
sure he saves it
dick's engaged to marry nell here
my stepdaughter nell burton
ohh dad
faltered nell and she rose white as her dress
how strange it was to see dick's mother and sister rise also and turn to nell with dark proud searching eyes
belding vaguely realized some blunder he had made
nell's white appealing face gave him a pang
what had he done
surely this family of dick's ought to know his relation to nell
there was a silence that positively made belding nervous
then elsie gale stepped close to nell
miss burton are you really richard's betrothed
nell's tremulous lips framed an affirmative but never uttered it
she held out her hand showing the ring dick had given her
miss gale's recognition was instant and her response was warm sweet gracious
i think i am going to be very very glad she said and kissed nell
miss burton we are learning wonderful things about richard added mr gale in an earnest though shaken voice
if you have had to do with making a man of himand now i begin to see to believe somay god bless you
my dear girl i have not really looked at you
richard's fiancee
mother we have not found him yet but i think we've found his secret
we believed him a lost son
but here is his sweetheart
it was only then that the pride and hauteur of mrs gale's face broke into an expression of mingled pain and joy
she opened her arms
nell uttering a strange little stifled cry flew into them
belding suddenly discovered an unaccountable blur in his sight
he could not see perfectly and that was why when mrs belding entered the sittingroom he was not certain that her face was as sad and white as it seemed
xv  bound in the desert  far away from forlorn river dick gale sat stunned gazing down into the purple depths where rojas had plunged to his death
the yaqui stood motionless upon the steep red wall of lava from which he had cut the bandit's hold
mercedes lay quietly where she had fallen
from across the depths there came to gale's ear the indian's strange wild cry
then silence hollow breathless stony silence enveloped the great abyss and its upheaved lava walls
the sun was setting
every instant the haze reddened and thickened
action on the part of the yaqui loosened the spell which held gale as motionless as his surroundings
the indian was edging back toward the ledge
he did not move with his former lithe and sure freedom
he crawled slipped dragged himself rested often and went on again
he had been wounded
when at last he reached the ledge where mercedes lay gale jumped to his feet strong and thrilling spurred to meet the responsibility that now rested upon him
swiftly he turned to where thorne lay
the cavalryman was just returning to consciousness
gale ran for a canteen bathed his face made him drink
the look in thorne's eyes was hard to bear
thorne
thorne
it's all right it's all right
cried gale in piercing tones
mercedes is safe
yaqui saved her
rojas is done for
yaqui jumped down the wall and drove the bandit off the ledge
cut him loose from the wall foot by foot hand by hand
we've won the fight thorne
for thorne these were marvelous strengthgiving words
the dark horror left his eyes and they began to dilate to shine
he stood up dizzily but unaided and he gazed across the crater
yaqui had reached the side of mercedes was bending over her
she stirred
yaqui lifted her to her feet
she appeared weak unable to stand alone
but she faced across the crater and waved her hand
she was unharmed
thorne lifted both arms above head and from his lips issued a cry
it was neither call nor holloa nor welcome nor answer
like the yaqui's it could scarcely be named
but it was deep husky prolonged terribly human in its intensity
it made gale shudder and made his heart beat like a trip hammer
mercedes again waved a white hand
the yaqui waved too and gale saw in the action an urgent signal
hastily taking up canteen and rifles gale put a supporting arm around thorne
come old man
can you walk
sure you can walk
lean on me and we'll soon get out of this
don't look across
look where you step
we've not much time before dark
oh thorne i'm afraid jim has cashed in
and the last i saw of laddy he was badly hurt
gale was keyed up to a high pitch of excitement and alertness
he seemed to be able to do many things
but once off the ragged notched lava into the trail he had not such difficulty with thorne and could keep his keen gaze shifting everywhere for sight of enemies
listen thorne
what's that
asked gale halting as they came to a place where the trail led down through rough breaks in the lava
the silence was broken by a strange sound almost unbelieveable considering the time and place
a voice was droning turn the lady turn
turn the lady turn
alamon left
all swing turn the lady turn
hello jim called gale dragging thorne round the corner of lava
where are you
oh you son of a gun
i thought you were dead
oh i'm glad to see you
jim are you hurt
jim lash stood in the trail leaning over the butt of his rifle which evidently he was utilizing as a crutch
he was pale but smiling
his hands were bloody
a scarf had been bound tightly round his left leg just above the knee
the leg hung limp and the foot dragged
i reckon i ain't injured much replied him
but my leg hurts like hell if you want to know
laddy
oh where's laddy
he's just across the crack there
i was trying to get to him
we had it hot an' heavy down here
laddy was pretty bad shot up before he tried to head rojas off the trail dick did you see the yaqui go after rojas
did i
exclaimed gale grimly
the finish was all that saved me from runnin' loco plumb over the rim
you see i was closer'n you to where mercedes was hid
when rojas an' his last greaser started across laddy went after them but i couldn't
laddy did for rojas's man then went down himself
but he got up an' fell got up went on an' fell again
laddy kept doin' that till he dropped for good
i reckon our chances are against findin' him alive
i tell you boys rojas was hellbent
an' mercedes was game
i saw her shoot him
but mebbe bullets couldn't stop him then
if i didn't sweat blood when mercedes was fightin' him on the cliff
then the finish
only a yaqui could have done that thorne you didn't miss it
yes i was down and out replied the cavalryman
it's a shame
greatest stunt i ever seen
thorne you're standin' up pretty fair
how about you
dick is he bad hurt
no he's not
a hard knock on the skull and a scalp wound replied dick
here jim let me help you over this place
step by step gale got the two injured men down the uneven declivity and then across the narrow lava bridge over the fissure
here he bade them rest while he went along the trail on that side to search for laddy
gale found the ranger stretched out face downward a reddened hand clutching a gun
gale thought he was dead
upon examination however it was found that ladd still lived though he had many wounds
gale lifted him and carried him back to the others
he's alive but that's all said dick as he laid the ranger down
do what you can
stop the blood
laddy's tough as cactus you know
i'll hurry back for mercedes and yaqui
gale like a fleet surefooted mountain sheep ran along the trail
when he came across the mexican rojas's last ally gale had evidence of the terrible execution of the 
he did not pause
on the first part of that descent he made faster time than had rojas
but he exercised care along the hard slippery ragged slope leading to the ledge
presently he came upon mercedes and the yaqui
she ran right into dick's arms and there her strength if not her courage broke and she grew lax
mercedes you're safe
thorne's safe
it's all right now
rojas
she whispered
gone
to the bottom of the crater
a yaqui's vengeance mercedes
he heard the girl whisper the name of the virgin
then he gathered her up in his arms
come yaqui
the indian grunted
he had one hand pressed close over a bloody place in his shoulder
gale looked keenly at him
yaqui was inscrutable as of old yet gale somehow knew that wound meant little to him
the indian followed him
without pausing moving slowly in some places very carefully in others and swiftly on the smooth part of the trail gale carried mercedes up to the rim and along to the the others
jim lash worked awkwardly over ladd
thorne was trying to assist
ladd himself was conscious but he was a pallid apparently a deathstricken man
the greeting between mercedes and thorne was calmstrangely so it seemed to gale
but he was calm himself
ladd smiled at him and evidently would have spoken had he the power
yaqui then joined the group and his piercing eyes roved from one to the other lingering longest over ladd
dick i'm figger'n hard said jim faintly
in a minute it 'll be up to you an' mercedes
i've about shot my bolt reckon you'll do best by bringin' up blanketswatersaltfirewood
laddy's gotone chancein a hundred
fix him upfirst
use hot salt water
if my leg's brokeset it best you can
that hole in yaquionly 'll bother him a day
thorne's bad hurt now rustledick oldboy
lash's voice died away in a husky whisper and he quietly lay back stretching out all but the crippled leg
gale examined it assured himself the bones had not been broken and then rose ready to go down the trail
mercedes hold thorne's head up in your lapso
now i'll go
on the moment yaqui appeared to have completed the binding of his wounded shoulder and he started to follow gale
he paid no attention to gale's order for him to stay back
but he was slow and gradually gale forged ahead
the lingering brightness of the sunset lightened the trail and the descent to the arroyo was swift and easy
some of the white horses had come in for water
blanco sol spied gale and whistled and came pounding toward him
it was twilight down in the arroyo
yaqui appeared and began collecting a bundle of mesquite sticks
gale hastily put together the things he needed and packing them all in a tarpaulin he turned to retrace his steps up the trail
darkness was setting in
the trail was narrow exceedingly steep and in some places fronted on precipices
gale's burden was not very heavy but its bulk made it unwieldy and it was always overbalancing him or knocking against the wall side of the trail
gale found it necessary to wait for yaqui to take the lead
the indian's eyes must have seen as well at night as by day
gale toiled upward shouldering swinging dragging the big pack and though the ascent of the slope was not really long it seemed endless
at last they reached a level and were soon on the spot with mercedes and the injured men
gale then set to work
yaqui's part was to keep the fire blazing and the water hot mercedes's to help gale in what way she could
gale found ladd had many wounds yet not one of them was directly in a vital place
evidently the ranger had almost bled to death
he remained unconscious through gale's operations
according to jim lash ladd had one chance in a hundred but gale considered it one in a thousand
having done all that was possible for the ranger gale slipped blankets under and around him and then turned his attention to lash
jim came out of his stupor
a mushrooming bullet had torn a great hole in his leg
gale upon examination could not be sure the bones had been missed but there was no bad break
the application of hot salt water made jim groan
when he had been bandaged and laid beside ladd gale went on to the cavalryman
thorne was very weak and scarcely conscious
a furrow had been plowed through his scalp down to the bone
when it had been dressed mercedes collapsed
gale laid her with the three in a row and covered them with blankets and the tarpaulin
then yaqui submitted to examination
a bullet had gone through the indian's shoulder
to gale it appeared serious
yaqui said it was a flea bite
but he allowed gale to bandage it and obeyed when he was told to lie quiet in his blanket beside the fire
gale stood guard
he seemed still calm and wondered at what he considered a strange absence of poignant feeling
if he had felt weariness it was now gone
he coaxed the fire with as little wood as would keep it burning he sat beside it he walked to and fro close by sometimes he stood over the five sleepers wondering if two of them at least would ever awaken
time had passed swiftly but as the necessity for immediate action had gone by the hours gradually assumed something of their normal length
the night wore on
the air grew colder the stars brighter the sky bluer and if such could be possible the silence more intense
the fire burned out and for lack of wood could not be rekindled
gale patrolled his short beat becoming colder and damper as dawn approached
the darkness grew so dense that he could not see the pale faces of the sleepers
he dreaded the gray dawn and the light
slowly the heavy black belt close to the lava changed to a pale gloom then to gray and after that morning came quickly
the hour had come for dick gale to face his great problem
it was natural that he hung back a little at first natural that when he went forward to look at the quiet sleepers he did so with a grim and stern force urging him
yaqui stirred roused yawned got up and though he did not smile at gale a light shone swiftly across his dark face
his shoulder drooped and appeared stiff otherwise he was himself
mercedes lay in deep slumber
thorne had a high fever and was beginning to show signs of restlessness
ladd seemed just barely alive
jim lash slept as if he was not much the worse for his wound
gale rose from his examination with a sharp breaking of his cold mood
while there was life in thorne and ladd there was hope for them
then he faced his problem and his decision was instant
he awoke mercedes
how wondering wistful beautiful was that first opening flash of her eyes
then the dark troubled thought came
swiftly she sat up
mercedescome
are you all right
laddy is alive thorne's notnot so bad
but we've got a job on our hands
you must help me
she bent over thorne and laid her hands on his hot face
then she rosea woman such as he had imagined she might be in an hour of trial
gale took up ladd as carefully and gently as possible
mercedes bring what you can carry and follow me he said
then motioning for yaqui to remain there he turned down the slope with ladd in his arms
neither pausing nor making a misstep nor conscious of great effort gale carried the wounded man down into the arroyo
mercedes kept at his heels light supple lithe as a panther
he left her with ladd and went back
when he had started off with thorne in his arms he felt the tax on his strength
surely and swiftly however he bore the cavalryman down the trail to lay him beside ladd
again he started back and when he began to mount the steep lava steps he was hot wet breathing hard
as he reached the scene of that night's camp a voice greeted him
jim lash was sitting up
hello dick
i woke some late this mornin'
where's laddy
dick you ain't agoin' to say  laddy's alivethat's about all replied dick
where's thorne an' mercedes
look here man
i reckon you ain't packin' this crippled outfit down that awful trail
had to jim
an hour's sunwould killboth laddy and thorne
come on now
for once jim lash's cool good nature and careless indifference gave precedence to amaze and concern
always knew you was a husky chap
but dick you're no hoss
get me a crutch an' give me a lift on one side
come on replied gale
i've no time to monkey
he lifted the ranger called to yaqui to follow with some of the camp outfit and once more essayed the steep descent
jim lash was the heaviest man of the three and gale's strength was put to enormous strain to carry him on that broken trail
nevertheless gale went down down walking swiftly and surely over the bad places and at last he staggered into the arroyo with bursting heart and redblinded eyes
when he had recovered he made a final trip up the slope for the camp effects which yaqui had been unable to carry
then he drew jim and mercedes and yaqui also into an earnest discussion of ways and means whereby to fight for the life of thorne
ladd's case gale now considered hopeless though he meant to fight for him too as long as he breathed
in the labor of watching and nursing it seemed to gale that two days and two nights slipped by like a few hours
during that time the indian recovered from his injury and became capable of performing all except heavy tasks
then gale succumbed to weariness
after his muchneeded rest he relieved mercedes of the care and watch over thorne which up to that time she had absolutely refused to relinquish
the cavalryman had high fever and gale feared he had developed blood poisoning
he required constant attention
his condition slowly grew worse and there came a day which gale thought surely was the end
but that day passed and the night and the next day and thorne lived on ghastly stricken raving
mercedes hung over him with jealous passionate care and did all that could have been humanly done for a man
she grew wan absorbed silent
but suddenly and to gale's amaze and thanksgiving there came an abatement of thorne's fever
with it some of the heat and redness of the inflamed wound disappeared
next morning he was conscious and gale grasped some of the hope that mercedes had never abandoned
he forced her to rest while he attended to thorne
that day he saw that the crisis was past
recovery for thorne was now possible and would perhaps depend entirely upon the care he received
jim lash's wound healed without any aggravating symptoms
it would be only a matter of time until he had the use of his leg again
all these days however there was little apparent change in ladd's condition unless it was that he seemed to fade away as he lingered
at first his wounds remained open they bled a little all the time outwardly perhaps internally also the blood did not seem to clot and so the bullet holes did not close
then yaqui asked for the care of ladd
gale yielded it with opposing thoughtsthat ladd would waste slowly away till life ceased and that there never was any telling what might lie in the power of this strange indian
yaqui absented himself from camp for a while and when he returned he carried the roots and leaves of desert plants unknown to gale
from these the indian brewed an ointment
then he stripped the bandages from ladd and applied the mixture to his wounds
that done he let him lie with the wounds exposed to the air at night covering him
next day he again exposed the wounds to the warm dry air
slowly they closed and ladd ceased to bleed externally
days passed and grew into what gale imagined must have been weeks
yaqui recovered fully
jim lash began to move about on a crutch he shared the indian's watch over ladd
thorne lay haggard emaciated ghost of his rugged self but with life in the eyes that turned always toward mercedes
ladd lingered and lingered
the life seemingly would not leave his bulletpierced body
he faded withered shrunk till he was almost a skeleton
he knew those who worked and watched over him but he had no power of speech
his eyes and eyelids moved the rest of him seemed stone
all those days nothing except water was given him
it was marvelous how tenaciously however feebly he clung to life
gale imagined it was the yaqui's spirit that held back death
that tireless implacable inscrutable savage was ever at the ranger's side
his great somber eyes burned
at length he went to gale and with that strange light flitting across the hard bronzed face he said ladd would live
the second day after ladd had been given such thin nourishment as he could swallow he recovered the use of his tongue
shorethis'shell he whispered
that was a characteristic speech for the ranger gale thought and indeed it made all who heard it smile while their eyes were wet
from that time forward ladd gained but he gained so immeasurably slowly that only the eyes of hope could have seen any improvement
jim lash threw away his crutch and thorne was well if still somewhat weak before ladd could lift his arm or turn his head
a kind of long immovable gloom passed like a shadow from his face
his whispers grew stronger
and the day arrived when gale who was perhaps the least optimistic threw doubt to the winds and knew the ranger would get well
for gale that joyous moment of realization was one in which he seemed to return to a former self long absent
he experienced an elevation of soul
he was suddenly overwhelmed with gratefulness humility awe
a gloomy black terror had passed by
he wanted to thank the faithful mercedes and thorne for getting well and the cheerful lash and ladd himself and that strange and wonderful yaqui now such a splendid figure
he thought of home and nell
the terrible encompassing red slopes lost something of their fearsomeness and there was a good spirit hovering near
boys come round called ladd in his low voice
an' you mercedes
an' call the yaqui
ladd lay in the shade of the brush shelter that had been erected
his head was raised slightly on a pillow
there seemed little of him but long lean lines and if it had not been for his keen thoughtful kindly eyes his face would have resembled a death mask of a man starved
shore i want to know what day is it an' what month
asked ladd
nobody could answer him
the question seemed a surprise to gale and evidently was so to the others
look at that cactus went on ladd
near the wall of lava a stunted saguaro lifted its head
a few shriveled blossoms that had once been white hung along the fluted column
i reckon according to that giant cactus it's somewheres along the end of march said jim lash soberly
shore it's april
look where the sun is
an' can't you feel it's gettin' hot
supposin' it is april
queried lash slowly
well what i'm drivin' at is it's about time you all was hittin' the trail back to forlorn river before the waterholes dry out
laddy i reckon we'll start soon as you're able to be put on a hoss
shore that 'll be too late
a silence ensued in which those who heard ladd gazed fixedly at him and then at one another
lash uneasily shifted the position of his lame leg and gale saw him moisten his lips with his tongue
charlie ladd i ain't reckonin' you mean we're to ride off an' leave you here
what else is there to do
the hot weather's close
pretty soon most of the waterholes will be dry
you can't travel then
i'm on my back here an' god only knows when i could be packed out
not for weeks mebbe
i'll never be any good again even if i was to get out alive you see shore this sort of case comes round sometimes in the desert
it's common enough
i've heard of several cases where men had to go an' leave a feller behind
it's reasonable
if you're fightin' the desert you can't afford to be sentimental now as i said i'm all in
so what's the sense of you waitin' here when it means the old desert story
by goin' now mebbe you'll get home
if you wait on a chance of takin' me you'll be too late
pretty soon this lava 'll be one roastin' hell
shore now boys you'll see this the right way
jim old pard
no laddy an' i can't figger how you could ever ask me
shore then leave me here with yaqui an' a couple of the hosses
we can eat sheep meat
an' if the water holds out  no
interrupted lash violently
ladd's eyes sought gale's face
son you ain't bullheaded like jim
you'll see the sense of it
there's nell awaitin' back at forlorn river
think what it means to her
she's a damn fine girl dick an' what right have you to break her heart for an old wornout cowpuncher
think how she's watchin' for you with that sweet face all sad an' troubled an' her eyes turnin' black
you'll go son won't you
dick shook his head
the ranger turned his gaze upon thorne and now the keen glistening light in his gray eyes had blurred
thorne it's different with you
jim's a fool an' young gale has been punctured by choya thorns
he's got the desert poison in his blood
but you nowyou've no call to stickyou can find that trail out
it's easy to follow made by so many shod hosses
take your wife an' go
shore you'll go thorne
deliberately and without an instant's hesitation the cavalryman replied no
ladd then directed his appeal to mercedes
his face was now convulsed and his voice though it had sunk to a whisper was clear and beautiful with some rich quality that gale had never heard in it
mercedes you're a woman
you're the woman we fought for
an' some of us are shore goin' to die for you
don't make it all for nothin'
let us feel we saved the woman
shore you can make thorne go
he'll have to go if you say
they'll all have to go
think of the years of love an' happiness in store for you
a week or so an' it 'll be too late
can you stand for me seein' you
let me tell you mercedes when the summer heat hits the lava we'll all wither an' curl up like shavin's near a fire
a wind of hell will blow up this slope
look at them mesquites
see the twist in them
that's the torture of heat an' thirst
do you want me or all us men seein' you like that
mercedes don't make it all for nothin'
say you'll persuade thorne if not the others
for all the effect his appeal had to move her mercedes might have possessed a heart as hard and fixed as the surrounding lava
never
whitefaced with great black eyes flashing the spanish girl spoke the word that bound her and her companions in the desert
the subject was never mentioned again
gale thought that he read a sinister purpose in ladd's mind
to his astonishment lash came to him with the same fancy
after that they made certain there never was a gun within reach of ladd's clutching clawlike hands
gradually a somber spell lifted from the ranger's mind
when he was entirely free of it he began to gather strength daily
then it was as if he had never known patiencehe who had shown so well how to wait
he was in a frenzy to get well
he appetite could not be satisfied
the sun climbed higher whiter hotter
at midday a wind from gulfward roared up the arroyo and now only palos verdes and the few saguaros were green
every day the water in the lava hole sank an inch
the yaqui alone spent the waiting time in activity
he made trips up on the lava slope and each time he returned with guns or boots or sombreros or something belonging to the bandits that had fallen
he never fetched in a saddle or bridle and from that the rangers concluded rojas's horses had long before taken their back trail
what speculation what consternation those saddled horses would cause if they returned to forlorn river
as ladd improved there was one story he had to hear every day
it was the one relating to what he had missedthe sight of rojas pursued and plunged to his doom
the thing had a morbid fascination for the sick ranger
he reveled in it
he tortured mercedes
his gentleness and consideration heretofore so marked were in abeyance to some sinister ghastly joy
but to humor him mercedes racked her soul with the sensations she had suffered when rojas hounded her out on the ledge when she shot him when she sprang to throw herself over the precipice when she fought him when with halfblinded eyes she looked up to see the merciless yaqui reaching for the bandit
ladd fed his cruel longing with thorne's poignant recollections with the keen clear nevertobeforgotten shocks to gale's eye and ear
jim lash for one at least never tired of telling how he had seen and heard the tragedy and every time in the telling it gathered some more tragic and gruesome detail
jim believed in satiating the ranger
then in the twilight when the campfire burned ladd would try to get the yaqui to tell his side of the story
but this the indian would never do
there was only the expression of his fathomless eyes and the set passion of his massive face
those waiting days grew into weeks
ladd gained very slowly
nevertheless at last he could walk about and soon he averred that strapped to a horse he could last out the trip to forlorn river
there was rejoicing in camp and plans were eagerly suggested
the yaqui happened to be absent
when he returned the rangers told him they were now ready to undertake the journey back across lava and cactus
yaqui shook his head
they declared again their intention
no
replied the indian and his deep sonorous voice rolled out upon the quiet of the arroyo
he spoke briefly then
they had waited too long
the smaller waterholes back in the trail were dry
the hot summer was upon them
there could be only death waiting down in the burning valley
here was water and grass and wood and shade from the sun's rays and sheep to be killed on the peaks
the water would hold unless the season was that dreaded ano seco of the mexicans
wait for rain concluded yaqui and now as never before he spoke as one with authority
if no rain  silently he lifted his hand
xvi  mountain sheep  what gale might have thought an appalling situation if considered from a safe and comfortable home away from the desert became now that he was shut in by the redribbed lava walls and great dry wastes a matter calmly accepted as inevitable
so he imagined it was accepted by the others
not even mercedes uttered a regret
no word was spoken of home
if there was thought of loved one it was locked deep in their minds
in mercedes there was no change in womanly quality perhaps because all she had to love was there in the desert with her
gale had often pondered over this singular change in character
he had trained himself in order to fight a paralyzing something in the desert's influence to oppose with memory and thought an insidious primitive retrogression to what was scarcely consciousness at all merely a savage's instinct of sight and sound
he felt the need now of redoubled effort
for there was a sheer happiness in drifting
not only was it easy to forget it was hard to remember
his idea was that a man laboring under a great wrong a great crime a great passion might find the lonely desert a fitting place for either remembrance or oblivion according to the nature of his soul
but an ordinary healthy reasonably happy mortal who loved the open with its blaze of sun and sweep of wind would have a task to keep from going backward to the natural man as he was before civilization
by tacit agreement ladd again became the leader of the party
ladd was a man who would have taken all the responsibility whether or not it was given him
in moments of hazard of uncertainty lash and gale even belding unconsciously looked to the ranger
he had that kind of power
the first thing ladd asked was to have the store of food that remained spread out upon a tarpaulin
assuredly it was a slender enough supply
the ranger stood for long moments gazing down at it
he was groping among past experiences calling back from his years of life on range and desert that which might be valuable for the present issue
it was impossible to read the gravity of ladd's face for he still looked like a dead man but the slow shake of his head told gale much
there was a grain of hope however in the significance with which he touched the bags of salt and said shore it was sense packin' all that salt
then he turned to face his comrades
that's little grub for six starvin' people corralled in the desert
but the grub end ain't worryin' me
yaqui can get sheep up the slopes
water
that's the beginnin' and middle an' end of our case
laddy i reckon the waterhole here never goes dry replied jim
ask the indian
upon being questioned yaqui repeated what he had said about the dreaded ano seco of the mexicans
in a dry year this waterhole failed
dick take a rope an' see how much water's in the hole
gale could not find bottom with a thirty foot lasso
the water was as cool clear sweet as if it had been kept in a shaded iron receptacle
ladd welcomed this information with surprise and gladness
let's see
last year was shore pretty dry
mebbe this summer won't be
mebbe our wonderful good luck'll hold
ask yaqui if he thinks it 'll rain
mercedes questioned the indian
he says no man can tell surely
but he thinks the rain will come she replied
shore it 'll rain you can gamble on that now continued ladd
if there's only grass for the hosses
we can't get out of here without hosses
dick take the indian an' scout down the arroyo
today i seen the hosses were gettin' fat
gettin' fat in this desert
but mebbe they've about grazed up all the grass
go an' see dick
an' may you come back with more good news
gale upon the few occasions when he had wandered down the arroyo had never gone far
the yaqui said there was grass for the horses and until now no one had given the question more consideration
gale found that the arroyo widened as it opened
near the head where it was narrow the grass lined the course of the dry stream bed
but farther down this stream bed spread out
there was every indication that at flood seasons the water covered the floor of the arroyo
the farther gale went the thicker and larger grew the gnarled mesquites and palo verdes the more cactus and greasewood there were and other desert growths
patches of gray grass grew everywhere
gale began to wonder where the horses were
finally the trees and brush thinned out and a milewide gray plain stretched down to reddish sand dunes
over to one side were the white horses and even as gale saw them both blanco diablo and sol lifted their heads and with white manes tossing in the wind whistled clarion calls
here was grass enough for many horses the arroyo was indeed an oasis
ladd and the others were awaiting gale's report and they received it with calmness yet with a joy no less evident because it was restrained
gale in his keen observation at the moment found that he and his comrades turned with glad eyes to the woman of the party
senor laddy you thinkyou believewe shall she faltered and her voice failed
it was the woman in her weakening in the light of real hope of the happiness now possible beyond that desert barrier
mercedes no white man can tell what'll come to pass out here said ladd earnestly
shore i have hopes now i never dreamed of
i was pretty near a dead man
the indian saved me
queer notions have come into my head about yaqui
i don't understand them
he seems when you look at him only a squalid sullen vengeful savage
but lord
that's far from the truth
mebbe yaqui's different from most indians
he looks the same though
mebbe the trouble is we white folks never knew the indian
anyway beldin' had it right
yaqui's our godsend
now as to the future i'd like to know mebbe as well as you if we're ever to get home
only bein' what i am i say quien sabe
but somethin' tells me yaqui knows
ask him mercedes
make him tell
we'll all be the better for knowin'
we'd be stronger for havin' more'n our faith in him
he's silent indian but make him tell
mercedes called to yaqui
at her bidding there was always a suggestion of hurry which otherwise was never manifest in his actions
she put a hand on his bared muscular arm and began to speak in spanish
her voice was low swift full of deep emotion sweet as the sound of a bell
it thrilled gale though he understood scarcely a word she said
he did not need translation to know that here spoke the longing of a woman for life love home the heritage of a woman's heart
gale doubted his own divining impression
it was that the yaqui understood this woman's longing
in gale's sight the indian's stoicism his inscrutability the lavalike hardness of his face although they did not change seemed to give forth light gentleness loyalty
for an instant gale seemed to have a vision but it did not last and he failed to hold some beautiful illusive thing
si
rolled out the indian's reply full of power and depth
mercedes drew a long breath and her hand sought thorne's
he says yes she whispered
he answers he'll save us he'll take us all backhe knows
the indian turned away to his tasks and the silence that held the little group was finally broken by ladd
shore i said so
now all we've got to do is use sense
friends i'm the commissary department of this outfit an' what i say goes
you all won't eat except when i tell you
mebbe it'll not be so hard to keep our health
starved beggars don't get sick
but there's the heat comin' an' we can all go loco you know
to pass the time
lord that's our problem
now if you all only had a hankerin' for checkers
shore i'll make a board an' make you play
thorne you're the luckiest
you've got your girl an' this can be a honeymoon
now with a few tools an' little material see what a grand house you can build for your wife
dick you're lucky too
you like to hunt an' up there you'll find the finest bighorn huntin' in the west
take yaqui and the 
we need the meat but while you're gettin' it have your sport
the same chance will never come again
i wish we all was able to go
but crippled men can't climb the lava
shore you'll see some country from the peaks
there's no wilder place on earth except the poles
an' when you're older you an' nell with a couple of fine boys think what it'll be to tell them about bein' lost in the lava an' huntin' sheep with a yaqui
shore i've hit it
you can take yours out in huntin' an' thinkin'
now if i had a girl like nell i'd never go crazy
that's your game dick
hunt an' think of nell an' how you'll tell those fine boys about it all an' about the old cowman you knowed laddy who'll by then be long past the divide
rustle now son
get some enthusiasm
for shore you'll need it for yourself an' us
gale climbed the lava slope away round to the right of the arroyo along an old trail that yaqui said the papagos had made before his own people had hunted there
part way it led through spiked crested upheaved lava that would have been almost impassable even without its silver coating of choya cactus
there were benches and ledges and ridges bare and glistening in the sun
from the crests of these yaqui's searching falcon gaze roved near and far for signs of sheep and gale used his glass on the reaches of lava that slanted steeply upward to the corrugated peaks and down over endless heave and roll and redwaved slopes
the heat smoked up from the lava and this with the red color and the shiny choyas gave the impression of a world of smoldering fire
farther along the slope yaqui halted and crawled behind projections to a point commanding a view over an extraordinary section of country
the peaks were off to the left
in the foreground were gullies ridges and canyons arroyos all glistening with choyas and some other and more numerous white bushes and here and there towered a green cactus
this region was only a splintered and more devastated part of the volcanic slope but it was miles in extent
yaqui peeped over the top of a blunt block of lava and searched the sharpbillowed wilderness
suddenly he grasped gale and pointed across a deep wide gully
with the aid of his glass gale saw five sheep
they were much larger than he had expected dull brown in color and two of them were rams with great curved horns
they were looking in his direction
remembering what he had heard about the wonderful eyesight of these mountain animals gale could only conclude that they had seen the hunters
then yaqui's movements attracted and interested him
the indian had brought with him a red scarf and a mesquite branch
he tied the scarf to the stick and propped this up in a crack of the lava
the scarf waved in the wind
that done the indian bade gale watch
once again he leveled the glass at the sheep
all five were motionless standing like statues heads pointed across the gully
they were more than a mile distant
when gale looked without his glass they merged into the roughness of the lava
he was intensely interested
did the sheep see the red scarf
it seemed incredible but nothing else could account for that statuesque alertness
the sheep held this rigid position for perhaps fifteen minutes
then the leading ram started to approach
the others followed
he took a few steps then halted
always he held his head up nose pointed
by george they're coming
exclaimed gale
they see that flag
they're hunting us
they're curious
if this doesn't beat me
evidently the indian understood for he grunted
gale found difficulty in curbing his impatience
the approach of the sheep was slow
the advances of the leader and the intervals of watching had a singular regularity
he worked like a machine
gale followed him down the opposite wall around holes across gullies over ridges
then gale shifted the glass back to find the others
they were coming also with exactly the same pace and pause of their leader
what steppers they were
how surefooted
what leaps they made
it was thrilling to watch them
gale forgot he had a rifle
the yaqui pressed a heavy hand down upon his shoulder
he was to keep well hidden and to be quiet
gale suddenly conceived the idea that the sheep might come clear across to investigate the puzzling red thing fluttering in the breeze
strange indeed would that be for the wildest creatures in the world
the big ram led on with the same regular persistence and in half an hour's time he was in the bottom of the great gulf and soon he was facing up the slope
gale knew then that the alluring scarf had fascinated him
it was no longer necessary now for gale to use his glass
there was a short period when an intervening crest of lava hid the sheep from view
after that the two rams and their smaller followers were plainly in sight for perhaps a quarter of an hour
then they disappeared behind another ridge
gale kept watching sure they would come out farther on
a tense period of waiting passed then a suddenly electrifying pressure of yaqui's hand made gale tremble with excitement
very cautiously he shifted his position
there not fifty feet distant upon a high mound of lava stood the leader of the sheep
his size astounded gale
he seemed all horns
but only for a moment did the impression of horns overbalancing body remain with gale
the sheep was graceful sinewy slender powerfully built and in poise magnificent
as gale watched spellbound the second ram leaped lightly upon the mound and presently the three others did likewise
then indeed gale feasted his eyes with a spectacle for a hunter
it came to him suddenly that there had been something he expected to see in this rocky mountain bighorn and it was lacking
they were beautiful as wonderful as even ladd's encomiums had led him to suppose
he thought perhaps it was the contrast these soft sleek shortfurred graceful animals afforded to what he imagined the barren terrible lava mountains might develop
the splendid leader stepped closer his round protruding amber eyes which gale could now plainly see intent upon that fatal red flag
like automatons the other four crowded into his tracks
a few little slow steps then the leader halted
at this instant gale's absorbed attention was directed by yaqui to the rifle and so to the purpose of the climb
a little cold shock affronted gale's vivid pleasure
with it dawned a realization of what he had imagined was lacking in these animals
they did not look wild
the socalled wildest of wild creatures appeared tamer than sheep he had followed on a farm
it would be little less than murder to kill them
gale regretted the need of slaughter
nevertheless he could not resist the desire to show himself and see how tame they really were
he reached for the  and as he threw a shell into the chamber the slight metallic click made the sheep jump
then gale rose quickly to his feet
the noble ram and his band simply stared at gale
they had never seen a man
they showed not the slightest indication of instinctive fear
curiosity surprise even friendliness seemed to mark their attitude of attention
gale imagined that they were going to step still closer
he did not choose to wait to see if this were true
certainly it already took a grim resolution to raise the heavy 
his shot killed the big leader
the others bounded away with remarkable nimbleness
gale used up the remaining four shells to drop the second ram and by the time he had reloaded the others were out of range
the yaqui's method of hunting was sure and deadly and saving of energy but gale never would try it again
he chose to stalk the game
this entailed a great expenditure of strength the eyes and lungs of a mountaineer and as gale put it to ladd the need of sevenleague boots
after being hunted a few times and shot at the sheep became exceedingly difficult to approach
gale learned to know that their fame as the keenesteyed of all animals was well founded
if he worked directly toward a flock crawling over the sharp lava always a sentinel ram espied him before he got within range
the only method of attack that he found successful was to locate sheep with his glass work round to windward of them and then getting behind a ridge or buttress crawl like a lizard to a vantage point
he failed often
the stalk called forth all that was in him of endurance cunning speed
as the days grew hotter he hunted in the early morning hours and a while before the sun went down
more than one night he lay out on the lava with the great stars close overhead and the immense void all beneath him
this pursuit he learned to love
upon those scarred and blasted slopes the wild spirit that was in him had free rein
and like a shadow the faithful yaqui tried ever to keep at his heels
one morning the rising sun greeted him as he surmounted the higher cone of the volcano
he saw the vastness of the east aglow with a glazed rosy whiteness like the changing hue of an ember
at this height there was a sweeping wind still cool
the western slopes of lava lay dark and all that world of sand and gulf and mountain barrier beyond was shrouded in the mystic cloud of distance
gale had assimilated much of the loneliness and the sense of ownership and the love of lofty heights that might well belong to the great condor of the peak
like this widewinged bird he had an unparalleled range of vision
the very corners whence came the winds seemed pierced by gale's eyes
yaqui spied a flock of sheep far under the curved broken rim of the main crater
then began the stalk
gale had taught the yaqui somethingthat speed might win as well as patient cunning
keeping out of sight gale ran over the spikecrusted lava leaving the indian far behind
his feet were magnets attracting supporting holds and he passed over them too fast to fall
the wind the keen air of the heights the red lava the boundless surrounding blue all seemed to have something to do with his wildness
then hiding slipping creeping crawling he closed in upon his quarry until the long rifle grew like stone in his grip and the whipping spang ripped the silence and the strange echo boomed deep in the crater and rolled around as if in hollow mockery at the hopelessness of escape
gale's exultant yell was given as much to free himself of some bursting joy of action as it was to call the slower yaqui
then he liked the strange echoes
it was a maddening whirl of sound that bored deeper and deeper along the whorled and caverned walls of the crater
it was as if these aged walls resented the violating of their silent sanctity
gale felt himself a man a thing alive something superior to all this savage dead upflung world of iron a master even of all this grandeur and sublimity because he had a soul
he waited beside his quarry and breathed deep and swept the long slopes with searching eyes of habit
when yaqui came up they set about the hardest task of all to pack the best of that heavy sheep down miles of steep ragged choyacovered lava
but even in this gale rejoiced
the heat was nothing the millions of little pits which could hold and twist a foot were nothing the bladeedged crusts and the deep fissures and the choked canyons and the tangled dwarfed mesquites all these were as nothing but obstacles to be cheerfully overcome
only the choya hindered dick gale
when his heavy burden pulled him out of surefootedness and he plunged into a choya or when the strange deceitful uncanny almost invisible frosty thorns caught and pierced him then there was call for all of fortitude and endurance
for this cactus had a malignant power of torture
its pain was a stinging blinding burning sickening poison in the blood
if thorns pierced his legs he felt the pain all over his body if his hands rose from a fall full of the barbed joints he was helpless and quivering till yaqui tore them out
but this one peril dreaded more than dizzy height of precipice or sunblindness on the glistening peak did not daunt gale
his teacher was the yaqui and always before him was an example that made him despair of a white man's equality
color race blood breedingwhat were these in the wilderness
verily dick gale had come to learn the use of his hands
so in a descent of hours he toiled down the lava slope to stalk into the arroyo like a burdened giant wringing wet panting cleareyed and darkfaced his ragged clothes and boots white with choya thorns
the gaunt ladd rose from his shaded seat and removed his pipe from smiling lips and turned to nod at jim and then looked back again
the torrid summer heat came imperceptibly or it could never have been borne by white men
it changed the lives of the fugitives making them partly nocturnal in habit
the nights had the balmy coolness of spring and would have been delightful for sleep but that would have made the blazing days unendurable
the sun rose in a vast white flame
with it came the blasting withering wind from the gulf
a red haze like that of earlier sunsets seemed to come sweeping on the wind and it roared up the arroyo and went bellowing into the crater and rushed on in fury to lash the peaks
during these hot windy hours the desertbound party slept in deep recesses in the lava and if necessity brought them forth they could not remain out long
the sand burned through boots and a touch of bare hand on lava raised a blister
a short while before sundown the yaqui went forth to build a campfire and soon the others came out heatdazed half blinded with parching throats to allay and hunger that was never satisfied
a little action and a cooling of the air revived them and when night set in they were comfortable round the campfire
as ladd had said one of their greatest problems was the passing of time
the nights were interminably long but they had to be passed in work or play or dreamanything except sleep
that was ladd's most inflexible command
he gave no reason
but not improbably the ranger thought that the terrific heat of the day spend in slumber lessened a wear and strain if not a real danger of madness
accordingly at first the occupations of this little group were many and various
they worked if they had something to do or could invent a pretext
they told and retold stories until all were wearisome
they sang songs
mercedes taught spanish
they played every game they knew
they invented others that were so trivial children would scarcely have been interested and these they played seriously
in a word with intelligence and passion with all that was civilized and human they fought the everinfringing loneliness the savage solitude of their environment
but they had only finite minds
it was not in reason to expect a complete victory against this mighty nature this bounding horizon of death and desolation and decay
gradually they fell back upon fewer and fewer occupations until the time came when the silence was hard to break
gale believed himself the keenest of the party the one who thought most and he watched the effect of the desert upon his companions
he imagined that he saw ladd grow old sitting round the campfire
certain it was that the ranger's gray hair had turned white
what had been at times hard and cold and grim about him had strangely vanished in sweet temper and a vacantmindedness that held him longer as the days passed
for hours it seemed ladd would bend over his checkerboard and never make a move
it mattered not now whether or not he had a partner
he was always glad of being spoken to as if he were called back from vague region of mind
jim lash the calmest coolest most nonchalant besthumored westerner gale had ever met had by slow degrees lost that cheerful character which would have been of such infinite good to his companions and always he sat brooding silently brooding
jim had no ties few memories and the desert was claiming him
thorne and mercedes however were living wonderful proof that spirit mind and heart were freefree to soar in scorn of the colossal barrenness and silence and space of that terrible hedging prison of lava
they were young they loved they were together and the oasis was almost a paradise
gale believe he helped himself by watching them
imagination had never pictured real happiness to him
thorne and mercedes had forgotten the outside world
if they had been existing on the burnedout desolate moon they could hardly have been in a harsher grimmer lonelier spot than this redwalled arroyo
but it might have been a statelier eden than that of the primitive day
mercedes grew thinner until she was a slender shadow of her former self
she became hard brown as the rangers lithe and quick as a panther
she seemed to live on water and the airperhaps indeed on love
for of the scant fare the best of which was continually urged upon her she partook but little
she reminded gale of a wild brown creature free as the wind on the lava slopes
yet despite the great change her beauty remained undiminished
her eyes seeming so much larger now in her small face were great black starry gulfs
she was the life of that camp
her smiles her rapid speech her low laughter her quick movements her playful moods with the rangers the dark and passionate glance which rested so often on her lover the whispers in the dusk as hand in hand they paced the campfire beatthese helped gale to retain his loosening hold on reality to resist the lure of a strange beckoning life where a man stood free in the golden open where emotion was not nor trouble nor sickness nor anything but the savage's rest and sleep and action and dream
although the yaqui was as his shadow gale reached a point when he seemed to wander alone at twilight in the night at dawn
far down the arroyo in the deepening red twilight when the heat rolled away on slowdying wind blanco sol raised his splendid head and whistled for his master
gale reproached himself for neglect of the noble horse
blanco sol was always the same
he loved four thingshis master a long drink of cool water to graze at will and to run
time and place gale thought meant little to sol if he could have those four things
gale put his arm over the great arched neck and laid his cheek against the long white mane and then even as he stood there forgot the horse
what was the dull redtinged horizonwide mantle creeping up the slope
through it the copper sun glowed paled died
was it only twilight
was it gloom
if he thought about it he had a feeling that it was the herald of night and the night must be a vigil and that made him tremble
at night he had formed a habit of climbing up the lava slope as far as the smooth trail extended and there on a promontory he paced to and fro and watched the stars and sat stonestill for hours looking down at the vast void with its moving changing shadows
from that promontory he gazed up at a velvetblue sky deep and dark bright with millions of cold distant blinking stars and he grasped a little of the meaning of infinitude
he gazed down into the shadows which black as they were and impenetrable yet have a conception of immeasurable space
then the silence
he was dumb he was awed he bowed his head he trembled he marveled at the desert silence
it was the one thing always present
even when the wind roared there seemed to be silence
but at night in this lava world of ashes and canker he waited for this terrible strangeness of nature to come to him with the secret
he seemed at once a little child and a strong man and something very old
what tortured him was the incomprehensibility that the vaster the space the greater the silence
at one moment gale felt there was only death here and that was the secret at another he heard the slow beat of a mighty heart
he came at length to realize that the desert was a teacher
he did not realize all that he had learned but he was a different man
and when he decided upon that he was not thinking of the slow sure call to the primal instincts of man he was thinking that the desert as much as he had experienced and no more would absolutely overturn the whole scale of a man's values break old habits form new ones remake him
more of desert experience gale believe would be too much for intellect
the desert did not breed civilized man and that made gale ponder over a strange thought after all was the civilized man inferior to the savage
yaqui was the answer to that
when gale acknowledged this he always remembered his present strange manner of thought
the past the old order of mind seemed as remote as this desert world was from the haunts of civilized men
a man must know a savage as gale knew yaqui before he could speak authoritatively and then something stilled his tongue
in the first stage of gale's observation of yaqui he had marked tenaciousness of life stoicism endurance strength
these were the attributes of the desert
but what of that second stage wherein the indian had loomed up a colossal figure of strange honor loyalty love
gale doubted his convictions and scorned himself for doubting
there in the gloom sat the silent impassive inscrutable yaqui
his dark face his dark eyes were plain in the light of the stars
always he was near gale unobtrusive shadowy but there
why
gale absolutely could not doubt that the indian had heart as well as mind
yaqui had from the very first stood between gale and accident toil peril
it was his own choosing
gale could not change him or thwart him
he understood the indian's idea of obligation and sacred duty
but there was more and that baffled gale
in the night hours alone on the slope gale felt in yaqui as he felt the mighty throb of that desert pulse a something that drew him irresistibly to the indian
sometimes he looked around to find the indian to dispel these strange pressing thoughts of unreality and it was never in vain
thus the nights passed endlessly long with gale fighting for his old order of thought fighting the fascination of the infinite sky and the gloomy insulating whirl of the wide shadows fighting for belief hope prayer fighting against that terrible everrecurring idea of being lost lost lost in the desert fighting harder than any other thing the insidious penetrating tranquil unfeeling self that was coming between him and his memory
he was losing the battle losing his hold on tangible things losing his power to stand up under this ponderous merciless weight of desert space and silence
he acknowledged it in a kind of despair and the shadows of the night seemed whirling fiends
lost
lost
lost
what are you waiting for
rain
lost
lost
lost in the desert
so the shadows seemed to scream in voiceless mockery
at the moment he was alone on the promontory
the night was far spent
a ghastly moon haunted the black volcanic spurs
the winds blew silently
was he alone
no he did not seem to be alone
the yaqui was there
suddenly a strange cold sensation crept over gale
it was new
he felt a presence
turning he expected to see the indian but instead a slight shadow pale almost white stood there not close nor yet distant
it seemed to brighten
then he saw a woman who resembled a girl he had seemed to know long ago
she was whitefaced goldenhaired and her lips were sweet and her eyes were turning black
nell
he had forgotten her
over him flooded a torrent of memory
there was tragic woe in this sweet face
nell was holding out her armsshe was crying aloud to him across the sand and the cactus and the lava
she was in trouble and he had been forgetting
that night he climbed the lava to the topmost cone and never slipped on a ragged crust nor touched a choya thorn
a voice called to him
he saw nell's eyes in the stars in the velvet blue of sky in the blackness of the engulfing shadows
she was with him a slender shape a spirit keeping step with him and memory was strong sweet beating beautiful
far down in the west faintly golden with light of the sinking moon he saw a cloud that resembled her face
a cloud on the desert horizon
he gazed and gazed
was that a spirit face like the one by his side
nohe did not dream
in the hot sultry morning yaqui appeared at camp after long hours of absence and he pointed with a long dark arm toward the west
a bank of clouds was rising above the mountain barrier
rain
he cried and his sonorous voice rolled down the arroyo
those who heard him were as shipwrecked mariners at sight of a distant sail
dick gale silent grateful to the depths of his soul stood with arm over blanco sol and watched the transforming west where clouds of wonderous size and hue piled over one another rushing darkening spreading sweeping upward toward that white and glowing sun
when they reached the zenith and swept round to blot out the blazing orb the earth took on a dark lowering aspect
the red of sand and lava changed to steely gray
vast shadows like ripples on water sheeted in from the gulf with a low strange moan
yet the silence was like death
the desert was awaiting a strange and hated visitationstorm
if all the endless torrid days the endless mystic nights had seemed unreal to gale what then seemed this stupendous spectacle
oh
i felt a drop of rain on my face
cried mercedes and whispering the name of a saint she kissed her husband
the whitehaired ladd gaunt old bent looked up at the maelstrom of clouds and he said softly shore we'll get in the hosses an' pack light an' hit the trail an' make night marches
then up out of the gulf of the west swept a bellowing wind and a black pall and terrible flashes of lightning and thunder like the end of the worldfury blackness chaos the desert storm
xvii  the whistle of a horse  at the ranchhouse at forlorn river belding stood alone in his darkened room
it was quiet there and quiet outside the sickening midsummer heat like a hot heavy blanket lay upon the house
he took up the gun belt from his table and with slow hands buckled it around his waist
he seemed to feel something familiar and comfortable and inspiring in the weight of the big gun against his hip
he faced the door as if to go out but hesitated and then began a slow plodding walk up and down the length of the room
presently he halted at the table and with reluctant hands he unbuckled the gun belt and laid it down
the action did not have an air of finality and belding knew it
he had seen border life in texas in the early days he had been a sheriff when the law in the west depended on a quickness of wrist he had seen many a man lay down his gun for good and all
his own action was not final
of late he had done the same thing many times and this last time it seemed a little harder to do a little more indicative of vacillation
there were reasons why belding's gun held for him a gloomy fascination
the chases those grasping and conscienceless agents of a new force in the development of the west were bent upon belding's ruin and so far as his fortunes at forlorn river were concerned had almost accomplished it
one by one he lost points for which he contended with them
he carried into the tucson courts the matter of the staked claims and mining claims and water claims and he lost all
following that he lost his government position as inspector of immigration and this fact because of what he considered its injustice had been a hard blow
he had been made to suffer a humiliation equally as great
it came about that he actually had to pay the chases for water to irrigate his alfalfa fields
the neverfailing spring upon his land answered for the needs of household and horses but no more
these matters were unfortunate for belding but not by any means wholly accountable for his worry and unhappiness and brooding hate
he believed dick gale and the rest of the party taken into the desert by the yaqui had been killed or lost
two months before a string of mexican horses riderless saddled starved for grass and wild for water had come in to forlorn river
they were a part of the horses belonging to rojas and his band
their arrival complicated the mystery and strengthened convictions of the loss of both pursuers and pursued
belding was wont to say that he had worried himself gray over the fate of his rangers
belding's unhappiness could hardly be laid to material loss
he had been rich and was now poor but change of fortune such as that could not have made him unhappy
something more somber and mysterious and sad than the loss of dick gale and their friends had come into the lives of his wife and nell
he dated the time of this change back to a certain day when mrs belding recognized in the elder chase an old schoolmate and a rejected suitor
it took time for slowthinking belding to discover anything wrong in his household especially as the fact of the gales lingering there made mrs belding and nell for the most part hide their real and deeper feelings
gradually however belding had forced on him the fact of some secret cause for grief other than gale's loss
he was sure of it when his wife signified her desire to make a visit to her old home back in peoria
she did not give many reasons but she did show him a letter that had found its way from old friends
this letter contained news that may or may not have been authentic but it was enough belding thought to interest his wife
an old prospector had returned to peoria and he had told relatives of meeting robert burton at the sonoyta oasis fifteen years before and that burton had gone into the desert never to return
to belding this was no surprise for he had heard that before his marriage
there appeared to have been no doubts as to the death of his wife's first husband
the singular thing was that both nell's father and grandfather had been lost somewhere in the sonora desert
belding did not oppose his wife's desire to visit her old home
he thought it would be a wholesome trip for her and did all in his power to persuade nell to accompany her
but nell would not go
it was after mrs belding's departure that belding discovered in nell a condition of mind that amazed and distressed him
she had suddenly become strangely wretched so that she could not conceal it from even the gales who of all people belding imagined were the ones to make nell proud
she would tell him nothing
but after a while when he had thought it out he dated this further and more deplorable change in nell back to a day on which he had met nell with radford chase
this indefatigable wooer had not in the least abandoned his suit
something about the fellow made belding grind his teeth
but nell grew not only solicitously but now strangely entreatingly earnest in her importunities to belding not to insult or lay a hand on chase
this had bound belding so far it had made him think and watch
he had never been a man to interfere with his women folk
they could do as they liked and usually that pleased him
but a slow surprise gathered and grew upon him when he saw that nell apparently was accepting young chase's attentions
at least she no longer hid from him
belding could not account for this because he was sure nell cordially despised the fellow
and toward the end he divined if he did not actually know that these chases possessed some strange power over nell and were using it
that stirred a hate in beldinga hate he had felt at the very first and had manfully striven against and which now gave him over to dark brooding thoughts
midsummer passed and the storms came late
but when they arrived they made up for tardiness
belding did not remember so terrible a storm of wind and rain as that which broke the summer's drought
in a few days it seemed altar valley was a bright and green expanse where dust clouds did not rise
forlorn river ran a slow heavy turgid torrent
belding never saw the river in flood that it did not give him joy yet now desert man as he was he suffered a regret when he thought of the great chase reservoir full and overflowing
the dull thunder of the spillway was not pleasant
it was the first time in his life that the sound of falling water jarred upon him
belding noticed workmen once more engaged in the fields bounding his land
the chases had extended a main irrigation ditch down to belding's farm skipped the width of his ground then had gone on down through altar valley
they had exerted every influence to obtain right to connect these ditches by digging through his land but belding had remained obdurate
he refused to have any dealings with them
it was therefore with some curiosity and suspicion that he saw a gang of mexicans once more at work upon these ditches
at daylight next morning a tremendous blast almost threw belding out of his bed
it cracked the adobe walls of his house and broke windows and sent pans and crockery to the floor with a crash
belding's idea was that the store of dynamite kept by the chases for blasting had blown up
hurriedly getting into his clothes he went to nell's room to reassure her and telling her to have a thought for their guests he went out to see what had happened
the villagers were pretty badly frightened
many of the poorly constructed adobe huts had crumbled almost into dust
a great yellow cloud like smoke hung over the river
this appeared to be at the upper end of belding's plot and close to the river
when he reached his fence the smoke and dust were so thick he could scarcely breathe and for a little while he was unable to see what had happened
presently he made out a huge hole in the sand just about where the irrigation ditch had stopped near his line
for some reason or other not clear to belding the mexicans had set off an extraordinarily heavy blast at that point
belding pondered
he did not now for a moment consider an accidental discharge of dynamite
but why had this blast been set off
the loose sandy soil had yielded readily to shovel there were no rocks as far as construction of a ditch was concerned such a blast would have done more harm than good
slowly with reluctant feet belding walked toward a green hollow where in a cluster of willows lay the neverfailing spring that his horses loved so well and indeed which he loved no less
he was actually afraid to part the drooping willows to enter the little cool shady path that led to the spring
then suddenly seized by suspense he ran the rest of the way
he was just in time to see the last of the water
it seemed to sink as in quicksand
the shape of the hole had changed
the tremendous force of the blast in the adjoining field had obstructed or diverted the underground stream of water
belding's neverfailing spring had been ruined
what had made this little plot of ground green and sweet and fragrant was now no more
belding's first feeling was for the pity of it
the pale ajo lilies would bloom no more under those willows
the willows themselves would soon wither and die
he thought how many times in the middle of hot summer nights he had come down to the spring to drink
never again
suddenly he thought of blanco diablo
how the great white thoroughbred had loved this spring
belding straightened up and looked with tearblurred eyes out over the waste of desert to the west
never a day passed that he had not thought of the splendid horse but this moment with its significant memory was doubly keen and there came a dull pang in his breast
diablo will never drink here again
muttered belding
the loss of blanco diablo though admitted and mourned by belding had never seemed quite real until this moment
the pall of dust drifting over him the din of the falling water up at the dam diverted belding's mind to the chases
all at once he was in the harsh grip of a cold certainty
the blast had been set off intentionally to ruin his spring
what a hellish trick
no westerner no indian or mexican no desert man could have been guilty of such a crime
to ruin a beautiful clear cool neverfailing stream of water in the desert
it was then that belding's worry and indecision and brooding were as if they had never existed
as he strode swiftly back to the house his head which had long been bent thoughtfully and sadly was held erect
he went directly to his room and with an air that was now final he buckled on his gun belt
he looked the gun over and tried the action
he squared himself and walked a little more erect
some longlost individuality had returned to belding
let's see he was saying
i can get carter to send the horses i've left back to waco to my brother
i'll make nell take what money there is and go hunt up her mother
the gales are ready to gotoday if i say the word
nell can travel with them part way east
that's your game tom belding don't mistake me
as he went out he encountered mr gale coming up the walk
the long sojourn at forlorn river despite the fact that it had been laden with a suspense which was gradually changing to a sad certainty had been of great benefit to dick's father
the dry air the heat and the quiet had made him if not entirely a well man certainly stronger than he had been in many years
belding what was that terrible roar
asked mr gale
we were badly frightened until miss nell came to us
we feared it was an earthquake
well i'll tell you mr gale we've had some quakes here but none of them could hold a candle to this jar we just had
then belding explained what had caused the explosion and why it had been set off so close to his property
it's an outrage sir an unspeakable outrage declared mr gale hotly
such a thing would not be tolerated in the east
mr belding i'm amazed at your attitude in the face of all this trickery
you seethere was mother and nell began belding as if apologizing
he dropped his head a little and made marks in the sand with the toe of his boot
mr gale i've been sort of half hitched as laddy used to say
i'm planning to have a little more elbow room round this ranch
i'm going to send nell east to her mother
then i'll  see here mr gale would you mind having nell with you part way when you go home
we'd all be delighted to have her go all the way and make us a visit replied mr gale
that's fine
and you'll be going soon
don't take that as if i wanted to belding paused for the truth was that he did want to hurry them off
we would have been gone before this but for you said mr gale
long ago we gave up hope ofof richard ever returning
and i believe now we're sure he was lost that we'd do well to go home at once
you wished us to remain until the heat was brokentill the rains came to make traveling easier for us
now i see no need for further delay
my stay here has greatly benefited my health
i shall never forget your hospitality
this western trip would have made me a new man ifonlyrichard  sure
i understand said belding gruffly
let's go in and tell the women to pack up
nell was busy with the servants preparing breakfast
belding took her into the sittingroom while mr gale called his wife and daughter
my girl i've some news for you began belding
mr gale is leaving today with his family
i'm going to send you with thempart way anyhow
you're invited to visit them
i think that 'd be great for youhelp you to forget
but the main thing isyou're going east to join mother
nell gazed at him whitefaced without uttering a word
you see nell i'm about done in forlorn river went on belding
that blast this morning sank my spring
there's no water now
it was the last straw
so we'll shake the dust of forlorn river
i'll come on a little laterthat's all
dad you're packing your gun
exclaimed nell suddenly pointing with a trembling finger
she ran to him and for the first time in his life belding put her away from him
his movements had lost the old slow gentleness
why so i am replied belding coolly as his hand moved down to the sheath swinging at his hip
nell i'm that absentminded these days
dad
she cried
that'll do from you he replied in a voice he had never used to her
get breakfast now then pack to leave forlorn river
leave forlorn river
whispered nell with a thin white hand stealing up to her breast
how changed the girl was
belding reproached himself for his hardness but did not speak his thought aloud
nell was fading here just as mercedes had faded before the coming of thorne
nell turned away to the west window and looked out across the desert toward the dim blue peaks in the distance
belding watched her likewise the gales and no one spoke
there ensued a long silence
belding felt a lump rise in his throat
nell laid her arm against the window frame but gradually it dropped and she was leaning with her face against the wood
a low sob broke from her
elsie gale went to her embraced her took the drooping head on her shoulder
we've come to be such friends she said
i believe it'll be good for you to visit me in the city
hereall day you look out across that awful lonely desert come nell
heavy steps sounded outside on the flagstones then the door rattled under a strong knock
belding opened it
the chases father and son stood beyond the threshold
good morning belding said the elder chase
we were routed out early by that big blast and came up to see what was wrong
all a blunder
the greaser foreman was drunk yesterday and his ignorant men made a mistake
sorry if the blast bothered you
chase i reckon that's the first of your blasts i was ever glad to hear replied belding in a way that made chase look blank
so
well i'm glad you're glad he went on evidently puzzled
i was a little worriedyou've always been so touchywe never could get together
i hurried over fearing maybe you might think the blastyou see belding  i see this mr ben chase interrupted belding in curt and ringing voice
that blast was a mistake the biggest you ever made in your life
what do you mean
demanded chase
you'll have to excuse me for a while unless you're dead set on having it out right now
mr gale and his family are leaving and my daughter is going with them
i'd rather you'd wait a little
nell going away
exclaimed radford chase
he reminded belding of an overgrown boy in disappointment
yes
butmiss burton to you young man  mr belding i certainly would prefer a conference with you right now interposed the elder chase cutting short belding's strange speech
there are other mattersimportant matters to discuss
they've got to be settled
may we step in sir
no you may not replied belding bluntly
i'm sure particular who i invite into my house
but i'll go with you
belding stepped out and closed the door
come away from the house so the women won't hear thethe talk
the elder chase was purple with rage yet seemed to be controlling it
the younger man looked black sullen impatient
he appeared not to have a thought of belding
he was absolutely blind to the situation as considered from belding's point of view
ben chase found his voice about the time belding halted under the trees out of earshot from the house
sir you've insulted memy son
how dare you
i want you to understand that you're  chop that kind of talk with me you    
interrupted belding
he had always been profane and now he certainly did not choose his language
chase turned livid gasped and seemed about to give way to fury
but something about belding evidently exerted a powerful quieting influence
if you talk sense i'll listen went on belding
belding was frankly curious
he did not think any argument or inducement offered by chase could change his mind on past dealings or his purpose of the present
but he believed by listening he might get some light on what had long puzzled him
the masterly effort chase put forth to conquer his aroused passions gave belding another idea of the character of this promoter
i want to make a last effort to propitiate you began chase in his quick smooth voice
that was a singular change to beldingthe dropping instantly into an easy flow of speech
you've had losses here and naturally you're sore
i don't blame you
but you can't see this thing from my side of the fence
business is business
in business the best man wins
the law upheld those transactions of mine the honesty of which you questioned
as to mining and water claims you lost on this technical pointthat you had nothing to prove you had held them for five years
five years is the time necessary in law
a dozen men might claim the source of forlorn river but if they had no house or papers to prove their squatters' rights any man could go in and fight them for the water
 now i want to run that main ditch along the river through your farm
can't we make a deal
i'm ready to be liberalto meet you more than halfway
i'll give you an interest in the company
i think i've influence enough up at the capitol to have you reinstated as inspector
a little reasonableness on your part will put you right again in forlorn river with a chance of growing rich
there's a big future here my interest belding has become personal
radford is in love with your stepdaughter
he wants to marry her
i'll admit now if i had foreseen this situation i wouldn't have pushed you so hard
but we can square the thing
now let's get together not only in business but in a family way
if my son's happiness depends upon having this girl you may rest assured i'll do all i can to get her for him
i'll absolutely make good all your losses
now what do you say
no replied belding
your money can't buy a right of way across my ranch
and nell doesn't want your son
that settles that
but you could persuade her
i won't that's all
may i ask why
chases's voice was losing its suave quality but it was even swifter than before
sure
i don't mind your asking replied belding in slow deliberation
i wouldn't do such a lowdown trick
besides if i would i'd want it to be a man i was persuading for
i know greasersi know a yaqui i'd rather give nell to than your son
radford chase began to roar in inarticulate rage
belding paid no attention to him indeed he never glanced at the young man
the elder chase checked a violent start
he plucked at the collar of his gray flannel shirt opened it at the neck
my son's offer of marriage is an honormore an honor sir than you perhaps are aware of
belding made no reply
his steady gaze did not turn from the long lane that led down to the river
he waited coldly sure of himself
mrs belding's daughter has no right to the name of burton snapped chase
did you know that
i did not replied belding quietly
well you know it now added chase bitingly
sure you can prove what you say
queried belding in the same cool unemotional tone
it struck him strangely at the moment what little knowledge this man had of the west and of western character
prove it
why yes i think so enough to make the truth plain to any reasonable man
i come from peoriawas born and raised there
i went to school with nell warren
that was your wife's maiden name
she was a beautiful gay girl
all the fellows were in love with her
i knew bob burton well
he was a splendid fellow but wild
nobody ever knew for sure but we all supposed he was engaged to marry nell
he left peoria however and soon after that the truth about nell came out
she ran away
it was at least a couple of months before burton showed up in peoria
he did not stay long
then for years nothing was heard of either of them
when word did come nell was in oklahoma burton was in denver
there's chance of course that burton followed nell and married her
that would account for nell warren taking the name of burton
but it isn't likely
none of us ever heard of such a thing and wouldn't have believed it if we had
the affair seemed destined to end unfortunately
but belding while i'm at it i want to say that nell warren was one of the sweetest finest truest girls in the world
if she drifted to the southwest and kept her past a secret that was only natural
certainly it should not be held against her
why she was only a childa girlseventeeneighteen years old
in a moment of amazementwhen i recognized your wife as an old schoolmatei blurted the thing out to radford
you see now how little it matters to me when i ask your stepdaughter's hand in marriage for my son
belding stood listening
the genuine emotion in chase's voice was as strong as the ring of truth
belding knew truth when he heard it
the revelation did not surprise him
belding did not soften for he devined that chase's emotion was due to the probing of an old wound the recalling of a past both happy and painful
still human nature was so strange that perhaps kindness and sympathy might yet have a place in this chase's heart
belding did not believe so but he was willing to give chase the benefit of the doubt
so you told my wife you'd respect her secretkeep her dishonor from husband and daughter
demanded belding his dark gaze sweeping back from the lane
what
ii stammered chase
you made your son swear to be a man and die before he'd hint the thing to nell
went on belding and his voice rang louder
ben chase had no answer
the red left his face
his son slunk back against the fence
i say you never held this secret over the heads of my wife and her daughter
thundered belding
he had his answer in the gray faces in the lips that fear made mute
like a flash belding saw the whole truth of mrs belding's agony the reason for her departure he saw what had been driving nell and it seemed that all the dogs of hell were loosed within his heart
he struck out blindly instinctively in his pain and the blow sent ben chase staggering into the fence corner
then he stretched forth a long arm and whirled radford chase back beside his father
i see it all now went on belding hoarsely
you found the woman's weaknessher love for the girl
you found the girl's weaknessher pride and fear of shame
so you drove the one and hounded the other
god what a base thing to do
to tell the girl was bad enough but to threaten her with betrayal there's no name for that
belding's voice thickened and he paused breathing heavily
he stepped back a few paces and this an ominous action for an armed man of his kind instead of adding to the fear of the chases seemed to relieve them
if there had been any pity in belding's heart he would have felt it then
and now gentlemen continued belding speaking low and with difficulty seeing i've turned down your proposition i suppose you think you've no more call to keep your mouths shut
the elder chase appeared fascinated by something he either saw or felt in belding and his gray face grew grayer
he put up a shaking hand
then radford chase livid and snarling burst out i'll talk till i'm black in the face
you can't stop me
you'll go black in the face but it won't be from talking hissed belding
his big arm swept down and when he threw it up the gun glittered in his hand
simultaneously with the latter action pealed out a shrill penetrating whistle
the whistle of a horse
it froze belding's arm aloft
for an instant he could not move even his eyes
the familiarity of that whistle was terrible in its power to rob him of strength
then he heard the rapid heavy pound of hoofs and again the piercing whistle
blanco diablo
he cried huskily
he turned to see a huge white horse come thundering into the yard
a wild gaunt terrible horse indeed the loved blanco diablo
a bronzed longhaired indian bestrode him
more white horses galloped into the yard pounded to a halt whistling home
belding saw a slim shadow of a girl who seemed all great black eyes
under the trees flashed blanco sol as dazzling white as beautiful as if he had never been lost in the desert
he slid to a halt then plunged and stamped
his rider leaped throwing the bridle
belding saw a powerful spare ragged man with dark gaunt face and eyes of flame
then nell came running from the house her golden hair flying her hands outstretched her face wonderful
dick
dick
ohhh dick
she cried
her voice seemed to quiver in belding's heart
belding's eyes began to blur
he was not sure he saw clearly
whose face was this now close before hima long thin shrunken face haggard tragic in its semblance of torture almost of death
but the eyes were keen and kind
belding thought wildly that they proved he was not dreaming
i shore am glad to see you all said a wellremembered voice in a slow cool drawl
xviii  reality against dreams  ladd lash thorne mercedes they were all held tight in belding's arms
then he ran to blanco diablo
for once the great horse was gentle quiet glad
he remembered this kindest of masters and reached for him with warm wet muzzle
dick gale was standing bowed over nell's slight form almost hidden in his arms
belding hugged them both
he was like a boy
he saw ben chase and his son slip away under the trees but the circumstances meant nothing to him then
dick
dick
he roared
is it you
say who do you think's herehere in forlorn river
gale gripped belding with a hand as rough and hard as a file and as strong as a vise
but he did not speak a word
belding thought gale's eyes would haunt him forever
it was then three more persons came upon the sceneelsie gale running swiftly her father assisting mrs gale who appeared about to faint
belding
who on earth's that
cried dick hoarsely
quien sabe my son replied belding and now his voice seemed a little shaky
nell come here
give him a chance
belding slipped his arm round nell and whispered in her ear
this 'll be great
elsie gale's face was white and agitated a face expressing extreme joy
oh brother
mama saw youpapa saw you and never knew you
but i knew you when you jumped quickthat wayoff your horse
and now i don't know you
you wild man
you giant
you splendid barbarian
mama papa hurry
it is dick
look at him
just look at him
ohh thank god
belding turned away and drew nell with him
in another second she and mercedes were clasped in each other's arms
then followed a time of joyful greetings all round
the yaqui stood leaning against a tree watching the welcoming home of the lost
no one seemed to think of him until belding ever mindful of the needs of horses put a hand on blanco diablo and called to yaqui to bring the others
they led the string of whites down to the barn freed them of wet and dusty saddles and packs and turned them loose in the alfalfa now breasthigh
diablo found his old spirit blanco sol tossed his head and whistled his satisfaction white woman pranced to and fro and presently they all settled down to quiet grazing
how good it was for belding to see those white shapes against the rich background of green
his eyes glistened
it was a sight he had never expected to see again
he lingered there many moments when he wanted to hurry back to his rangers
at last he tore himself away from watching blanco diablo and returned to the house
it was only to find that he might have spared himself the hurry
jim and ladd were lying on the beds that had not held them for so many months
their slumber seemed as deep and quiet as death
curiously belding gazed down upon them
they had removed only boots and chaps
their clothes were in tatters
jim appeared little more than skin and bones a long shape dark and hard as iron
ladd's appearance shocked belding
the ranger looked an old man blasted shriveled starved
yet his gaunt face though terrible in its records of tortures had something fine and noble even beautiful to belding in its strength its victory
thorne and mercedes had disappeared
the low murmur of voices came from mrs gale's room and belding concluded that dick was still with his family
no doubt he also would soon seek rest and sleep
belding went through the patio and called in at nell's door
she was there sitting by her window
the flush of happiness had not left her face but she looked stunned and a shadow of fear lay dark in her eyes
belding had intended to talk
he wanted some one to listen to him
the expression in nell's eyes however silenced him
he had forgotten
nell read his thought in his face and then she lost all her color and dropped her head
belding entered stood beside her with a hand on hers
he tried desperately hard to think of the right thing to say and realized so long as he tried that he could not speak at all
nelldick's back safe and sound he said slowly
that's the main thing
i wish you could have seen his eyes when he held you in his arms out there of course dick's coming knocks out your trip east and changes plans generally
we haven't had the happiest time lately
but now it'll be different
dick's as true as a yaqui
he'll chase that chase fellow don't mistake me then mother will be home soon
she'll straighten out thisthis mystery
and nellhowever it turns outi know dick gale will feel just the same as i feel
brace up now girl
belding left the patio and traced thoughtful steps back toward the corrals
he realized the need of his wife
if she had been at home he would not have come so close to killing two men
nell would never have fallen so low in spirit
whatever the real truth of the tragedy of his wife's life it would not make the slightest difference to him
what hurt him was the pain mother and daughter had suffered were suffering still
somehow he must put an end to that pain
he found the yaqui curled up in a corner of the barn in as deep a sleep as that of the rangers
looking down at him belding felt again the rush of curious thrilling eagerness to learn all that had happened since the dark night when yaqui had led the white horses away into the desert
belding curbed his impatience and set to work upon tasks he had long neglected
presently he was interrupted by mr gale who came out beside himself with happiness and excitement
he flung a hundred questions at belding and never gave him time to answer one even if that had been possible
finally when mr gale lost his breath belding got a word in
see here mr gale you know as much as i know
dick's back
they're all backa hard lot starved burned torn to pieces worked out to the limit i never saw in desert travelers but they're alivealive and well man
just wait
just gamble i won't sleep or eat till i hear that story
but they've got to sleep and eat
belding gathered with growing amusement that besides the joy excitement anxiety impatience expressed by mr gale there was something else which belding took for pride
it pleased him
looking back he remembered some of the things dick had confessed his father thought of him
belding's sympathy had always been with the boy
but he had learned to like the old man to find him kind and wise and to think that perhaps college and business had not brought out the best in richard gale
the west had done that however as it had for many a wild youngster and belding resolved to have a little fun at the expense of mr gale
so he began by making a few remarks that appeared to rob dick's father of both speech and breath
and don't mistake me concluded belding just keep out of earshot when laddy tells us the story of that desert trip unless you're hankering to have your hair turn pure white and stand curled on end and freeze that way
about the middle of the forenoon on the following day the rangers hobbled out of the kitchen to the porch
i'm a sick man i tell you ladd was complaining an' i gotta be fed
soup
beef tea
that ain't so much as wind to me
i want about a barrel of bread an' butter an' a whole platter of mashed potatoes with gravy an' green stuffall kinds of green stuffan' a whole big apple pie
give me everythin' an' anythin' to eat but meat
shore i never never want to taste meat again an' sight of a piece of sheep meat would jest about finish me jim you used to be a human bein' that stood up for charlie ladd
laddy i'm lined up beside you with both guns replied jim plaintively
hungry
say the smell of breakfast in that kitchen made my mouth water so i near choked to death
i reckon we're gettin' most onhuman treatment
but i'm a sick man protested ladd an' i'm agoin' to fall over in a minute if somebody doesn't feed me
nell you used to be fond of me
oh laddy i am yet replied nell
shore i don't believe it
any girl with a tender heart just couldn't let a man starve under her eyes look at dick there
i'll bet he's had something to eat mebbe potatoes an' gravy an' pie an'  laddy dick has had no more than i gave youindeed not nearly so much
shore he's had a lot of kisses then for he hasn't hollered onct about this treatment
perhaps he has said nell with a blush and if you think thatthey would help you to be reasonable i mighti'll  well powerful fond as i am of you just now kisses 'll have to run second to bread an' butter
oh laddy what a gallant speech
laughed nell
i'm sorry but i've dad's orders
laddy interrupted belding you've got to be broke in gradually to eating
now you know that
you'd be the severest kind of a boss if you had some starved beggars on your hands
but i'm sicki'm dyin' howled ladd
you were never sick in your life and if all the bullet holes i see in you couldn't kill you why you never will die
can i smoke
queried ladd with sudden animation
my gawd i used to smoke
shore i've forgot
nell if you want to be reinstated in my gallery of angels just find me a pipe an' tobacco
i've hung onto my pipe said jim thoughtfully
i reckon i had it empty in my mouth for seven years or so wasn't it laddy
a long time
i can see the red lava an' the red haze an' the red twilight creepin' up
it was hot an' some lonely
then the wind and always that awful silence
an' always yaqui watchin' the west an' laddy with his checkers an' mercedes burnin' up wastin' away to nothin' but eyes
it's all therei'll never get rid  chop that kind of talk interrupted belding bluntly
tell us where yaqui took youwhat happened to rojaswhy you seemed lost for so long
i reckon laddy can tell all that best but when it comes to rojas's finish i'll tell what i seen an' so'll dick an' thorne
laddy missed rojas's finish
bar none that was the  i'm a sick man but i can talk put in ladd an' shore i don't want the whole story exaggerated none by jim
ladd filled the pipe nell brought puffed ecstatically at it and settled himself upon the bench for a long talk
nell glanced appealingly at dick who tried to slip away
mercedes did go and was followed by thorne
mr gale brought chairs and in subdued excitement called his wife and daughter
belding leaned forward rendered all the more eager by dick's reluctance to stay the memory of the quick tragic change in the expression of mercedes's beautiful eyes by the strange gloomy cast stealing over ladd's face
the ranger talked for two hourstalked till his voice weakened to a husky whisper
at the conclusion of his story there was an impressive silence
then elsie gale stood up and with her hand on dick's shoulder her eyes bright and warm as sunlight she showed the rangers what a woman thought of them and of the yaqui
nell clung to dick weeping silently
mrs gale was overcome and mr gale very white and quiet helped her up to her room
the indian
the indian
burst out belding his voice deep and rolling
what did i tell you
didn't i say he'd be a godsend
remember what i said about yaqui and some gory aztec knifework
so he cut rojas loose from that awful crater wall foot by foot finger by finger slow and terrible
and rojas didn't hang long on the choya thorns
thank the lord for that
laddy no story of camino del diablo can hold a candle to yours
the flight and the fight were jobs for men
but living through this long hot summer and coming outthat's a miracle
only the yaqui could have done it
the yaqui
the yaqui
shore
charlie ladd looks up at an indian these days
but beldin' as for the comin' out don't forget the hosses
without grand old sol an' diablo who i don't hate no more an' the other blancos we'd never have got here
yaqui an' the hosses that's my story
early in the afternoon of the next day belding encountered dick at the water barrel
belding this is river water and muddy at that said dick
lord knows i'm not kicking
but i've dreamed some of our cool running spring and i want a drink from it
never again son
the spring's gone faded sunk dry as dust
dry
gale slowly straightened
we've had rains
the river's full
the spring ought to be overflowing
what's wrong
why is it dry
dick seeing you're interested i may as well tell you that a big charge of nitroglycerin choked my spring
nitroglycerin
echoed gale
then he gave a quick start
my mind's been on home nell my family
but all the same i felt something was wrong here with the ranch with you with nell belding that ditch there is dry
the roses are dead
the little green in that grass has come with the rains
what's happened
the ranch's run down
now i look around i see a change
some change yes replied belding bitterly
listen son
briefly but not the less forcibly for that belding related his story of the operations of the chases
astonishment appeared to be gale's first feeling
our water gone our claims gone our plans forestalled
why belding it's unbelievable
forlorn river with promoters business railroad bank and what not
suddenly he became fiery and suspicious
these chasesdid they do all this on the level
barefaced robbery
worse than a greaser holdup replied belding grimly
you say the law upheld them
sure
why ben chase has a pull as strong as diablo's on a down grade
dick we're jobbed outfigured beat tricked and we can't do a thing
oh i'm sorry belding most of all for laddy said gale feelingly
he's all in
he'll never ride again
he wanted to settle down here on the farm he thought he owned grow grass and raise horses and take it easy
oh but it's tough
say he doesn't know it yet
he was just telling me he'd like to go out and look the farm over
who's going to tell him
what's he going to do when he finds out about this deal
son that's made me think some replied belding with keen eyes fast upon the young man
and i was kind of wondering how you'd take it
i
well i'll call on the chases
look here belding i'd better do some forestalling myself
if laddy gets started now there'll be blood spilled
he's not just right in his mind yet
he talks in his sleep sometimes about how yaqui finished rojas
if it's left to himhe'll kill these men
but if i take it up  you're talking sense dick
only here i'm not so sure of you
and there's more to tell
son you've nell to think of and your mother
belding's ranger gave him a long and searching glance
you can be sure of me he said
all right then listen began belding
with deep voice that had many a beak and tremor he told gale how nell had been hounded by radford chase how her mother had been driven by ben chasethe whole sad story
so that's the trouble
poor little girl
murmured gale brokenly
i felt something was wrong
nell wasn't natural like her old self
and when i begged her to marry me soon while dad was here she couldn't talk
she could only cry
it was hard on nell said belding simply
but it 'll be better now you're back
dick i know the girl
she'll refuse to marry you and you'll have a hard job to break her down as hard as the one you just rode in off of
i think i know you too or i wouldn't be saying  belding what 're you hinting at
demanded gale
do you dare insinuate thatthatif the thing were true it'd make any difference to me
aw come now dick i couldn't mean that
i'm only awkward at saying things
and i'm cut pretty deep  for god's sake you don't believe what chase said
queried gale in passionate haste
it's a lie
i swear it's a lie
i know it's a lie
and i've got to tell nell this minute
come on in with me
i want you belding
oh why didn't you tell me sooner
belding felt himself dragged by an iron arm into the sittingroom out into the patio and across that to where nell sat in her door
at sight of them she gave a little cry drooped for an instant then raised a pale still face with eyes beginning to darken
dearest i know now why you are not wearing my mother's ring said gale steadily and lowvoiced
dick i am not worthy she replied and held out a trembling hand with the ring lying in the palm
swift as light gale caught her hand and slipped the ring back upon the third finger
nell
look at me
it is your engagement ring
listen
i don't believe thisthis thing that's been torturing you
i know it's a lie
i am absolutely sure your mother will prove it a lie
she must have suffered onceperhaps there was a sad errorbut the thing you fear is not true
but hear me dearest even if it was true it wouldn't make the slightest difference to me
i'd promise you on my honor i'd never think of it again
i'd love you all the more because you'd suffered
i want you all the more to be my wifeto let me make you forgetto  she rose swiftly with the passionate abandon of a woman stirred to her depths and she kissed him
oh dick you're goodso good
you'll never knowjust what those words mean to me
they've saved mei think
then dearest it's all right
dick questioned eagerly
you will keep your promise
you will marry me
the glow the light faded out of her face and now the blue eyes were almost black
she drooped and shook her head
nell
exclaimed gale sharply catching his breath
don't ask me dick
ii won't marry you
why
you know
it's true that i  it's a lie interrupted gale fiercely
but even if it's truewhywhy won't you marry me
between you and me love is the thing
love and nothing else
don't you love me any more
they had forgotten belding who stepped back into the shade
i love you with my whole heart and soul
i'd die for you whispered nell with clenching hands
but i won't disgrace you
dear you have worried over this trouble till you're morbid
it has grown out of all proportion
i tell you that i'll not only be the happiest man on earth but the luckiest if you marry me
dick you give not one thought to your family
would they receive me as your wife
they surely would replied gale steadily
no
oh no
you're wrong nell
i'm glad you said that
you give me a chance to prove something
i'll go this minute and tell them all
i'll be back here in less than  dick you will not tell heryour mother
cried nell with her eyes streaming
you will not
oh i can't bear it
she's so proud
and dick i love her
don't tell her
please please don't
she'll be going soon
she needn't ever knowabout me
i want her always to think well of me
dick i beg of you
oh the fear of her knowing has been the worst of all
please don't go
nell i'm sorry
i hate to hurt you
but you're wrong
you can't see things clearly
this is your happiness i'm fighting for
and it's my life
wait here dear
i won't be long
gale ran across the patio and disappeared
nell sank to the doorstep and as she met the question in belding's eyes she shook her head mournfully
they waited without speaking
it seemed a long while before gale returned
belding thrilled at sight of him
there was more boy about him than belding had ever seen
dick was coming swiftly flushed glowing eager erect almost smiling
i told them
i swore it was a lie but i wanted them to decide as if it were true
i didn't have to waste a minute on elsie
she loves you nell
the governor is crazy about you
i didn't have to waste two minutes on him
mother used up the time
she wanted to know all there was to tell
she is proud yes but nell i wish you could have seen how she took thethe story about you
why she never thought of me at all until she had cried over you
nell she loves you too
they all love you
oh it's so good to tell you
i think mother realizes the part you have had in thewhat shall i call itthe regeneration of richard gale
doesn't that sound fine
darling mother not only consents she wants you to be my wife
do you hear that
and listenshe had me in a corner and of course being my mother she put on the screws
she made me promise that we'd live in the east half the year
that means chicago cape may new yorkyou see i'm not exactly the lost son any more
why nell dear you'll have to learn who dick gale really is
but i always want to be the ranger you helped me become and ride blanco sol and see a little of the desert
don't let the idea of big cities frighten you
we'll always love the open places best
now nell say you'll forget this trouble
i know it'll come all right
say you'll marry me soon why dearest you're crying
nell
myheartis broken sobbed nell foriican't marry you
the boyish brightness faded out of gale's face
here belding saw was the stern reality arrayed against his dreams
that devil radford chasehe'll tell my secret panted nell
he swore if you ever came back and married me he'd follow us all over the world to tell it
belding saw gale grow deathly white and suddenly stand stockstill
chase threatened you then
asked dick and the forced naturalness of his voice struck belding
threatened me
he made my life a nightmare replied nell in a rush of speech
at first i wondered how he was worrying mother sick
but she wouldn't tell me
then when she went away he began to hint things
i hated him all the more
but when he told mei was frightened shamed
still i did not weaken
he was pretty decent when he was sober
but when he was half drunk he was the devil
he laughed at me and my pride
i didn't dare shut the door in his face
after a while he found out that your mother loved me and that i loved her
then he began to threaten me
if i didn't give in to him he'd see she learned the truth
that made me weaken
it nearly killed me
i simply could not bear the thought of mrs gale knowing
but i couldn't marry him
besides he got so half the time when he was drunk he didn't want or ask me to be his wife
i was about ready to give up and go mad when youyou came home
she ended in a whisper looking up wistfully and sadly at him
belding was a raging fire within cold without
he watched gale and believed he could foretell that young man's future conduct
gale gathered nell up into his arms and held her to his breast for a long moment
dear nell i'm sure the worst of your trouble is over he said gently
i will not give you up
now won't you lie down try to rest and calm yourself
don't grieve any more
this thing isn't so bad as you make it
trust me
i'll shut mr radford chase's mouth
as he released her she glanced quickly up at him then lifted appealing hands
dick you won't hunt for himgo after him
gale laughed and the laugh made belding jump
dick i beg of you
please don't make trouble
the chases have been hard enough on us
they are rich powerful
dick say you will not make matters worse
please promise me you'll not go to him
you ask me that
he demanded
yes
oh yes
but you know it's useless
what kind of a man do you want me to be
it's only that i'm afraid
oh dick he'd shoot you in the back
no nell a man of his kind wouldn't have nerve enough even for that
you'll go
she cried wildly
gale smiled and the smile made belding cold
dick i cannot keep you back
no he said
then the woman in her burst through instinctive fear and with her eyes blazing black in her white face she lifted parted quivering lips and kissed him
gale left the patio and belding followed closely at his heels
they went through the sittingroom
outside upon the porch sat the rangers mr gale and thorne
dick went into his room without speaking
shore somethin's comin' off said ladd sharply and he sat up with keen eyes narrowing
belding spoke a few words and remembering an impression he had wished to make upon mr gale he made them strong
but now it was with grim humor that he spoke
better stop that boy he concluded looking at mr gale
he'll do some mischief
he's wilder'n hell
stop him
why assuredly replied mr gale rising with nervous haste
just then dick came out of his door
belding eyed him keenly
the only change he could see was that dick had put on a hat and a pair of heavy gloves
richard where are you going
asked his father
i'm going over here to see a man
no
it is my wish that you remain
i forbid you to go said mr gale with a hand on his son's shoulder
dick put mr gale aside gently respectfully yet forcibly
the old man gasped
dad i haven't gotten over my bad habit of disobeying you
i'm sorry
don't interfere with me now
and don't follow me
you might see something unpleasant
but my son
what are you going to do
i'm going to beat a dog
mr gale looked helplessly from this strangely calm and cold son to the restless belding
then dick strode off the porch
hold on
ladd's voice would have stopped almost any man
dick you wasn't agoin' without me
yes i was
but i'm thoughtless just now laddy
shore you was
wait a minute dick
i'm a sick man but at that nobody can pull any stunts round here without me
he hobbled along the porch and went into his room
jim lash knocked the ashes out of his pipe and humming his dance tune he followed ladd
in a moment the rangers appeared and both were packing guns
not a little of belding's grim excitement came from observation of mr gale
at sight of the rangers with their guns the old man turned white and began to tremble
better stay behind whispered belding
dick's going to beat that twolegged dog and the rangers get excited when they're packing guns
i will not stay behind replied mr gale stoutly
i'll see this affair through
belding i've guessed it
richard is going to fight the chases those robbers who have ruined you
well i can't guarantee any fight on their side returned belding dryly
but maybe there'll be greasers with a gun or two
belding stalked off to catch up with dick and mr gale came trudging behind with thorne
where will we find these chases
asked dick of belding
they've got a place down the road adjoining the inn
they call it their club
at this hour radford will be there sure
i don't know about the old man
but his office is now just across the way
they passed several houses turned a corner into the main street and stopped at a wide low adobe structure
a number of saddled horses stood haltered to posts
mexicans lolled around the wide doorway
there's ben chase now over on the corner said belding to dick
see the tall man with the white hair and leather band on his hat
he sees us
he knows there's something up
he's got men with him
they'll come over
we're after the young buck and sure he'll be in here
they entered
the place was a hall and needed only a bar to make it a saloon
there were two rickety pool tables
evidently chase had fitted up this amusement room for his laborers as well as for the use of his engineers and assistants for the crowd contained both mexicans and americans
a large table near a window was surrounded by a noisy smoking drinking circle of cardplayers
point out this radford chase to me said gale
there
the big fellow with the red face
his eyes stick out a little
see
he's dropped his cards and his face isn't red any more
dick strode across the room
belding grasped mr gale and whispered hoarsely don't miss anything
it'll be great
watch dick and watch laddy
if there's any gun play dodge behind me
belding smiled with a grim pleasure as he saw mr gales' face turn white
dick halted beside the table
his heavy boot shot up and with a crash the table split and glasses cards chips flew everywhere
as they rattled down and the chairs of the dumfounded players began to slide dick called out my name is gale
i'm looking for mr radford chase
a tall heavyshouldered fellow rose boldly enough even swaggeringly and glowered at gale
i'm radford chase he said
his voice betrayed the boldness of his action
it was over in a few moments
the tables and chairs were tumbled into a heap one of the pool tables had been shoved aside a lamp lay shattered with oil running dark upon the floor
ladd leaned against a post with a smoking gun in his hand
a mexican crouched close to the wall moaning over a broken arm
in the far corner upheld by comrades another wounded mexican cried out in pain
these two had attempted to draw weapons upon gale and ladd had crippled them
in the center of the room lay radford chase a limp torn hulking bloody figure
he was not seriously injured
but he was helpless a miserable beaten wretch who knew his condition and felt the eyes upon him
he sobbed and moaned and howled
but no one offered to help him to his feet
backed against the door of the hall stood ben chase for once stripped of all authority and confidence and courage
gale confronted him and now gale's mien was in striking contrast to the coolness with which he had entered the place
though sweat dripped from his face it was as white as chalk
like dark flames his eyes seemed to leap and dance and burn
his lean jaw hung down and quivered with passion
he shook a huge gloved fist in chase's face
your gray hairs save you this time
but keep out of my way
and when that son of yours comes to tell him every time i meet him i'll add some more to what he got today
xix  the secret of forlorn river  in the early morning gale seeking solitude where he could brood over his trouble wandered alone
it was not easy for him to elude the yaqui and just at the moment when he had cast himself down in a secluded shady corner the indian appeared noiseless shadowy mysterious as always
malo he said in his deep voice
yes yaqui it's badvery bad replied gale
the indian had been told of the losses sustained by belding and his rangers
gome
said yaqui with an impressive gesture toward the lofty lilaccolored steps of no name mountains
he seemed the same as usual but a glance on gale's part a moment's attention made him conscious of the old strange force in the yaqui
why does my brother want me to climb the nameless mountains with him
asked gale
lluvia d'oro replied yaqui and he made motions that gale found difficult of interpretation
shower of gold translated gale
that was the yaqui's name for nell
what did he mean by using it in connection with a climb into the mountains
were his motions intended to convey an idea of a shower of golden blossoms from that rare and beautiful tree or a golden rain
gale's listlessness vanished in a flash of thought
the yaqui meant gold
gold
he meant he could retrieve the fallen fortunes of the white brother who had saved his life that evil day at the papago well
gale thrilled as he gazed piercingly into the wonderful eyes of this indian
would yaqui never consider his debt paid
gome
repeat the indian pointing with the singular directness that always made this action remarkable in him
yes yaqui
gale ran to his room put on hobnailed boots filled a canteen and hurried back to the corral
yaqui awaited him
the indian carried a coiled lasso and a short stout stick
without a word he led the way down the lane turned up the river toward the mountains
none of belding's household saw their departure
what had once been only a narrow mesquitebordered trail was now a welltrodden road
a deep irrigation ditch full of flowing muddy water ran parallel with the road
gale had been curious about the operations of the chases but bitterness he could not help had kept him from going out to see the work
he was not surprised to find that the engineers who had constructed the ditches and dam had anticipated him in every particular
the dammedup gulch made a magnificent reservoir and gale could not look upon the long narrow lake without a feeling of gladness
the dreaded ano seco of the mexicans might come again and would come but never to the inhabitants of forlorn river
that stonewalled stonefloored gulch would never leak and already it contained water enough to irrigate the whole altar valley for two dry seasons
yaqui led swiftly along the lake to the upper end where the stream roared down over unscalable walls
this point was the farthest gale had ever penetrated into the rough foothills and he had belding's word for it that no white man had ever climbed no name mountains from the west
but a white man was not an indian
the former might have stolen the range and valley and mountain even the desert but his possessions would ever remain mysteries
gale had scarcely faced the great gray ponderous wall of cliff before the old strange interest in the yaqui seized him again
it recalled the tie that existed between them a tie almost as close as blood
then he was eager and curious to see how the indian would conquer those seemingly insurmountable steps of stone
yaqui left the gulch and clambered up over a jumble of weathered slides and traced a slow course along the base of the giant wall
he looked up and seemed to select a point for ascent
it was the last place in that mountainside where gale would have thought climbing possible
before him the wall rose leaning over him shutting out the light a dark mighty mountain mass
innumerable cracks and crevices and caves roughened the bulging sides of dark rock
yaqui tied one end of his lasso to the short stout stick and carefully disentangling the coils he whirled the stick round and round and threw it almost over the first rim of the shelf perhaps thirty feet up
the stick did not lodge
yaqui tried again
this time it caught in a crack
he pulled hard
then holding to the lasso he walked up the steep slant hand over hand on the rope
when he reached the shelf he motioned for gale to follow
gale found that method of scaling a wall both quick and easy
yaqui pulled up the lasso and threw the stick aloft into another crack
he climbed to another shelf and gale followed him
the third effort brought them to a more rugged bench a hundred feet above the slides
the yaqui worked round to the left and turned into a dark fissure
gale kept close to his heels
they came out presently into lighter space yet one that restricted any extended view
broken sections of cliff were on all sides
here the ascent became toil
gale could distance yaqui going downhill on the climb however he was hard put to it to keep the indian in sight
it was not a question of strength or lightness of foot
these gale had beyond the share of most men
it was a matter of lung power and the yaqui's life had been spent scaling the desert heights
moreover the climbing was infinitely slow tedious dangerous
on the way up several times gale imagined he heard a dull roar of falling water
the sound seemed to be under him over him to this side and to that
when he was certain he could locate the direction from which it came then he heard it no more until he had gone on
gradually he forgot it in the physical sensations of the climb
he burned his hands and knees
he grew hot and wet and winded
his heart thumped so that it hurt and there were instants when his sight was blurred
when at last he had toiled to where the yaqui sat awaiting him upon the rim of that great wall it was none too soon
gale lay back and rested for a while without note of anything except the blue sky
then he sat up
he was amazed to find that after that wonderful climb he was only a thousand feet or so above the valley
judged by the nature of his effort he would have said he had climbed a mile
the village lay beneath him with its new adobe structures and tents and buildings in bright contrast with the older habitations
he saw the green alfalfa fields and belding's white horses looking very small and motionless
he pleased himself by imagining he could pick out blanco sol
then his gaze swept on to the river
indeed he realized now why some one had named it forlorn river
even at this season when it was full of water it had a forlorn aspect
it was doomed to fail out there on the desertdoomed never to mingle with the waters of the gulf
it wound away down the valley growing wider and shallower encroaching more and more on the gray flats until it disappeared on its sad journey toward sonoyta
that vast shimmering sungoverned waste recognized its life only at this flood season and was already with parched tongue and insatiate fire licking and burning up its futile waters
yaqui put a hand on gale's knee
it was a bronzed scarred powerful hand always eloquent of meaning
the indian was listening
his bent head his strange dilating eyes his rigid form and that closepressing hand how these brought back to gale the terrible lonely night hours on the lava
what do you hear yaqui
asked gale
he laughed a little at the mood that had come over him
but the sound of his voice did not break the spell
he did not want to speak again
he yielded to yaqui's subtle nameless influence
he listened himself heard nothing but the scream of an eagle
often he wondered if the indian could hear things that made no sound
yaqui was beyond understanding
whatever the indian had listened to or for presently he satisfied himself and with a grunt that might mean anything he rose and turned away from the rim
gale followed rested now and eager to go on
he saw that the great cliff they had climbed was only a stairway up to the huge looming dark bulk of the plateau above
suddenly he again heard the dull roar of falling water
it seemed to have cleared itself of muffled vibrations
yaqui mounted a little ridge and halted
the next instant gale stood above a bottomless cleft into which a white stream leaped
his astounded gaze swept backward along this narrow swift stream to its end in a dark round boiling pool
it was a huge spring a bubbling well the outcropping of an underground river coming down from the vast plateau above
yaqui had brought gale to the source of forlorn river
flashing thoughts in gale's mind were no swifter than the thrills that ran over him
he would stake out a claim here and never be cheated out of it
ditches on the benches and troughs on the steep walls would carry water down to the valley
ben chase had build a great dam which would be useless if gale chose to turn forlorn river from its natural course
the fountain head of that mysterious desert river belonged to him
his eagerness his mounting passion was checked by yaqui's unusual action
the indian showed wonder hesitation even reluctance
his strange eyes surveyed this boiling well as if they could not believe the sight they saw
gale divined instantly that yaqui had never before seen the source of forlorn river
if he had ever ascended to this plateau probably it had been to some other part for the water was new to him
he stood gazing aloft at peaks at lower ramparts of the mountain and at nearer landmarks of prominence
yaqui seemed at fault
he was not sure of his location
then he strode past the swirling pool of dark water and began to ascend a little slope that led up to a shelving cliff
another object halted the indian
it was a pile of stones weathered crumbled fallen into ruin but still retaining shape enough to prove it had been built there by the hands of men
round and round this the yaqui stalked and his curiosity attested a further uncertainty
it was as if he had come upon something surprising
gale wondered about the pile of stones
had it once been a prospector's claim
ugh
grunted the indian and though his exclamation expressed no satisfaction it surely put an end to doubt
he pointed up to the roof of the sloping yellow shelf of stone
faintly outlined there in red were the imprints of many human hands with fingers spread wide
gale had often seen such paintings on the walls of the desert caverns
manifestly these told yaqui he had come to the spot for which he had aimed
then his actions became swiftand yaqui seldom moved swiftly
the fact impressed gale
the indian searched the level floor under the shelf
he gathered up handfuls of small black stones and thrust them at gale
their weight made gale start and then he trembled
the indian's next move was to pick up a piece of weathered rock and throw it against the wall
it broke
he snatched up parts and showed the broken edges to gale
they contained yellow steaks dull glints faint tracings of green
it was gold
gale found his legs shaking under him and he sat down trying to take all the bits of stone into his lap
his fingers were all thumbs as with knife blade he dug into the black pieces of rock
he found gold
then he stared down the slope down into the valley with its river winding forlornly away into the desert
but he did not see any of that
here was reality as sweet as wonderful as saving as a dream come true
yaqui had led him to a ledge of gold
gale had learned enough about mineral to know that this was a rich strike
all in a second he was speechless with the joy of it
but his mind whirled in thought about this strange and noble indian who seemed never to be able to pay a debt
belding and the poverty that had come to him
nell who had wept over the loss of a spring
laddy who never could ride again
jim lash who swore he would always look after his friend
thorne and mercedes
all these people who had been good to him and whom he loved were poor
but now they would be rich
they would one and all be his partners
he had discovered the source of forlorn river and was rich in water
yaqui had made him rich in gold
gale wanted to rush down the slope down into the valley and tell his wonderful news
suddenly his eyes cleared and he saw the pile of stones
his blood turned to ice then to fire
that was the mark of a prospector's claim
but it was old very old
the ledge had never been worked the slope was wild
there was not another single indication that a prospector had ever been there
where then was he who had first staked this claim
gale wondered with growing hope with the fire easing with the cold passing
the yaqui uttered the low strange involuntary cry so rare with him a cry somehow always associated with death
gale shuddered
the indian was digging in the sand and dust under the shelving wall
he threw out an object that rang against the stone
it was a belt buckle
he threw out old shrunken withered boots
he came upon other things and then he ceased to dig
the grave of desert prospectors
gale had seen more than one
ladd had told him many a story of such gruesome finds
it was grim hard fact
then the keeneyed yaqui reached up to a little projecting shelf of rock and took from it a small object
he showed no curiosity and gave the thing to gale
how strangely gale felt when he received into his hands a flat oblong box
was it only the influence of the yaqui or was there a nameless and unseen presence beside that grave
gale could not be sure
but he knew he had gone back to the old desert mood
he knew something hung in the balance
no accident no luck no debtpaying indian could account wholly for that moment
gale knew he held in his hands more than gold
the box was a tin one and not all rusty
gale pried open the reluctant lid
a faint old musty odor penetrated his nostrils
inside the box lay a packet wrapped in what once might have been oilskin
he took it out and removed this covering
a folded paper remained in his hands
it was growing yellow with age
but he descried a dim tracery of words
a crabbed scrawl written in blood hard to read
he held it more to the light and slowly he deciphered its content
we robert burton and jonas warren give half of this gold claim to the man who finds it and half to nell burton daughter and granddaughter
gasping with a bursting heart overwhelmed by an unutterable joy of divination gale fumbled with the paper until he got it open
it was a certificate twentyone years old and recorded the marriage of robert burton and nellie warren
xx  desert gold  a summer day dawned on forlorn river a beautiful still hot golden day with huge sail clouds of white motionless over no name peaks and the purple of clear air in the distance along the desert horizon
mrs belding returned that day to find her daughter happy and the past buried forever in two lonely graves
the haunting shadow left her eyes
gale believed he would never forget the sweetness the wonder the passion of her embrace when she called him her boy and gave him her blessing
the little wrinkled padre who married gale and nell performed the ceremony as he told his beads without interest or penetration and went his way leaving happiness behind
shore i was a sick man ladd said an' darn near a dead one but i'm agoin' to get well
mebbe i'll be able to ride again someday
nell i lay it to you
an' i'm agoin' to kiss you an' wish you all the joy there is in this world
an' dick as yaqui says she's shore your shower of gold
he spoke of gale's finding lovespoke of it with the deep and wistful feeling of the lonely ranger who had always yearned for love and had never known it
belding once more practical and important as never before with mining projects and water claims to manage spoke of gale's great good fortune in finding of goldhe called it desert gold
ah yes
desert gold
exclaimed dick's father softly with eyes of pride
perhaps he was glad dick had found the rich claim surely he was happy that dick had won the girl he loved
but it seemed to dick himself that his father meant something very different from love and fortune in his allusion to desert gold
that beautiful happy day like life or love itself could not be wholly perfect
yaqui came to dick to say goodby
dick was startled grieved and in his impulsiveness forgot for a moment the nature of the indian
yaqui was not to be changed
belding tried to overload him with gifts
the indian packed a bag of food a blanket a gun a knife a canteen and no more
the whole household went out with him to the corrals and fields from which belding bade him choose a horseany horse even the loved blanco diablo
gale's heart was in his throat for fear the indian might choose blanco sol and gale hated himself for a selfishness he could not help
but without a word he would have parted with the treasured sol
yaqui whistled the horses upfor the last time
did he care for them
it would have been hard to say
he never looked at the fierce and haughty diablo nor at blanco sol as he raised his noble head and rang his piercing blast
the indian did not choose one of belding's whites
he caught a lean and wiry broncho strapped a blanket on him and fastened on the pack
then he turned to these friends the same emotionless inscrutable dark and silent indian that he had always been
this parting was nothing to him
he had stayed to pay a debt and now he was going home
he shook hands with the men swept a dark fleeting glance over nell and rested his strange eyes upon mercedes's beautiful and agitated face
it must have been a moment of intense feeling for the spanish girl
she owed it to him that she had life and love and happiness
she held out those speaking slender hands
but yaqui did not touch them
turning away he mounted the broncho and rode down the trail toward the river
he's going home said belding
home
whispered ladd and dick knew the ranger felt the resurging tide of memory
homeacross the cactus and lava through solemn lonely days the silent lonely nights into the vast and redhazed world of desolation
thorne mercedes nell let's climb the foothill yonder and watch him out of sight said dick
they climbed while the others returned to the house
when they reached the summit of the hill yaqui was riding up the far bank of the river
he will turn to lookto wave goodby
asked nell
dear he is an indian replied gale
from that height they watched him ride through the mesquites up over the river bank to enter the cactus
his mount showed dark against the green and white and for a long time he was plainly in sight
the sun hung red in a golden sky
the last the watchers saw of yaqui was when he rode across a ridge and stood silhouetted against the gold of desert skya wild lonely beautiful picture
then he was gone
strangely it came to gale then that he was glad
yaqui had returned to his ownthe great spaces the desolation the solitudeto the trails he had trodden when a child trails haunted now by ghosts of his people and ever by his gods
gale realized that in the yaqui he had known the spirit of the desert that this spirit had claimed all which was wild and primitive in him
tears glistened in mercedes's magnificent black eyes and thorne kissed them awaykissed the fire back to them and the flame to her cheeks
that action recalled gale's earlier mood the joy of the present and he turned to nell's sweet face
the desert was there wonderful constructive ennobling beautiful terrible but it was not for him as it was for the indian
in the light of nell's tremulous returning smile that strange deep clutching shadow faded lost its hold forever and he leaned close to her whispering lluvia d'oroshower of gold
chapter i  at sunset hour the forest was still lonely sweet with tang of fir and spruce blazing in gold and red and green and the man who glided on under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and disappearing to have become a part of the wild woodland
old baldy highest of the white mountains stood up round and bare rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun
then as the fire dropped behind the domed peak a change a cold and darkening blight passed down the black spearpointed slopes over all that mountain world
it was a wild richly timbered and abundantly watered region of dark forests and grassy parks ten thousand feet above sealevel isolated on all sides by the southern arizona desertthe virgin home of elk and deer of bear and lion of wolf and fox and the birthplace as well as the hidingplace of the fierce apache
september in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze following shortly after sundown
twilight appeared to come on its wings as did faint sounds not distinguishable before in the stillness
milt dale man of the forest halted at the edge of a timbered ridge to listen and to watch
beneath him lay a narrow valley open and grassy from which rose a faint murmur of running water
its music was pierced by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote
from overhead in the giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the night and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild turkeys going to roost
to dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland
he was glad for he had expected to hear the clipclop of white men's horseswhich to hear up in those fastnesses was hateful to him
he and the indian were friends
that fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter
but there hid somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men sheepthieves whom dale did not want to meet
as he started out upon the slope a sudden flaring of the afterglow of sunset flooded down from old baldy filling the valley with lights and shadows yellow and blue like the radiance of the sky
the pools in the curves of the brook shone darkly bright
dale's gaze swept up and down the valley and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook where the wall of spruce stood up its speared and spiked crest against the pale clouds
the wind began to moan in the trees and there was a feeling of rain in the air
dale striking a trail turned his back to the fading afterglow and strode down the valley
with night at hand and a rainstorm brewing he did not head for his own camp some miles distant but directed his steps toward an old log cabin
when he reached it darkness had almost set in
he approached with caution
this cabin like the few others scattered in the valleys might harbor indians or a bear or a panther
nothing however appeared to be there
then dale studied the clouds driving across the sky and he felt the cool dampness of a fine misty rain on his face
it would rain off and on during the night
whereupon he entered the cabin
and the next moment he heard quick hoofbeats of trotting horses
peering out he saw dim moving forms in the darkness quite close at hand
they had approached against the wind so that sound had been deadened
five horses with riders dale made outsaw them loom close
then he heard rough voices
quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a ladder he knew led to a loft and finding it he quickly mounted taking care not to make a noise with his rifle and lay down upon the floor of brush and poles
scarcely had he done so when heavy steps with accompaniment of clinking spurs passed through the door below into the cabin
wal beasley are you here queried a loud voice
there was no reply
the man below growled under his breath and again the spurs jingled
fellars beasley ain't here yet he called
put the hosses under the shed
we'll wait  wait huh came a harsh reply
mebbe all nightan' we got nuthin' to eat  shut up moze
reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'
put them hosses away an' some of you rustle firewood in here  low muttered curses then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses
another shuffling clinking footstep entered the cabin
snake it'd been sense to fetch a pack along drawled this newcomer
reckon so jim
but we didn't an' what's the use hollerin'
beasley won't keep us waitin' long  dale lying still and prone felt a slow start in all his blooda thrilling wave
that deepvoiced man below was snake anson the worst and most dangerous character of the region and the others undoubtedly composed his gang long notorious in that sparsely settled country
and the beasley mentionedhe was one of the two biggest ranchers and sheepraisers of the white mountain ranges
what was the meaning of a rendezvous between snake anson and beasley
milt dale answered that question to beasley's discredit and many strange matters pertaining to sheep and herders always a mystery to the little village of pine now became as clear as daylight
other men entered the cabin
it ain't agoin' to rain much said one
then came a crash of wood thrown to the ground
jim hyar's a chunk of pine log dry as punk said another
rustlings and slow footsteps and then heavy thuds attested to the probability that jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured
snake lemme your pipe an' i'll hev a fire in a jiffy  wal i want my terbacco an' i ain't carin' about no fire replied snake
reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods drawled jim
sharp click of steel on flintmany timesand then a sound of hard blowing and sputtering told of jim's efforts to start a fire
presently the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed there came a little crackling of wood and the rustle of flame and then a steady growing roar
as it chanced dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft and right near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs
when the fire blazed up he was fairly well able to see the men below
the only one he had ever seen was jim wilson who had been well known at pine before snake anson had ever been heard of
jim was the best of a bad lot and he had friends among the honest people
it was rumored that he and snake did not pull well together
fire feels good said the burly moze who appeared as broad as he was blackvisaged
fall's sure acomin' now if only we had some grub  moze there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddlebag an' if you git it you can have half spoke up another voice
moze shuffled out with alacrity
in the firelight snake anson's face looked lean and serpentlike his eyes glittered and his long neck and all of his long length carried out the analogy of his name
snake what's this here deal with beasley inquired jim
reckon you'll l'arn when i do replied the leader
he appeared tired and thoughtful
ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herdersfor nothin' queried the youngest of the gang a boy in years whose hard bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades
you're dead right burtan' that's my stand replied the man who had sent moze out
snake snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before long said jim wilson
are we goin' to winter down in the tonto basin or over on the gila  reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south replied snake gruffly
at the juncture moze returned
boss i heerd a hoss comin' up the trail he said
snake rose and stood at the door listening
outside the wind moaned fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin
ahuh exclaimed snake in relief
silence ensued then for a moment at the end of which interval dale heard a rapid clipclop on the rocky trail outside
the men below shuffled uneasily but none of them spoke
the fire cracked cheerily
snake anson stepped back from before the door with an action that expressed both doubt and caution
the trotting horse had halted out there somewhere
ho there inside called a voice from the darkness
ho yourself replied anson
that you snake quickly followed the query
reckon so returned anson showing himself
the newcomer entered
he was a large man wearing a slicker that shone wet in the firelight
his sombrero pulled well down shadowed his face so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked
he had a black drooping mustache and a chin like a rock
a potential force matured and powerful seemed to be wrapped in his movements
hullo snake
hullo wilson he said
i've backed out on the other deal
sent for you onon another little matter particular private  here he indicated with a significant gesture that snake's men were to leave the cabin
ahuh
ejaculated anson dubiously
then he turned abruptly
moze you an' shady an' burt go wait outside
reckon this ain't the deal i expected an' you can saddle the hosses  the three members of the gang filed out all glancing keenly at the stranger who had moved back into the shadow
all right now beasley said anson lowvoiced
what's your game
jim here is in on my deals  then beasley came forward to the fire stretching his hands to the blaze
nothin' to do with sheep replied he
wal i reckoned not assented the other
an' saywhatever your game is i ain't likin' the way you kept me waitin' an' ridin' around
we waited near all day at big spring
then thet greaser rode up an' sent us here
we're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets  i won't keep you long said beasley
but even if i did you'd not mindwhen i tell you this deal concerns al auchinclossthe man who made an outlaw of you  anson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame
wilson likewise bent forward eagerly
beasley glanced at the doorthen began to whisper
old auchincloss is on his last legs
he's goin' to croak
he's sent back to missouri for a niecea young girlan' he means to leave his ranches an' sheepall his stock to her
seems he has no one else
them ranchesan' all them sheep an' hosses
you know me an' al were pardners in sheepraisin' for years
he swore i cheated him an' he threw me out
an' all these years i've been swearin' he did me dirtowed me sheep an' money
i've got as many friends in pinean' all the way down the trailas auchincloss has an' snake see here  he paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the blaze
anson leaned forward like a serpent ready to strike and jim wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand
see here panted beasley
the girl's due to arrive at magdalena on the sixteenth
that's a week from tomorrow
she'll take the stage to snowdrop where some of auchincloss's men will meet her with a team  ahuh grunted anson as beasley halted again
an' what of all thet  she mustn't never get as far as snowdrop  you want me to hold up the stagean' get the girl  exactly  walan' what then  make off with her she disappears
that's your affair

i'll press my claims on auchinclosshound himan' be ready when he croaks to take over his property
then the girl can come back for all i care you an' wilson fix up the deal between you
if you have to let the gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what
this 'll make you a rich stake
an' providin' when it's paid you strike for new territory  thet might be wise muttered snake anson
beasley the weak point in your game is the uncertainty of life
old al is tough
he may fool you  auchincloss is a dyin' man declared beasley with such positiveness that it could not be doubted
wal he sure wasn't plumb hearty when i last seen him beasley in case i play your gamehow'm i to know that girl  her name's helen rayner replied beasley eagerly
she's twenty years old
all of them auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the handsomest  ahuh
beasley this 's sure a bigger dealan' one i ain't fancyin'
but i never doubted your word come onan' talk out
what's in it for me  don't let any one in on this
you two can hold up the stage
why it was never held up
but you want to mask how about ten thousand sheepor what they bring at phenix in gold  jim wilson whistled low
an' leave for new territory repeated snake anson under his breath
you've said it  wal i ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal but you can count on me september sixteenth at magdalenaan' her name's helenan' she's handsome  yes
my herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks
later if the weather holds good send me word by one of them an' i'll meet you  beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze pulled on his gloves and pulled down his sombrero and with an abrupt word of parting strode out into the night
jim what do you make of him queried snake anson
pard he's got us beat two ways for sunday replied wilson
ahuh
wal let's get back to camp and he led the way out
low voices drifted into the cabin then came snorts of horses and striking hoofs and after that a steady trot gradually ceasing
once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest stillness
chapter ii  milt dale quietly sat up to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the gloom
he was thirty years old
as a boy of fourteen he had run off from his school and home in iowa and joining a wagontrain of pioneers he was one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the white mountains
but he had not taken kindly to farming or sheepraising or monotonous home toil and for twelve years he had lived in the forest with only infrequent visits to pine and show down and snowdrop
this wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for the villagers for he did care and he was welcome everywhere but that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive instinctive force of a savage
and on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a friend
that man beasley he soliloquized
beasleyin cahoots with snake anson
well he was right
al auchincloss is on his last legs
poor old man
when i tell him he'll never believe me that's sure  discovery of the plot meant to dale that he must hurry down to pine
a girlhelen raynertwenty years old he mused
beasley wants her made off with that meansworse than killed  dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore
bad men worked their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer
he had shot wolves for that trick
with men good or bad he had not clashed
old women and children appealed to him but he had never had any interest in girls
the image then of this helen rayner came strangely to dale and he suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent beasley not to befriend old al auchincloss but for the sake of the girl
probably she was already on her way west alone eager hopeful of a future home
how little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end
many trails ended abruptly in the forestand only trained woodsmen could read the tragedy
strange how i cut across country today from spruce swamp reflected dale
circumstances movements usually were not strange to him
his methods and habits were seldom changed by chance
the matter then of his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason and of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl was indeed an adventure to provoke thought
it provoked more for dale grew conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins
he who had little to do with the strife of men and nothing to do with anger felt his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl
old al won't listen to me pondered dale
an' even if he did he wouldn't believe me
maybe nobody will all the same snake anson won't get that girl  with these last words dale satisfied himself of his own position and his pondering ceased
taking his rifle he descended from the loft and peered out of the door
the night had grown darker windier cooler broken clouds were scudding across the sky only a few stars showed fine rain was blowing from the northwest and the forest seemed full of a low dull roar
reckon i'd better hang up here he said and turned to the fire
the coals were red now
from the depths of his huntingcoat he procured a little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat
these strips he laid for a moment on the hot embers until they began to sizzle and curl then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter grateful for little
he sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing glowing golden embers
outside the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased to a roar
dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him drowsily lulling and he heard the stormwind in the trees now like a waterfall and anon like a retreating army and again low and sad and he saw pictures in the glowing embers strange as dreams
presently he rose and climbing to the loft he stretched himself out and soon fell asleep
when the gray dawn broke he was on his way 'crosscountry to the village of pine
during the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased
a suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places
all was graythe parks the gladesand deeper darker gray marked the aisles of the forest
shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent with spectral forms
then the east kindled the gray lightened the dreaming woodland awoke to the farreaching rays of a bursting red sun
this was always the happiest moment of dale's lonely days as sunset was his saddest
he responded and there was something in his blood that answered the whistle of a stag from a nearby ridge
his strides were long noiseless and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the dewladen grass
dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest climbing but the senacasthose parklike meadows so named by mexican sheepherderswere as round and level as if they had been made by man in beautiful contrast to the darkgreen rough and rugged ridges
both open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance of game
the cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the spruces a round black lumbering object a twittering in the brush and stealthy steps were all easy signs for dale to read
once as he noiselessly emerged into a little glade he espied a red fox stalking some quarry which as he advanced proved to be a flock of partridges
they whirred up brushing the branches and the fox trotted away
in every senaca dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the high grass
it had always been his custom on his visits to pine to kill and pack fresh meat down to several old friends who were glad to give him lodging
and hurried though he was now he did not intend to make an exception of this trip
at length he got down into the pine belt where the great gnarled yellow trees soared aloft stately and aloof from one another and the ground was a brown odorous springy mat of pineneedles level as a floor
squirrels watched him from all around scurrying away at his near approachtiny brown lightstriped squirrels and larger ones russetcolored and the splendid darkgrays with their white bushy tails and plumed ears
this belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide gray rolling open land almost like a prairie with foothills lifting near and far and the redgold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun
here dale flushed a flock of wild turkeys upward of forty in number and their subdued color of gray flecked with white and graceful sleek build showed them to be hens
there was not a gobbler in the flock
they began to run pellmell out into the grass until only their heads appeared bobbing along and finally disappeared
dale caught a glimpse of skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys and as they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the hindmost
his bullet struck low as he had meant it to but too low and the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pineneedles thrown up into his face
this frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt into a tree rolled over gained his feet and then the cover of the forest
dale was amused at this
his hand was against all the predatory beasts of the forest though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the gentle beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed
but some he loved better than others and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty
he crossed the wide grassy plain and struck another gradual descent where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm sunlighted glades bordered along a sparkling brook
here he heard a turkey gobble and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching silent detour around a clump of aspens
in a sunny patch of grass a dozen or more big gobblers stood all suspiciously facing in his direction heads erect with that wild aspect peculiar to their species
old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk
dale shot two of them
the others began to run like ostriches thudding over the ground spreading their wings and with that running start launched their heavy bodies into whirring flight
they flew low at about the height of a man from the grass and vanished in the woods
dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way
soon he came to a break in the forest level from which he gazed down a leaguelong slope of pine and cedar out upon the bare glistening desert stretching away endlessly rolling out to the dim dark horizon line
the little hamlet of pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered forest
a road running parallel with a darkwatered swiftflowing stream divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue smoke drifted lazily aloft
fields of corn and fields of oats yellow in the sunlight surrounded the village and green pastures dotted with horses and cattle reached away to the denser woodland
this site appeared to be a natural clearing for there was no evidence of cut timber
the scene was rather too wild to be pastoral but it was serene tranquil giving the impression of a remote community prosperous and happy drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives
dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden bordered with sunflowers
his call was answered by an old woman gray and bent but remarkably spry who appeared at the door
why land's sakes if it ain't milt dale she exclaimed in welcome
reckon it's me mrs cass he replied
an' i've brought you a turkey  milt you're that good boy who never forgits old widow cass what a gobbler
first one i've seen this fall
my man tom used to fetch home gobblers like that an' mebbe he'll come home again sometime  her husband tom cass had gone into the forest years before and had never returned
but the old woman always looked for him and never gave up hope
men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back replied dale as he had said to her many a time
come right in
you air hungry i know
now son when last did you eat a fresh egg or a flapjack  you should remember he answered laughing as he followed her into a small clean kitchen
lawsa'me
an' thet's months ago she replied shaking her gray head
milt you should give up that wild lifean' marryan' have a home  you always tell me that  yes an' i'll see you do it yet now you set there an' pretty soon i'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water  what's the news auntie he asked
nary news in this dead place
why nobody's been to snowdrop in two weeks
sary jones died poor old soulshe's better offan' one of my cows run away
milt she's wild when she gits loose in the woods
an' you'll have to track her 'cause nobody else can
an' john dakker's heifer was killed by a lion an' lem harden's fast hossyou know his favoritewas stole by hossthieves
lem is jest crazy
an' that reminds me milt where's your big ranger thet you'd never sell or lend  my horses are up in the woods auntie safe i reckon from horsethieves  well that's a blessin'
we've had some stock stole this summer milt an' no mistake  thus while preparing a meal for dale the old woman went on recounting all that had happened in the little village since his last visit
dale enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy and it was exceedingly good to sit at her table
in his opinion nowhere else could there have been such butter and cream such ham and eggs
besides she always had apple pie it seemed at any time he happened in and apple pie was one of dale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest
how's old al auchincloss presently inquired dale
poorlypoorly sighed mrs cass
but he tramps an' rides around same as ever
al's not long for this world an' milt that reminds methere's the biggest news you ever heard  you don't say so exclaimed dale to encourage the excited old woman
al has sent back to saint joe for his niece helen rayner
she's to inherit all his property
we've heard much of hera purty lass they say now milt dale here's your chance
stay out of the woods an' go to work you can marry that girl  no chance for me auntie replied dale smiling
the old woman snorted
much you know
any girl would have you milt dale if you'd only throw a kerchief  me
an' why auntie he queried half amused half thoughtful
when he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the ideas of people
why
i declare milt you live so in the woods you're like a boy of tenan' then sometimes as old as the hills
there's no young man to compare with you hereabouts
an' this girlshe'll have all the spunk of the auchinclosses  then maybe she'd not be such a catch after all replied dale
wal you've no cause to love them that's sure
but milt the auchincloss women are always good wives  dear auntie you're dreamin' said dale soberly
i want no wife
i'm happy in the woods  air you goin' to live like an injun all your days milt dale she queried sharply
i hope so  you ought to be ashamed
but some lass will change you boy an' mebbe it'll be this helen rayner
i hope an' pray so to thet  auntie supposin' she did change me
she'd never change old al
he hates me you know  wal i ain't so sure milt
i met al the other day
he inquired for you an' said you was wild but he reckoned men like you was good for pioneer settlements
lord knows the good turns you've done this village
milt old al doesn't approve of your wild life but he never had no hard feelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep  auntie i don't believe tom ever killed al's sheep declared dale positively
wal al thinks so an' many other people replied mrs cass shaking her gray head doubtfully
you never swore he didn't
an' there was them two sheepherders who did swear they seen him  they only saw a cougar
an' they were so scared they ran  who wouldn't
thet big beast is enough to scare any one
for land's sakes don't ever fetch him down here again
i'll never forgit the time you did
all the folks an' children an' hosses in pine broke an' run thet day  yes but tom wasn't to blame
auntie he's the tamest of my pets
didn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand  wal milt i ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a lot of people i know
fer he did
but the looks of him an' what's been said was enough for me  an' what's all that auntie  they say he's wild when out of your sight
an' thet he'd trail an' kill anythin' you put him after  i trained him to be just that way  wal leave tom to home up in the woodswhen you visit us  dale finished his hearty meal and listened awhile longer to the old woman's talk then taking his rifle and the other turkey he bade her goodby
she followed him out
now milt you'll come soon again won't youjest to see al's niecewho'll be here in a week  i reckon i'll drop in some day auntie have you seen my friends the mormon boys  no i 'ain't seen them an' don't want to she retorted
milt dale if any one ever corrals you it'll be mormons  don't worry auntie
i like those boys
they often see me up in the woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh meat  they're workin' for beasley now  is that so rejoined dale with a sudden start
an' what doin'  beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence an' didn't have enough help so i hear  beasley gettin' rich repeated dale thoughtfully
more sheep an' horses an' cattle than ever i reckon  lawsa'me
why milt beasley 'ain't any idea what he owns
yes he's the biggest man in these parts since poor old al's took to failin'
i reckon al's health ain't none improved by beasley's success
they've bad some bitter quarrels latelyso i hear
al ain't what he was  dale bade goodby again to his old friend and strode away thoughtful and serious
beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent but he would be dangerous to oppose
there did not appear much doubt of his driving his way roughshod to the dominance of affairs there in pine
dale passing down the road began to meet acquaintances who had hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings so that his pondering was interrupted for the time being
he carried the turkey to another old friend and when he left her house he went on to the village store
this was a large log cabin roughly covered with clapboards with a wide plank platform in front and a hitchingrail in the road
several horses were standing there and a group of lazy shirtsleeved loungers
i'll be doggoned if it ain't milt dale exclaimed one
howdy milt old buckskin
right down glad to see you greeted another
hello dale
you air shore good for sore eyes drawled still another
after a long period of absence dale always experienced a singular warmth of feeling when he met these acquaintances
it faded quickly when he got back to the intimacy of his woodland and that was because the people of pine with few exceptionsthough they liked him and greatly admired his outdoor wisdomregarded him as a sort of nonentity
because he loved the wild and preferred it to village and range life they had classed him as not one of them
some believed him lazy others believed him shiftless others thought him an indian in mind and habits and there were many who called him slowwitted
then there was another side to their regard for him which always afforded him goodnatured amusement
two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison another wanted to hunt with him
lem harden came out of the store and appealed to dale to recover his stolen horse
lem's brother wanted a wildrunning mare tracked and brought home
jesse lyons wanted a colt broken and broken with patience not violence as was the method of the hardriding boys at pine
so one and all they besieged dale with their selfish needs all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures
and on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks as they entered the store bore strong testimony to dale's personality
if there ain't milt dale exclaimed the older of the two
how lucky
my cow's sick an' the men are no good doctorin'
i'll jest ask milt over  no one like milt responded the other woman heartily
good day thereyou milt dale called the first speaker
when you git away from these lazy men come over  dale never refused a service and that was why his infrequent visits to pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure
presently beasley strode down the street and when about to enter the store he espied dale
hullo there milt he called cordially as he came forward with extended hand
his greeting was sincere but the lightning glance he shot over dale was not born of his pleasure
seen in daylight beasley was a big bold bluff man with strong dark features
his aggressive presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy
dale shook hands with him
how are you beasley  ain't complainin' milt though i got more work than i can rustle
reckon you wouldn't take a job bossin' my sheepherders  reckon i wouldn't replied dale
thanks all the same  what's goin' on up in the woods  plenty of turkey an' deer
lots of bear too
the indians have worked back on the south side early this fall
but i reckon winter will come late an' be mild  good
an' where 're you headin' from  'crosscountry from my camp replied dale rather evasively
your camp
nobody ever found that yet declared beasley gruffly
it's up there said dale
reckon you've got that cougar chained in your cabin door queried beasley and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular frame
also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes
tom ain't chained
an' i haven't no cabin beasley  you mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein' hogtied or corralled demanded beasley
sure he does  beats me
but then i'm queer on cougars
have had many a cougar trail me at night
ain't sayin' i was scared
but i don't care for that brand of varmint milt you goin' to stay down awhile  yes i'll hang around some  come over to the ranch
glad to see you any time
some old huntin' pards of yours are workin' for me  thanks beasley
i reckon i'll come over  beasley turned away and took a step and then as if with an afterthought he wheeled again
suppose you've heard about old al auchincloss bein' near petered out  queried beasley
a strong ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate from his features
dale divined that beasley's next step would be to further his advancement by some word or hint
widow cass was tellin' me all the news
too bad about old al replied dale
sure is
he's done for
an' i'm sorrythough al's never been square  beasley interrupted dale quickly you can't say that to me
al auchincloss always was the whitest an' squarest man in this sheep country  beasley gave dale a fleeting dark glance
dale what you think ain't goin' to influence feelin' on this range  returned beasley deliberately
you live in the woods an'  reckon livin' in the woods i might thinkan' know a whole lot  interposed dale just as deliberately
the group of men exchanged surprised glances
this was milt dale in different aspect
and beasley did not conceal a puzzled surprise
about whatnow he asked bluntly
why about what's goin' on in pine replied dale
some of the men laughed
shore lots goin' onan' no mistake put in lem harden
probably the keen beasley had never before considered milt dale as a responsible person certainly never one in any way to cross his trail
but on the instant perhaps some instinct was born or he divined an antagonism in dale that was both surprising and perplexing
dale i've differences with al auchinclosshave had them for years  said beasley
much of what he owns is mine
an' it's goin' to come to me
now i reckon people will be takin' sidessome for me an' some for al
most are for me where do you stand
al auchincloss never had no use for you an' besides he's a dyin' man
are you goin' on his side  yes i reckon i am  wal i'm glad you've declared yourself rejoined beasley shortly and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any obstacle from his path
milt thet's badmakin' beasley sore at you said lem harden
he's on the way to boss this outfit  he's sure goin' to step into al's boots said another
thet was white of milt to stick up fer poor old al declared lem's brother
dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road
the burden of what he knew about beasley weighed less heavily upon him and the closelipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest
he needed to think before undertaking to call upon old al auchincloss and to that end he sought an hour's seclusion under the pines
chapter iii  in the afternoon dale having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him by his old friends at pine directed slow steps toward the auchincloss ranch
the flat square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon a little hill half a mile out of the village
a home as well as a fort it had been the first structure erected in that region and the process of building had more than once been interrupted by indian attacks
the apaches had for some time however confined their fierce raids to points south of the white mountain range
auchincloss's house looked down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes and hundreds of acres of wellcultivated soil
fields of oats waved gray and yellow in the afternoon sun an immense green pasture was divided by a willowbordered brook and here were droves of horses and out on the rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle
the whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of man
the brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the village
water for the house however came down from the high wooded slope of the mountain and had been brought there by a simple expedient
pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end with a deep trough cut in them and they made a shining line down the slope across the valley and up the little hill to the auchincloss home
near the house the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together making a crude pipe
water ran uphill in this case one of the facts that made the ranch famous as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small boys of pine
the two good women who managed auchincloss's large household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into their kitchen with the everflowing stream of clear cold mountain water
as it happened this day dale encountered al auchincloss sitting in the shade of a porch talking to some of his sheepherders and stockmen
auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width of shoulder
he had no gray hairs and he did not look old yet there was in his face a certain weariness something that resembled sloping lines of distress dim and pale that told of age and the ebbtide of vitality
his features cast in large mold were cleancut and comely and he had frank blue eyes somewhat sad yet still full of spirit
dale had no idea how his visit would be taken and he certainly would not have been surprised to be ordered off the place
he had not set foot there for years
therefore it was with surprise that he saw auchincloss wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular expression
howdy al
how are you greeted dale easily as he leaned his rifle against the log wall
auchincloss did not rise but he offered his hand
wal milt dale i reckon this is the first time i ever seen you that i couldn't lay you flat on your back replied the rancher
his tone was both testy and full of pathos
i take it you mean you ain't very well replied dale
i'm sorry al  no it ain't thet
never was sick in my life
i'm just played out like a hoss thet had been strong an' willin' an' did too much wal you don't look a day older milt
livin' in the woods rolls over a man's head  yes i'm feelin' fine an' time never bothers me  wal mebbe you ain't such a fool after all
i've wondered latelysince i had time to think
but milt you don't git no richer  al i have all i want an' need  wal then you don't support anybody you don't do any good in the world  we don't agree al replied dale with his slow smile
reckon we never did an' you jest come over to pay your respects to me eh  not altogether answered dale ponderingly
first off i'd like to say i'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed  you will
an' how'd you go about that  wasn't very many sheep was there
a matter of fifty head  so many
al do you still think old tom killed them sheep  humph
milt i know damn well he did  al now how could you know somethin' i don't
be reasonable now
let's don't fall out about this again
i'll pay back the sheep
work it out  milt dale you'll come down here an' work out that fifty head of sheep ejaculated the old rancher incredulously
sure  wal i'll be damned he sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at dale
what's got into you milt
hev you heard about my niece thet's comin' an' think you'll shine up to her  yes al her comin' has a good deal to do with my deal replied dale soberly
but i never thought to shine up to her as you hint  haw
haw
you're just like all the other colts hereabouts
reckon it's a good sign too
it'll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods
but boy this niece of mine helen rayner will stand you on your head
i never seen her
they say she's jest like her mother
an' nell auchinclosswhat a girl she was  dale felt his face grow red
indeed this was strange conversation for him
honest al he began
son don't lie to an old man  lie
i wouldn't lie to any one
al it's only men who live in towns an' are always makin' deals
i live in the forest where there's nothin' to make me lie  wal no offense meant i'm sure responded auchincloss
an' mebbe there's somethin' in what you say we was talkin' about them sheep your big cat killed
wal milt i can't prove it that's sure
an' mebbe you'll think me doddery when i tell you my reason
it wasn't what them greaser herders said about seein' a cougar in the herd  what was it then queried dale much interested
wal thet day a year ago i seen your pet
he was lyin' in front of the store an' you was inside tradin' fer supplies i reckon
it was like meetin' an enemy face to face
because damn me if i didn't know that cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes
there  the old rancher expected to be laughed at
but dale was grave
al i know how you felt he replied as if they were discussing an action of a human being
sure i'd hate to doubt old tom
but he's a cougar
an' the ways of animals are strange
anyway al i'll make good the loss of your sheep  no you won't rejoined auchincloss quickly
we'll call it off
i'm takin' it square of you to make the offer
thet's enough
so forget your worry about work if you had any  there's somethin' else al i wanted to say began dale with hesitation
an' it's about beasley  auchincloss started violently and a flame of red shot into his face
then he raised a big hand that shook
dale saw in a flash how the old man's nerves had gone
don't mentionthetthet greaserto me burst out the rancher
it makes me seered dale i ain't overlookin' that you spoke up fer me todaystood fer my side
lem harden told me
i was glad
an' thet's whytodayi forgot our old quarrel
but not a word about thet sheepthiefor i'll drive you off the place  but albe reasonable remonstrated dale
it's necessary thet i speak ofof beasley  it ain't
not to me
i won't listen  reckon you'll have to al returned dale
beasley's after your property
he's made a deal  by heaven
i know that shouted auchincloss tottering up with his face now blackred
do you think thet's new to me
shut up dale
i can't stand it  but althere's worse went on dale hurriedly
worse
your life's threatenedan' your niece helenshe's to be  shut upan' clear out roared auchincloss waving his huge fists
he seemed on the verge of a collapse as shaking all over he backed into the door
a few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful old man
but ali'm your friend began dale appealingly
friend hey returned the rancher with grim bitter passion
then you're the only one milt dale i'm rich an' i'm a dyin' man
i trust nobody
but you wild hunterif you're my friendprove it
go kill thet greaser sheepthief
do somethin'an' then come talk to me  with that he lurched half falling into the house and slammed the door
dale stood there for a blank moment and then taking up his rifle he strode away
toward sunset dale located the camp of his four mormon friends and reached it in time for supper
john roy joe and hal beeman were sons of a pioneer mormon who had settled the little community of snowdrop
they were young men in years but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured
only a year's difference in age stood between john and roy and between roy and joe and likewise joe and hal
when it came to appearance they were difficult to distinguish from one another
horsemen sheepherders cattleraisers huntersthey all possessed long wiry powerful frames lean bronzed still faces and the quiet keen eyes of men used to the open
their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens some three miles from pine and though working for beasley near the village they had ridden to and fro from camp after the habit of seclusion peculiar to their kind
dale and the brothers had much in common and a warm regard had sprang up
but their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things pertaining to the forest
dale ate supper with them and talked as usual when he met them without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his mind
after the meal he helped joe round up the horses hobble them for the night and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines
later when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind and the campfire glowed comfortably dale broached the subject that possessed him
an' so you're working for beasley he queried by way of starting conversation
we was drawled john
but today bein' the end of our month we got our pay an' quit
beasley sure was sore  why'd you knock off  john essayed no reply and his brothers all had that quiet suppressed look of knowledge under restraint
listen to what i come to tell you then you'll talk went on dale
and hurriedly he told of beasley's plot to abduct al auchincloss's niece and claim the dying man's property
when dale ended rather breathlessly the mormon boys sat without any show of surprise or feeling
john the eldest took up a stick and slowly poked the red embers of the fire making the white sparks fly
now milt why'd you tell us thet he asked guardedly
you're the only friends i've got replied dale
it didn't seem safe for me to talk down in the village
i thought of you boys right off
i ain't goin' to let snake anson get that girl
an' i need help so i come to you  beasley's strong around pine an' old al's weakenin'
beasley will git the property girl or no girl said john
things don't always turn out as they look
but no matter about that
the girl deal is what riled me she's to arrive at magdalena on the sixteenth an' take stage for snowdrop now what to do
if she travels on that stage i'll be on it you bet
but she oughtn't to be in it at all

boys somehow i'm goin' to save her
will you help me
i reckon i've been in some tight corners for you
sure this 's different
but are you my friends
you know now what beasley is
an' you're all lost at the hands of snake anson's gang
you've got fast hosses eyes for trackin' an' you can handle a rifle
you're the kind of fellows i'd want in a tight pinch with a bad gang
will you stand by me or see me go alone  then john beeman silently and with pale face gave dale's hand a powerful grip and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise
their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered around their thin lips
milt mebbe we know what beasley is better 'n you said john at length
he ruined my father
he's cheated other mormons
we boys have proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep anson's gang steals an' drives the herds to phenix
our people won't let us accuse beasley
so we've suffered in silence
my father always said let some one else say the first word against beasley an' you've come to us  roy beeman put a hand on dale's shoulder
he perhaps was the keenest of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most
he had been oftenest with dale on many a long trail and he was the hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country
an' we're goin' with you he said in a strong and rolling voice
they resumed their seats before the fire
john threw on more wood and with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up fanned by the wind
as twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a roar
a pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries
the five young men conversed long and earnestly considering planning rejecting ideas advanced by each
dale and roy beeman suggested most of what became acceptable to all
hunters of their type resembled explorers in slow and deliberate attention to details
what they had to deal with here was a situation of unlimited possibilities the horses and outfit needed a long detour to reach magdalena unobserved the rescue of a strange girl who would no doubt be selfwilled and determined to ride on the stagethe rescue forcible if necessary the fight and the inevitable pursuit the flight into the forest and the safe delivery of the girl to auchincloss
then milt will we go after beasley queried roy beeman significantly
dale was silent and thoughtful
sufficient unto the day said john
an' fellars let's go to bed  they rolled out their tarpaulins dale sharing roy's blankets and soon were asleep while the red embers slowly faded and the great roar of wind died down and the forest stillness set in
chapter iv  helen rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twentyfour hours before she made an alarming discovery
accompanied by her sister bo a precocious girl of sixteen helen had left st joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at home yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life in the far west
all her people had the pioneer spirit love of change action adventure was in her blood
then duty to a widowed mother with a large and growing family had called to helen to accept this rich uncle's offer
she had taught school and also her little brothers and sisters she had helped along in other ways
and now though the tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard this opportunity was irresistible in its call
the prayer of her dreams had been answered
to bring good fortune to her family to take care of this beautiful wild little sister to leave the yellow sordid humdrum towns for the great rolling boundless open to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day to be her own to have fulfilled a deep instinctive and undeveloped love of horses cattle sheep of desert and mountain of trees and brooks and wild flowersall this was the sum of her most passionate longings now in some marvelous fairylike way to come true
a check to her happy anticipations a blank sickening dash of cold water upon her warm and intimate dreams had been the discovery that harve riggs was on the train
his presence could mean only one thingthat he had followed her
riggs had been the worst of many sore trials back there in st joseph
he had possessed some claim or influence upon her mother who favored his offer of marriage to helen he was neither attractive nor good nor industrious nor anything that interested her he was the boastful strutting adventurer not genuinely western and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety
helen had suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be badas western men were bad
but on the train in the station at la junta one glimpse of him manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of her sight warned helen that she now might have a problem on her hands
the recognition sobered her
all was not to be a road of roses to this new home in the west
riggs would follow her if he could not accompany her and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything
helen felt the startling realization of being cast upon her own resources and then a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness
but these feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her temper
opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to it
she would not have been al auchincloss's niece if she had faltered
and when temper was succeeded by genuine anger she could have laughed to scorn this harve riggs and his schemes whatever they were
once and for all she dismissed fear of him
when she left st joseph she had faced the west with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of that west
homes had to be made out there in that far country so uncle al had written and women were needed to make homes
she meant to be one of these women and to make of her sister another
and with the thought that she would know definitely what to say to riggs when he approached her sooner or later helen dismissed him from mind
while the train was in motion enabling helen to watch the everchanging scenery and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping bo well in hand at stations she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests and the red rocky gullies and the dim bold mountains
she saw the sun set over distant ranges of new mexicoa golden blaze of glory as new to her as the strange fancies born in her thrilling and fleeting by
bo's raptures were not silent and the instant the sun sank and the color faded she just as rapturously importuned helen to get out the huge basket of food they had brought from home
they had two seats facing each other at the end of the coach and piled there with the basket on top was luggage that constituted all the girls owned in the world
indeed it was very much more than they had ever owned before because their mother in her care for them and desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle had spent money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes
the girls sat together with the heavy basket on their knees and ate while they gazed out at the cool dark ridges
the train clattered slowly on apparently over a road that was all curves
and it was suppertime for everybody in that crowded coach
if helen had not been so absorbed by the great wild mountainland she would have had more interest in the passengers
as it was she saw them and was amused and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car all middleclass people poor and hopeful traveling out there to the new west to find homes
it was splendid and beautiful this fact yet it inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness
from the train window that world of forest and crag with its long bare reaches between seemed so lonely so wild so unlivable
how endless the distance
for hours and miles upon miles no house no hut no indian tepee
it was amazing the length and breadth of this beautiful land
and helen who loved brooks and running streams saw no water at all
then darkness settled down over the slowmoving panorama a cool night wind blew in at the window white stars began to blink out of the blue
the sisters with hands clasped and heads nestled together went to sleep under a heavy cloak
early the next morning while the girls were again delving into their apparently bottomless basket the train stopped at las vegas
look
look cried bo in thrilling voice
cowboys
oh nell look  helen laughing looked first at her sister and thought how most of all she was good to look at
bo was little instinct with pulsating life and she had chestnut hair and darkblue eyes
these eyes were flashing roguish and they drew like magnets
outside on the rude station platform were railroad men mexicans and a group of lounging cowboys
long lean bowlegged fellows they were with young frank faces and intent eyes
one of them seemed particularly attractive with his superb build his redbronze face and brightred scarf his swinging gun and the huge long curved spurs
evidently he caught bo's admiring gaze for with a word to his companions he sauntered toward the window where the girls sat
his gait was singular almost awkward as if he was not accustomed to walking
the long spurs jingled musically
he removed his sombrero and stood at ease frank cool smiling
helen liked him on sight and looking to see what effect he had upon bo she found that young lady staring frightened stiff
good mawnin' drawled the cowboy with slow goodhumored smile
now where might youall be travelin'  the sound of his voice the cleancut and droll geniality seemed new and delightful to helen
we go to magdalenathen take stage for the white mountains replied helen
the cowboy's still intent eyes showed surprise
apache country miss he said
i reckon i'm sorry
thet's shore no place for youall beggin' your pawdinyou ain't mormons  no
we're nieces of al auchincloss rejoined helen
wal you don't say
i've been down magdalena way an' heerd of al reckon you're goin' avisitin'  it's to be home for us  shore thet's fine
the west needs girls
yes i've heerd of al
an old arizona cattleman in a sheep country
thet's bad now i'm wonderin'if i'd drift down there an' ask him for a job ridin' for himwould i get it  his lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal water
the gaze he bent upon bo somehow pleased helen
the last year or two since bo had grown prettier all the time she had been a magnet for admiring glances
this one of the cowboy's inspired respect and liking as well as amusement
it certainly was not lost upon bo
my uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his ranch replied helen smiling
shore i'll go
i reckon i'd jest naturally drift that waynow  he seemed so laconic so easy so nice that he could not have been taken seriously yet helen's quick perceptions registered a daring a something that was both sudden and inevitable in him
his last word was as clear as the soft look he fixed upon bo
helen had a mischievous trait which subdue it as she would occasionally cropped out and bo who once in her wilful life had been rendered speechless offered such a temptation
maybe my little sister will put in a good word for youto uncle al  said helen
just then the train jerked and started slowly
the cowboy took two long strides beside the car his heated boyish face almost on a level with the window his eyes now shy and a little wistful yet bold too fixed upon bo
goodbysweetheart he called
he haltedwas lost to view
well ejaculated helen contritely half sorry half amused
what a sudden young gentleman  bo had blushed beautifully
nell wasn't he glorious she burst out with eyes shining
i'd hardly call him that but he wasnice replied helen much relieved that bo had apparently not taken offense at her
it appeared plain that bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the window and to wave her hand
but she only peeped out manifestly to her disappointment
do you think hehe'll come to uncle al's asked bo
child he was only in fun  nell i'll bet you he comes
oh it'd be great
i'm going to love cowboys
they don't look like that harve riggs who ran after you so  helen sighed partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor and partly because bo's future already called mysteriously to the child
helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense and wilful spirit
one of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green sloping mountain rising to a bold blunt bluff of bare rock and calling it starvation peak he told a story of how indians had once driven spaniards up there and starved them
bo was intensely interested and thereafter she watched more keenly than ever and always had a question for a passing trainman
the adobe houses of the mexicans pleased her and then the train got out into indian country where pueblos appeared near the track and indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild mustangsthen she was enraptured
but these indians are peaceful she exclaimed once regretfully
gracious child
you don't want to see hostile indians do you  queried helen
i do you bet was the frank rejoinder
well i'll bet that i'll be sorry i didn't leave you with mother  nellyou never will   they reached albuquerque about noon and this important station where they had to change trains had been the first dreaded anticipation of the journey
it certainly was a busy placefull of jabbering mexicans stalking redfaced wickedlooking cowboys lolling indians
in the confusion helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness with bo to watch and all that baggage to carry and the other train to find but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped them off the train into the othera service for which helen was very grateful
albuquerque's a hard place confided the trainman
better stay in the carand don't hang out the windows good luck to you  only a few passengers were in the car and they were mexicans at the forward end
this branch train consisted of one passengercoach with a baggagecar attached to a string of freightcars
helen told herself somewhat grimly that soon she would know surely whether or not her suspicions of harve riggs had warrant
if he was going on to magdalena on that day he must go in this coach
presently bo who was not obeying admonitions drew her head out of the window
her eyes were wide in amaze her mouth open
nell
i saw that man riggs she whispered
he's going to get on this train  bo i saw him yesterday replied helen soberly
he's followed youthethe  now bo don't get excited remonstrated helen
we've left home now
we've got to take things as they come
never mind if riggs has followed me
i'll settle him  oh
then you won't speakhave anything to do with him  i won't if i can help it  other passengers boarded the train dusty uncouth ragged men and some hardfeatured poorly clad women marked by toil and several more mexicans
with bustle and loud talk they found their several seats
then helen saw harve riggs enter burdened with much luggage
he was a man of about medium height of dark flashy appearance cultivating long black mustache and hair
his apparel was striking as it consisted of black frockcoat black trousers stuffed in high fancytopped boots an embroidered vest and flowing tie and a black sombrero
his belt and gun were prominent
it was significant that he excited comment among the other passengers
when he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself and turning abruptly approached the seat occupied by the girls
when he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite took off his sombrero and deliberately looked at helen
his eyes were light glinting with hard restless quiver and his mouth was coarse and arrogant
helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings and now the difference struck cold upon her heart
hello nell he said
surprised to see me  no she replied coldly
i'll gamble you are  harve riggs i told you the day before i left home that nothing you could do or say mattered to me  reckon that ain't so nell
any woman i keep track of has reason to think
an' you know it  then you followed meout here demanded helen and her voice despite her control quivered with anger
i sure did he replied and there was as much thought of himself in the act as there was of her
why
why
it's uselesshopeless  i swore i'd have you or nobody else would he replied and here in the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for a woman's love
but i reckon i'd have struck west anyhow sooner or later  you're not going toall the wayto pine faltered helen momentarily weakening
nell i'll camp on your trail from now on he declared
then bo sat boltupright with pale face and flashing eyes
harve riggs you leave nell alone she burst out in ringing brave young voice
i'll tell you whati'll betif you follow her and nag her any more my uncle al or some cowboy will run you out of the country  hello pepper replied riggs coolly
i see your manners haven't improved an' you're still wild about cowboys  people don't have good manners withwith  bo hush admonished helen
it was difficult to reprove bo just then for that young lady had not the slightest fear of riggs
indeed she looked as if she could slap his face
and helen realized that however her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a wild country and whatever her determination to be brave the actual beginning of selfreliance had left her spirit weak
she would rise out of that
but just now this flashingeyed little sister seemed a protector
bo would readily adapt herself to the west helen thought because she was so young primitive elemental
whereupon bo turned her back to riggs and looked out of the window
the man laughed
then he stood up and leaned over helen
nell i'm goin' wherever you go he said steadily
you can take that friendly or not just as it pleases you
but if you've got any sense you'll not give these people out here a hunch against me
i might hurt somebody an' wouldn't it be betterto act friends
for i'm goin' to look after you whether you like it or not  helen had considered this man an annoyance and later a menace and now she must declare open enmity with him
however disgusting the idea that he considered himself a factor in her new life it was the truth
he existed he had control over his movements
she could not change that
she hated the need of thinking so much about him and suddenly with a hot bursting anger she hated the man
you'll not look after me
i'll take care of myself she said and she turned her back upon him
she heard him mutter under his breath and slowly move away down the car
then bo slipped a hand in hers
never mind nell she whispered
you know what old sheriff haines said about harve riggs
'a fourflush wouldbe gunfighter
if he ever strikes a real western town he'll get run out of it'
i just wish my redfaced cowboy had got on this train  helen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to bo's wild importunities to take her west
the spirit which had made bo incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out in this free country
yet helen with all her warmth and gratefulness had to laugh at her sister
your redfaced cowboy
why bo you were scared stiff
and now you claim him  i certainly could love that fellow replied bo dreamily
child you've been saying that about fellows for a long time
and you've never looked twice at any of them yet  he was different nell i'll bet he comes to pine  i hope he does
i wish he was on this train
i liked his looks bo  well nell dear he looked at me first and lastso don't get your hopes up oh the train's starting
goodby albukerwhat's that awful name
nell let's eat dinner
i'm starved  then helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future and what with listening to bo's chatter and partaking again of the endless good things to eat in the huge basket and watching the noble mountains she drew once more into happy mood
the valley of the rio grande opened to view wide near at hand in a great graygreen gap between the bare black mountains narrow in the distance where the yellow river wound away glistening under a hot sun
bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little mexican children that darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by and she exclaimed her pleasure in the indians and the mustangs and particularly in a group of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses
helen saw all bo pointed out but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung longest and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something from her
she had never before experienced any feeling like that she had never seen a tenth so far
and the sight awoke something strange in her
the sun was burning hot as she could tell when she put a hand outside the window and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the train
she gathered at once what tremendous factors in the southwest were the sun and the dust and the wind
and her realization made her love them
it was there the open the wild the beautiful the lonely land and she felt the poignant call of blood in herto seek to strive to find to live
one look down that yellow valley endless between its dark iron ramparts had given her understanding of her uncle
she must be like him in spirit as it was claimed she resembled him otherwise
at length bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life and with her bright head on the faded cloak she went to sleep
but helen kept steady farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain and during the long hours as she watched through clouds of dust and veils of heat some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to change and then to fix
it was her physical acceptanceher eyes and her senses taking the west as she had already taken it in spirit
a woman should love her home wherever fate placed her helen believed and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living
how could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous vastness of bare earth and open sky where the need to achieve made thinking and pondering superficial
it was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the rio grande and then of its paralleled mountain ranges
but the miles brought compensation in other valleys other bold black upheavals of rock and then again bare boundless yellow plains and sparsely cedared ridges and white dry washes ghastly in the sunlight and dazzling beds of alkali and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers bloomed
she noted too that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had begun to shade to redand this she knew meant an approach to arizona
arizona the wild the lonely the red desert the green plateauarizona with its thundering rivers its unknown spaces its pasturelands and timberlands its wild horses cowboys outlaws wolves and lions and savages
as to a boy that name stirred and thrilled and sang to her of nameless sweet intangible things mysterious and all of adventure
but she being a girl of twenty who had accepted responsibilities must conceal the depths of her heart and that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being born a boy
time passed while helen watched and learned and dreamed
the train stopped at long intervals at wayside stations where there seemed nothing but adobe sheds and lazy mexicans and dust and heat
bo awoke and began to chatter and to dig into the basket
she learned from the conductor that magdalena was only two stations on
and she was full of conjectures as to who would meet them what would happen
so helen was drawn back to sober realities in which there was considerable zest
assuredly she did not know what was going to happen
twice riggs passed up and down the aisle his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile deliberately forced upon her sight
but again helen fought a growing dread with contemptuous scorn
this fellow was not half a man
it was not conceivable what he could do except annoy her until she arrived at pine
her uncle was to meet her or send for her at snowdrop which place helen knew was distant a good long ride by stage from magdalena
this stageride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey in helen's considerations
oh nell cried bo with delight
we're nearly there
next station the conductor said  i wonder if the stage travels at night said helen thoughtfully
sure it does replied the irrepressible bo
the train though it clattered along as usual seemed to helen to fly
there the sun was setting over bleak new mexican bluffs magdalena was at hand and night and adventure
helen's heart beat fast
she watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed their presence and irrigation ditches and cottonwoodtrees told her that the railroad part of the journey was nearly ended
then at bo's little scream she looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low flat redadobe houses
the train began to slow down
helen saw children run white children and mexican together then more houses and high upon a hill an immense adobe church crude and glaring yet somehow beautiful
helen told bo to put on her bonnet and performing a like office for herself she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers
there were bustle and talk in the car
the train stopped
helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of mexicans and indians all motionless and stolid as if trains or nothing else mattered
next helen saw a white man and that was a relief
he stood out in front of the others
tall and broad somehow striking he drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in grayfringed buckskin and carrying a rifle
chapter v  here there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their luggage
helen bade bo take her share thus burdened they made an awkward and laborious shift to get off the train
upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized helen's heavy bag with which she was straining and a loud voice called out  girls we're heresure out in the wild an' woolly west  the speaker was riggs and he had possessed himself of part of her baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious crowd than to be really kind
in the excitement of arriving helen had forgotten him
the manner of sudden reminderthe insincerity of itmade her temper flash
she almost fell encumbered as she was in her hurry to descend the steps
she saw the tall hunter in gray step forward close to her as she reached for the bag riggs held
mr
riggs i'll carry my bag she said
let me lug this
you help bo with hers he replied familiarly
but i want it she rejoined quietly with sharp determination
no little force was needed to pull the bag away from riggs
see here helen you ain't goin' any farther with that joke are you  he queried deprecatingly and he still spoke quite loud
it's no joke to me replied helen
i told you i didn't want your attention  sure
but that was temper
i'm your friendfrom your home town
an' i ain't goin' to let a quarrel keep me from lookin' after you till you're safe at your uncle's  helen turned her back upon him
the tall hunter had just helped bo off the car
then helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing gray eyes
are you helen rayner he asked
yes  my name's dale
i've come to meet you  ah
my uncle sent you added helen in quick relief
no i can't say al sent me began the man but i reckon  he was interrupted by riggs who grasping helen by the arm pulled her back a step
say mister did auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here  he demanded arrogantly
dale's glance turned from helen to riggs
she could not read this quiet gray gaze but it thrilled her
no
i come on my own hook he answered
you'll understand thenthey're in my charge added riggs
this time the steady lightgray eyes met helen's and if there was not a smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled
helen i reckon you said you didn't want this fellow's attention  i certainly said that replied helen quickly
just then bo slipped close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze
probably bo's thought was like hershere was a real western man
that was her first impression and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased nerves
riggs swaggered closer to dale
say buckskin i hail from texas  you're wastin' our time an' we've need to hurry interrupted dale
his tone seemed friendly
an' if you ever lived long in texas you wouldn't pester a lady an' you sure wouldn't talk like you do  what shouted riggs hotly
he dropped his right hand significantly to his hip
don't throw your gun
it might go off said dale
whatever riggs's intention had beenand it was probably just what dale evidently had read ithe now flushed an angry red and jerked at his gun
dale's hand flashed too swiftly for helen's eye to follow it
but she heard the thud as it struck
the gun went flying to the platform and scattered a group of indians and mexicans
you'll hurt yourself some day said dale
helen had never heard a slow cool voice like this hunter's
without excitement or emotion or hurry it yet seemed full and significant of things the words did not mean
bo uttered a strange little exultant cry
riggs's arm had dropped limp
no doubt it was numb
he stared and his predominating expression was surprise
as the shuffling crowd began to snicker and whisper riggs gave dale a malignant glance shifted it to helen and then lurched away in the direction of his gun
dale did not pay any more attention to him
gathering up helen's baggage he said come on and shouldered a lane through the gaping crowd
the girls followed close at his heels
nell
what 'd i tell you whispered bo
oh you're all atremble  helen was aware of her unsteadiness anger and fear and relief in quick succession had left her rather weak
once through the motley crowd of loungers she saw an old gray stagecoach and four lean horses
a grizzled sunburned man sat on the driver's seat whip and reins in hand
beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees
another man young tall lean dark stood holding the coach door open
he touched his sombrero to the girls
his eyes were sharp as he addressed dale
milt wasn't you held up  no
but some longhaired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls
wanted to throw his gun on me
i was sure scared replied dale as he deposited the luggage
bo laughed
her eyes resting upon dale were warm and bright
the young man at the coach door took a second look at her and then a smile changed the dark hardness of his face
dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage and then placing the lighter luggage in with them he threw the heavier pieces on top
joe climb up he said
wal milt drawled the driver let's ooze along  dale hesitated with his hand on the door
he glanced at the crowd now edging close again and then at helen
i reckon i ought to tell you he said and indecision appeared to concern him
what exclaimed helen
bad news
but talkin' takes time
an' we mustn't lose any  there's need of hurry queried helen sitting up sharply
i reckon  is this the stage to snowdrop
no
that leaves in the mornin'
we rustled this old trap to get a start tonight  the sooner the better
but ii don't understand said helen bewildered
it'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage returned dale
safe
oh what do you mean exclaimed helen
apprehensively she gazed at him and then back at bo
explainin' will take time
an' facts may change your mind
but if you can't trust me  trust you interposed helen blankly
you mean to take us to snowdrop  i reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit snowdrop he replied shortly
then to pineto my uncleal auchincloss
yes i'm goin' to try hard  helen caught her breath
she divined that some peril menaced her
she looked steadily with all a woman's keenness into this man's face
the moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the west had in store for her
her future and that of bo's were now to be dependent upon her judgments
it was a hard moment and though she shivered inwardly she welcomed the initial and inevitable step
this man dale by his dress of buckskin must be either scout or hunter
his size his action the tone of his voice had been reassuring
but helen must decide from what she saw in his face whether or not to trust him
and that face was clear bronze unlined unshadowed like a tranquil mask cleancut strongjawed with eyes of wonderful transparent gray
yes i'll trust you she said
get in and let us hurry
then you can explain  all ready bill
send 'em along called dale
he had to stoop to enter the stage and once in he appeared to fill that side upon which he sat
then the driver cracked his whip the stage lurched and began to roll the motley crowd was left behind
helen awakened to the reality as she saw bo staring with big eyes at the hunter that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began with the rattling roll of that old stagecoach
dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward holding his rifle between his knees
the light shone better upon his features now that he was bareheaded
helen had never seen a face like that which at first glance appeared darkly bronzed and hard and then became clear cold aloof still intense
she wished she might see a smile upon it
and now that the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it
there was singular force in it but she did not recognize what kind of force
one instant she thought it was stern and the next that it was sweet and again that it was neither
i'm glad you've got your sister he said presently
how did you know she's my sister  i reckon she looks like you  no one else ever thought so replied helen trying to smile
bo had no difficulty in smiling as she said wish i was half as pretty as nell  nell
isn't your name helen queried dale
yes
but mysome few call me nell  i like nell better than helen
an' what's yours went on dale looking at bo
mine's bo
just plain bo
isn't it silly
but i wasn't asked when they gave it to me she replied
bo
it's nice an' short
never heard it before
but i haven't met many people for years  oh
we've left the town cried bo
look nell
how bare
it's just like desert  it is desert
we've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a tree  helen glanced out
a flat dullgreen expanse waved away from the road on and on to a bright dark horizonline where the sun was setting rayless in a clear sky
open desolate and lonely the scene gave her a cold thrill
did your uncle al ever write anythin' about a man named beasley asked dale
indeed he did replied helen with a start of surprise
beasley
that name is familiar to usand detestable
my uncle complained of this man for years
then he grew bitteraccused beasley
but the last year or so not a word  well now began the hunter earnestly let's get the bad news over
i'm sorry you must be worried
but you must learn to take the west as it is
there's good an' bad maybe more bad
that's because the country's young
so to come right out with itthis beasley hired a gang of outlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to snowdroptomorrowan' to make off with you  make off with me ejaculated helen bewildered
kidnap you
which in that gang would be worse than killing you  declared dale grimly and he closed a huge fist on his knee
helen was utterly astounded
how horrible she gasped out
make off with me
what in heaven's name for  bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance
for reasons you ought to guess replied dale and he leaned forward again
neither his voice nor face changed in the least but yet there was a something about him that fascinated helen
i'm a hunter
i live in the woods
a few nights ago i happened to be caught out in a storm an' i took to an old log cabin
soon as i got there i heard horses
i hid up in the loft
some men rode up an' come in
it was dark
they couldn't see me
an' they talked
it turned out they were snake anson an' his gang of sheepthieves
they expected to meet beasley there
pretty soon he came
he told anson how old al your uncle was on his last legshow he had sent for you to have his property when he died
beasley swore he had claims on al
an' he made a deal with anson to get you out of the way
he named the day you were to reach magdalena
with al dead an' you not there beasley could get the property
an' then he wouldn't care if you did come to claim it
it 'd be too late well they rode away that night
an' next day i rustled down to pine
they're all my friends at pine except old al
but they think i'm queer
i didn't want to confide in many people
beasley is strong in pine an' for that matter i suspect snake anson has other friends there besides beasley
so i went to see your uncle
he never had any use for me because he thought i was lazy like an indian
old al hates lazy men
then we fell outor he fell outbecause he believed a tame lion of mine had killed some of his sheep
an' now i reckon that tom might have done it
i tried to lead up to this deal of beasley's about you but old al wouldn't listen
he's crossvery cross
an' when i tried to tell him why he went right out of his head
sent me off the ranch
now i reckon you begin to see what a pickle i was in
finally i went to four friends i could trust
they're mormon boysbrothers
that's joe out on top with the driver
i told them all about beasley's deal an' asked them to help me
so we planned to beat anson an' his gang to magdalena
it happens that beasley is as strong in magdalena as he is in pine
an' we had to go careful
but the boys had a couple of friends heremormons too who agreed to help us
they had this old stage an' here you are dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at helen and then at bo
you're perfectly splendid cried bo ringingly
she was white her fingers were clenched her eyes blazed
dale appeared startled out of his gravity and surprised then pleased
a smile made his face like a boy's
helen felt her body all rigid yet slightly trembling
her hands were cold
the horror of this revelation held her speechless
but in her heart she echoed bo's exclamation of admiration and gratitude
so far then resumed dale with a heavy breath of relief
no wonder you're upset
i've a blunt way of talkin' now we've thirty miles to ride on this snowdrop road before we can turn off
today sometime the rest of the boysroy john an' halwere to leave show down which's a town farther on from snowdrop
they have my horses an' packs besides their own
somewhere on the road we'll meet themtonight maybeor tomorrow
i hope not tonight because that 'd mean anson's gang was ridin' in to magdalena  helen wrung her hands helplessly
oh have i no courage she whispered
nell i'm as scared as you are said bo consolingly embracing her sister
i reckon that's natural said dale as if excusing them
but scared or not you both brace up
it's a bad job
but i've done my best
an' you'll be safer with me an' the beeman boys than you'd be in magdalena or anywhere else except your uncle's  mrmr
dale faltered helen with her tears falling don't think me a cowardoror ungrateful
i'm neither
it's only i'm soso shocked
after all we hoped and expectedthisthisis such aa terrible surprise  never mind nell dear
let's take what comes murmured bo
that's the talk said dale
you see i've come right out with the worst
maybe we'll get through easy
when we meet the boys we'll take to the horses an' the trails
can you ride  bo has been used to horses all her life and i ride fairly well  responded helen
the idea of riding quickened her spirit
good
we may have some hard ridin' before i get you up to pine
hello
what's that  above the creaking rattling rolling roar of the stage helen heard a rapid beat of hoofs
a horse flashed by galloping hard
dale opened the door and peered out
the stage rolled to a halt
he stepped down and gazed ahead
joe who was that he queried
nary me
an' bill didn't know him either replied joe
i seen him 'way back
he was ridin' some
an' he slowed up goin' past us
now he's runnin' again  dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances
milt he'll never get by roy on this road said joe
maybe he'll get by before roy strikes in on the road  it ain't likely  helen could not restrain her fears
mr
dale you think he was a messengergoing ahead to post thatthat anson gang  he might be replied dale simply
then the young man called joe leaned out from the seat above and called miss helen don't you worry
thet fellar is more liable to stop lead than anythin' else  his words meant to be kind and reassuring were almost as sinister to helen as the menace to her own life
long had she known how cheap life was held in the west but she had only known it abstractly and she had never let the fact remain before her consciousness
this cheerful young man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf
the thought it roused was tragicfor bloodshed was insupportable to herand then the thrills which followed were so new strange bold and tingling that they were revolting
helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths of instincts at which she was amazed and ashamed
joe hand down that basket of grubthe small one with the canteen  said dale reaching out a long arm
presently he placed a clothcovered basket inside the stage
girls eat all you want an' then some  we have a basket half full yet replied helen
you'll need it all before we get to pine now i'll ride up on top with the boys an' eat my supper
it'll be dark presently an' we'll stop often to listen
but don't be scared  with that he took his rifle and closing the door clambered up to the driver's seat
then the stage lurched again and began to roll along
not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way bo reached for the basket of food
helen simply stared at her
bo you can't eat she exclaimed
i should smile i can replied that practical young lady
and you're going to if i have to stuff things in your mouth
where's your wits nell
he said we must eat
that means our strength is going to have some pretty severe trials gee
it's all greatjust like a story
the unexpectedwhy he looks like a prince turned hunterlong dark stage journeyheld upfightescapewild ride on horseswoods and camps and wild placespursuedhidden in the forestmore hard ridesthen safe at the ranch
and of course he falls madly in love with meno you for i'll be true to my las vegas lover  hush silly
bo tell me aren't you scared  scared
i'm scared stiff
but if western girls stand such things we can
no western girl is going to beat me  that brought helen to a realization of the brave place she had given herself in dreams and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly proud of this little sister
bo thank heaven i brought you with me exclaimed helen fervently
i'll eat if it chokes me  whereupon she found herself actually hungry and while she ate she glanced out of the stage first from one side and then from the other
these windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in
the sun had long since sunk
out to the west where a bold black horizonline swept away endlessly the sky was clear gold shading to yellow and blue above
stars were out pale and wan but growing brighter
the earth appeared bare and heaving like a calm sea
the wind bore a fragrance new to helen acridly sweet and clean and it was so cold it made her fingers numb
i heard some animal yelp said bo suddenly and she listened with head poised
but helen heard nothing save the steady clipclop of hoofs the clink of chains the creak and rattle of the old stage and occasionally the low voices of the men above
when the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst night had settled down black
they pulled the cloaks up over them and close together leaned back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers
helen did not have much to say but bo was talkative
this beats me she said once after an interval
where are we nell
those men up there are mormons
maybe they are abducting us  mr
dale isn't a mormon replied helen
how do you know  i could tell by the way he spoke of his friends  well i wish it wasn't so dark
i'm not afraid of men in daylight nell did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow
what'd they call him
miltmilt dale
he said he lived in the woods
if i hadn't fallen in love with that cowboy who called mewell i'd be a goner now  after an interval of silence bo whispered startlingly wonder if harve riggs is following us now  of course he is replied helen hopelessly
he'd better look out
why nell he never sawhe neverwhat did uncle al used to call itsavsavviedthat's it
riggs never savvied that hunter
but i did you bet  savvied
what do you mean bo  i mean that longhaired galoot never saw his real danger
but i felt it
something went light inside me
dale never took him seriously at all  riggs will turn up at uncle al's sure as i'm born said helen
let him turn replied bo contemptuously
nell don't you ever bother your head again about him
i'll bet they're all men out here
and i wouldn't be in harve riggs's boots for a lot  after that bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness and from that she drifted back to the loved ones at home now seemingly at the other side of the world and then she broke down and cried after which she fell asleep on helen's shoulder
but helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to
she had always since she could remember longed for a moving active life and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies
and now it struck her grimly that if these first few hours of her advent in the west were forecasts of the future she was destined to have her longings more than fulfilled
presently the stage rolled slower and slower until it came to a halt
then the horses heaved the harnesses clinked the men whispered
otherwise there was an intense quiet
she looked out expecting to find it pitchdark
it was black yet a transparent blackness
to her surprise she could see a long way
a shootingstar electrified her
the men were listening
she listened too but beyond the slight sounds about the stage she heard nothing
presently the driver clucked to his horses and travel was resumed
for a while the stage rolled on rapidly evidently downhill swaying from side to side and rattling as if about to fall to pieces
then it slowed on a level and again it halted for a few moments and once more in motion it began a laborsome climb
helen imagined miles had been covered
the desert appeared to heave into billows growing rougher and dark round bushes dimly stood out
the road grew uneven and rocky and when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted bo out of her sleep and in fact almost out of helen's arms
where am i asked bo dazedly
bo you're having your heart's desire but i can't tell you where you are replied helen
bo awakened thoroughly which fact was now no wonder considering the jostling of the old stage
hold on to me nell
is it a runaway  we've come about a thousand miles like this i think replied helen
i've not a whole bone in my body  bo peered out of the window
oh how dark and lonesome
but it'd be nice if it wasn't so cold
i'm freezing  i thought you loved cold air taunted helen
say nell you begin to talk like yourself responded bo
it was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak all at once but they succeeded except in the roughest places when from time to time they were bounced around
bo sustained a sharp rap on the head
oooooo she moaned
nell rayner i'll never forgive you for fetching me on this awful trip  just think of your handsome las vegas cowboy replied helen
either this remark subdued bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile her to the hardships of the ride
meanwhile as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep the driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of western men who knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance
by and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so long with the men whispering on top that helen and bo were roused to apprehension
suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead
thet's roy said joe beeman in a low voice
i reckon
an' meetin' us so quick looks bad replied dale
drive on bill  mebbe it seems quick to you muttered the driver but if we hain't come thirty mile an' if thet ridge thar hain't your turnin'off place why i don't know nothin'  the stage rolled on a little farther while helen and bo sat clasping each other tight wondering with bated breath what was to be the next thing to happen
then once more they were at a standstill
helen heard the thud of boots striking the ground and the snorts of horses
nell i see horses whispered bo excitedly
there to the side of the road and here comes a man oh if he shouldn't be the one they're expecting  helen peered out to see a tall dark form moving silently and beyond it a vague outline of horses and then pale gleams of what must have been packloads
dale loomed up and met the stranger in the road
howdy milt
you got the girl sure or you wouldn't be here said a low voice
roy i've got two girlssisters replied dale
the man roy whistled softly under his breath
then another lean rangy form strode out of the darkness and was met by dale
now boyshow about anson's gang queried dale
at snowdrop drinkin' an' quarrelin'
reckon they'll leave there about daybreak replied roy
how long have you been here  mebbe a couple of hours  any horse go by  no  roy a strange rider passed us before dark
he was hittin' the road
an' he's got by here before you came  i don't like thet news replied roy tersely
let's rustle
with girls on hossback you'll need all the start you can get
hey john  snake anson shore can foller hoss tracks replied the third man
milt say the word went on roy as he looked up at the stars
daylight not far away
here's the forks of the road an' your hosses an' our outfit
you can be in the pines by sunup  in the silence that ensued helen heard the throb of her heart and the panting little breaths of her sister
they both peered out hands clenched together watching and listening in strained attention
it's possible that rider last night wasn't a messenger to anson said dale
in that case anson won't make anythin' of our wheel tracks or horse tracks
he'll go right on to meet the regular stage
bill can you go back an' meet the stage comin' before anson does  wal i reckon soan' take it easy at thet replied bill
all right continued dale instantly
john you an' joe an' hal ride back to meet the regular stage
an' when you meet it get on an' be on it when anson holds it up  thet's shore agreeable to me drawled john
i'd like to be on it too said roy grimly
no
i'll need you till i'm safe in the woods
bill hand down the bags
an' you roy help me pack them
did you get all the supplies i wanted  shore did
if the young ladies ain't powerful particular you can feed them well for a couple of months  dale wheeled and striding to the stage he opened the door
girls you're not asleep
come he called
bo stepped down first
i was asleep till thisthis vehicle fell off the road back a ways  she replied
roy beeman's low laugh was significant
he took off his sombrero and stood silent
the old driver smothered a loud guffaw
veehicle
wal i'll be doggoned
joe did you hear thet
all the spunky gurls ain't born out west  as helen followed with cloak and bag roy assisted her and she encountered keen eyes upon her face
he seemed both gentle and respectful and she felt his solicitude
his heavy gun swinging low struck her as she stepped down
dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags
these he set down on the ground
turn around bill an' go along with you
john an' hal will follow presently ordered dale
wal gurls said bill looking down upon them i was shore powerful glad to meet youall
an' i'm ashamed of my countryofferin' two sich purty gurls insults an' lowdown tricks
but shore you'll go through safe now
you couldn't be in better company fer ridin' or huntin' or marryin' or gittin' religion  shut up you old grizzly broke in dale sharply
haw
haw
goodby gurls an' good luck ended bill as he began to whip the reins
bo said goodby quite distinctly but helen could only murmur hers
the old driver seemed a friend
then the horses wheeled and stamped the stage careened and creaked presently to roll out of sight in the gloom
you're shiverin' said dale suddenly looking down upon helen
she felt his big hard hand clasp hers
cold as ice  i am ccold replied helen
i guess we're not warmly dressed  nell we roasted all day and now we're freezing declared bo
i didn't know it was winter at night out here  miss haven't you some warm gloves an' a coat asked roy anxiously
it 'ain't begun to get cold yet  nell we've heavy gloves ridingsuits and bootsall fine and newin this black bag said bo enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet
yes so we have
but a lot of good they'll do us tonight returned helen
miss you'd do well to change right here said roy earnestly
it'll save time in the long run an' a lot of sufferin' before sunup  helen stared at the young man absolutely amazed with his simplicity
she was advised to change her travelingdress for a ridingsuitout somewhere in a cold windy desertin the middle of the nightamong strange young men
bo which bag is it asked dale as if she were his sister
and when she indicated the one he picked it up
come off the road  bo followed him and helen found herself mechanically at their heels
dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes
hurry an' change here he said
we'll make a pack of your outfit an' leave room for this bag  then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared
bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes
helen could just see her pale pretty face and big gleaming eyes by the light of the stars
it struck her then that bo was going to make eminently more of a success of western life than she was
nell those fellows are nnice said bo reflectively
aren't you ccold
say he said hurry  it was beyond helen's comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out there in that open windy desert but after she had gotten launched on the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage
the cold wind pierced right through her
almost she could have laughed at the way bo made things fly
ggggee chattered bo
i nnever wwas so cccold in all my life
nell rayner mmay the ggood lord forgive yyou  helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk
she was a strong healthy girl swift and efficient with her hands yet this the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced almost overcame her
bo outdistanced her by moments helped her with buttons and laced one whole boot for her
then with hands that stung helen packed the travelingsuits in the bag
there
but what an awful mess exclaimed helen
oh bo our pretty travelingdresses  we'll press them ttomorrowon a llog replied bo and she giggled
they started for the road
bo strange to note did not carry her share of the burden and she seemed unsteady on her feet
the men were waiting beside a group of horses one of which carried a pack
nothin' slow about you said dale relieving helen of the grip
roy put them up while i sling on this bag  roy led out two of the horses
get up he said indicating bo
the stirrups are short on this saddle  bo was an adept at mounting but she made such awkward and slow work of it in this instance that helen could not believe her eyes
haw 're the stirrups asked roy
stand in them
guess they're about right
careful now
thet hoss is skittish
hold him in  bo was not living up to the reputation with which helen had credited her
now miss you get up said roy to helen
and in another instant she found herself astride a black spirited horse
numb with cold as she was she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins
roy was at the stirrups with swift hands
you're taller 'n i guessed he said
stay up but lift your foot
shore now i'm glad you have them thick soft boots
mebbe we'll ride all over the white mountains  bo do you hear that called helen
but bo did not answer
she was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle
helen became anxious
just then dale strode back to them
all cinched up roy  jest ready replied roy
then dale stood beside helen
how tall he was
his wide shoulders seemed on a level with the pommel of her saddle
he put an affectionate hand on the horse
his name's ranger an' he's the fastest an' finest horse in this country  i reckon he shore isalong with my bay corroborated roy
roy if you rode ranger he'd beat your pet said dale
we can start now
roy you drive the packhorses  he took another look at helen's saddle and then moved to do likewise with bo's
are youall right he asked quickly
bo reeled in her seat
i'm nnear froze she replied in a faint voice
her face shone white in the starlight
helen recognized that bo was more than cold
oh bo she called in distress
nell don't you worry now  let me carry you suggested dale
no
i'll ssstick on this horse or ddie fiercely retorted bo
the two men looked up at her white face and then at each other
then roy walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and dale swung astride the one horse left
keep close to me he said
bo fell in line and helen brought up the rear
helen imagined she was near the end of a dream
presently she would awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at home and hear the cherry branches brushing her window and the old clarionvoiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn
chapter vi  the horses trotted
and the exercise soon warmed helen until she was fairly comfortable except in her fingers
in mind however she grew more miserable as she more fully realized her situation
the night now became so dark that although the head of her horse was alongside the flank of bo's she could scarcely see bo
from time to time helen's anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right
helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year and for several years she had not ridden with any regularity
despite her thrills upon mounting she had entertained misgivings
but she was agreeably surprised for the horse ranger had an easy gait and she found she had not forgotten how to ride
bo having been used to riding on a farm near home might be expected to acquit herself admirably
it occurred to helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick comfortable riding outfits
dark as the night was helen could dimly make out the road underneath
it was rocky and apparently little used
when dale turned off the road into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain the traveling was harder rougher and yet no slower
the horses kept to the gait of the leaders
helen discovering it unnecessary ceased attempting to guide ranger
there were dim shapes in the gloom ahead and always they gave helen uneasiness until closer approach proved them to be rocks or low scrubby trees
these increased in both size and number as the horses progressed
often helen looked back into the gloom behind
this act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread
dale expected to be pursued
and helen experienced along with the dread flashes of unfamiliar resentment
not only was there an attempt afoot to rob her of her heritage but even her personal liberty
then she shuddered at the significance of dale's words regarding her possible abduction by this hired gang
it seemed monstrous impossible
yet manifestly it was true enough to dale and his allies
the west then in reality was raw hard inevitable
suddenly her horse stopped
he had come up alongside bo's horse
dale had halted ahead and apparently was listening
roy and the packtrain were out of sight in the gloom
what is it whispered helen
reckon i heard a wolf replied dale
was that cry a wolf's asked bo
i heard
it was wild  we're gettin' up close to the foothills said dale
feel how much colder the air is  i'm warm now replied bo
i guess being near froze was what ailed me nell how 're you  i'm warm too but helen answered
if you had your choice of being here or back home snug in bedwhich would you take asked bo
bo exclaimed helen aghast
well i'd choose to be right here on this horse rejoined bo
dale heard her for he turned an instant then slapped his horse and started on
helen now rode beside bo and for a long time they climbed steadily in silence
helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed and she welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east
then the stars paled
gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars
the great white morning star wonderful as helen had never seen it lost its brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue
daylight came gradually so that the gray desert became distinguishable by degrees
rolling bare hills half obscured by the gray lifting mantle of night rose in the foreground and behind was gray space slowly taking form and substance
in the east there was a kindling of pale rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing visibly rugged
reckon we'd better catch up with roy said dale and he spurred his horse
ranger and bo's mount needed no other urging and they swung into a canter
far ahead the packanimals showed with roy driving them
the cold wind was so keen in helen's face that tears blurred her eyes and froze her cheeks
and riding ranger at that pace was like riding in a rockingchair
that ride invigorating and exciting seemed all too short
oh nell i don't carewhat becomes ofme exclaimed bo breathlessly
her face was white and red fresh as a rose her eyes glanced darkly blue her hair blew out in bright unruly strands
helen knew she felt some of the physical stimulation that had so roused bo and seemed so irresistible but somber thought was not deflected thereby
it was clear daylight when roy led off round a knoll from which patches of scrubby treescedars dale called themstraggled up on the side of the foothills
they grow on the north slopes where the snow stays longest said dale
they descended into a valley that looked shallow but proved to be deep and wide and then began to climb another foothill
upon surmounting it helen saw the rising sun and so glorious a view confronted her that she was unable to answer bo's wild exclamations
bare yellow cedardotted slopes apparently level so gradual was the ascent stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose black over range after range at last to fail near the bare summit of a magnificent mountain sunriseflushed against the blue sky
oh beautiful cried bo
but they ought to be called black mountains  old baldy there is white half the year replied dale
look back an' see what you say suggested roy
the girls turned to gaze silently
helen imagined she looked down upon the whole wide world
how vastly different was the desert
verily it yawned away from her red and gold near at hand growing softly flushed with purple far away a barren void borderless and immense where darkgreen patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to emphasize distance and space
see thet little green spot said roy pointing
thet's snowdrop
an' the other one'way to the rightthet's show down  where is pine queried helen eagerly
farther still up over the foothills at the edge of the woods  then we're riding away from it  yes
if we'd gone straight for pine thet gang could overtake us
pine is four days' ride
an' by takin' to the mountains milt can hide his tracks
an' when he's thrown anson off the scent then he'll circle down to pine  mr
dale do you think you'll get us there safelyand soon asked helen wistfully
i won't promise soon but i promise safe
an' i don't like bein' called mister he replied
are we ever going to eat inquired bo demurely
at this query roy beeman turned with a laugh to look at bo
helen saw his face fully in the light and it was thin and hard darkly bronzed with eyes like those of a hawk and with square chin and lean jaws showing scant light beard
we shore are he replied
soon as we reach the timber
thet won't be long  reckon we can rustle some an' then take a good rest said dale and he urged his horse into a jogtrot
during a steady trot for a long hour helen's roving eyes were everywhere taking note of the things from near to farthe scant sage that soon gave place to as scanty a grass and the dark blots that proved to be dwarf cedars and the ravines opening out as if by magic from what had appeared level ground to wind away widening between gray stone walls and farther on patches of lonely pinetrees two and three together and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens and up beyond the fringed border of forest growing nearer all the while the black sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of the range
no birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber which fact seemed strange to helen
the air lost something of its cold cutting edge as the sun rose higher and it gained sweeter tang of forestland
the first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly new to helen yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and with it an emotion as strange
it was as if she had smelled that keen pungent tang long ago and her physical sense caught it before her memory
the yellow plain had only appeared to be level
roy led down into a shallow ravine where a tiny stream meandered and he followed this around to the left coming at length to a point where cedars and dwarf pines formed a little grove
here as the others rode up he sat crosslegged in his saddle and waited
we'll hang up awhile he said
reckon you're tired  i'm hungry but not tired yet replied bo
helen dismounted to find that walking was something she had apparently lost the power to do
bo laughed at her but she too was awkward when once more upon the ground
then roy got down
helen was surprised to find him lame
he caught her quick glance
a hoss threw me once an' rolled on me
only broke my collarbone five ribs one arm an' my bowlegs in two places  notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple as he stood there tall and lithe in his homespun ragged garments he looked singularly powerful and capable
reckon walkin' around would be good for you girls advised dale
if you ain't stiff yet you'll be soon
an' walkin' will help
don't go far
i'll call when breakfast's ready   a little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and found campfire and meal awaiting them
roy was sitting crosslegged like an indian in front of a tarpaulin upon which was spread a homely but substantial fare
helen's quick eye detected a cleanliness and thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of men of the wilds
moreover the fare was good
she ate heartily and as for bo's appetite she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as amused at it
the young men were all eyes assiduous in their service to the girls but speaking seldom
it was not lost upon helen how dale's gray gaze went often down across the open country
she divined apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it
ideclare burst out bo when she could not eat any more this isn't believable
i'm dreaming nell the black horse you rode is the prettiest i ever saw  ranger with the other animals was grazing along the little brook
packs and saddles had been removed
the men ate leisurely
there was little evidence of hurried flight
yet helen could not cast off uneasiness
roy might have been deep and careless with a motive to spare the girls' anxiety but dale seemed incapable of anything he did not absolutely mean
rest or walk he advised the girls
we've got forty miles to ride before dark  helen preferred to rest but bo walked about petting the horses and prying into the packs
she was curious and eager
dale and roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and packed them away in a heavy canvas bag
you really expect anson 'll strike my trail this mornin' dale was asking
i shore do replied roy
an' how do you figure that so soon  how'd you figure itif you was snake anson queried roy in reply
depends on that rider from magdalena said dale soberly
although it's likely i'd seen them wheel tracks an' hoss tracks made where we turned off
but supposin' he does  milt listen
i told you snake met us boys face to face day before yesterday in show down
an' he was plumb curious  but he missed seein' or hearin' about me replied dale
mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't
anyway what's the difference whether he finds out this mornin' or this evenin'  then you ain't expectin' a fight if anson holds up the stage  wal he'd have to shoot first which ain't likely
john an' hal since thet shootin'scrape a year ago have been sort of gunshy
joe might get riled
but i reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay
an' it'd be sense not to count on thet  then you hang up here an' keep watch for anson's gangsay long enough so's to be sure they'd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin'
makin' sure one way or another you ride 'crosscountry to big spring where i'll camp tonight  roy nodded approval of that suggestion
then without more words both men picked up ropes and went after the horses
helen was watching dale so that when bo cried out in great excitement helen turned to see a savage yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing the air
roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp
nell look at that for a wild pony exclaimed bo
helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated mustang
roy dragged him to a cedar near by
come now buckskin said roy soothingly and he slowly approached the quivering animal
he went closer hand over hand on the lasso
buckskin showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth
but he stood while roy loosened the loop and slipping it down over his head fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose
thet's a hackamore he said indicating the knot
he's never had a bridle an' never will have one i reckon  you don't ride him queried helen
sometimes i do replied roy with a smile
would you girls like to try him  excuse me answered helen
gee ejaculated bo
he looks like a devil
but i'd tackle himif you think i could  the wild leaven of the west had found quick root in bo rayner
wal i'm sorry but i reckon i'll not let youfor a spell replied roy dryly
he pitches somethin' powerful bad  pitches
you mean bucks  i reckon  in the next halfhour helen saw more and learned more about how horses of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of
excepting ranger and roy's bay and the white pony bo rode the rest of the horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and packed
it was a job for fearless strong men and one that called for patience as well as arms of iron
so that for helen rayner the thing succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect
to an observing woman that halfhour told much
when all was in readiness for a start dale mounted and said significantly roy i'll look for you about sundown
i hope no sooner  wal it'd be bad if i had to rustle along soon with bad news
let's hope for the best
we've been shore lucky so far
now you take to the pinemats in the woods an' hide your trail  dale turned away
then the girls bade roy goodby and followed
soon roy and his buckskincolored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of trees
the unhampered horses led the way the packanimals trotted after them the riders were close behind
all traveled at a jogtrot
and this gait made the packs bob up and down and from side to side
the sun felt warm at helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness that almost appeared damp for a dry sweet fragrance
dale drove up the shallow valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of timber some few miles ahead
it did not take long to reach the edge of the forest
helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no farther
probably the growth had to do with snow but as the ground was level she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just there
they rode into the forest
to helen it seemed a strange critical entrance into another world which she was destined to know and to love
the pines were big brownbarked seamed and knotted with no typical conformation except a majesty and beauty
they grew far apart
few small pines and little underbrush flourished beneath them
the floor of this forest appeared remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and wide brown areas of pineneedles
these manifestly were what roy had meant by pinemats
here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or rotting
helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all and when they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log
likewise she became aware of a springy nature of the ground
and then she saw that the pinemats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the horses and after they had passed sprang back to place again leaving no track
helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind
indeed it would take a sharp eye to follow dale through that forest
this knowledge was infinitely comforting to helen and for the first time since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind and heart
it left her free for some of the appreciation she might have had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances
bo however seemed too young too wild too intense to mind what the circumstances were
she responded to reality
helen began to suspect that the girl would welcome any adventure and helen knew surely now that bo was a true auchincloss
for three long days helen had felt a constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar for the last hours it had been submerged under dread
but it must be she concluded blood like her sister's pounding at her veins to be set free to race and to burn
bo loved action
she had an eye for beauty but she was not contemplative
she was now helping dale drive the horses and hold them in rather close formation
she rode well and as yet showed no symptoms of fatigue or pain
helen began to be aware of both but not enough yet to limit her interest
a wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her
of all living creatures in nature helen liked birds best and she knew many and could imitate the songs of a few
but here under the stately pines there were no birds
squirrels however began to be seen here and there and in the course of an hour's travel became abundant
the only one with which she was familiar was the chipmunk
all the others from the slim bright blacks to the striped russets and the whitetailed grays were totally new to her
they appeared tame and curious
the reds barked and scolded at the passing cavalcade the blacks glided to some safe branch there to watch the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their domain
once dale halting his horse pointed with long arm and helen following the direction descried several gray deer standing in a glade motionless with long ears up
they made a wild and beautiful picture
suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides
the forest on the whole held to the level open character but there were swales and streambeds breaking up its regular conformity
toward noon however it gradually changed a fact that helen believed she might have observed sooner had she been more keen
the general lay of the land began to ascend and the trees to grow denser
she made another discovery
ever since she had entered the forest she had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting her nostrils
she imagined with regret that she had taken cold
but presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch
the smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength
also her throat and lungs seemed to burn
when she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied recognition
thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they grew worse
one especially was a pain beyond all her experience
it lay in the muscles of her side above her hip and it grew to be a treacherous thing for it was not persistent
it came and went
after it did come with a terrible flash it could be borne by shifting or easing the body
but it gave no warning
when she expected it she was mistaken when she dared to breathe again then with piercing swiftness it returned like a blade in her side
this then was one of the ridingpains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride
it was almost too much to be borne
the beauty of the forest the living creatures to be seen scurrying away the time distanceeverything faded before that stablike pain
to her infinite relief she found that it was the trot that caused this torture
when ranger walked she did not have to suffer it
therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared or until dale and bo were almost out of sight then she loped him ahead until he had caught up
so the hours passed the sun got around low sending golden shafts under the trees and the forest gradually changed to a brighter but a thicker color
this slowly darkened
sunset was not far away
she heard the horses splashing in water and soon she rode up to see the tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss
she crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a more open place in the forest where the pines were huge towering and far apart
a low gray bluff of stone rose to the right perhaps onethird as high as the trees
from somewhere came the rushing sound of running water
big spring announced dale
we camp here
you girls have done well  another glance proved to helen that all those little streams poured from under this gray bluff
i'm dying for a drink cried bo with her customary hyperbole
i reckon you'll never forget your first drink here remarked dale
bo essayed to dismount and finally fell off and when she did get to the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function and she fell flat
dale helped her up
what's wrong with me anyhow she demanded in great amaze
just stiff i reckon replied dale as he led her a few awkward steps
bo have you any hurts queried helen who still sat her horse loath to try dismounting yet wanting to beyond all words
bo gave her an eloquent glance
nell did you have one in your side like a wicked long darningneedle punching deep when you weren't ready  that one i'll never get over exclaimed helen softly
then profiting by bo's experience she dismounted cautiously and managed to keep upright
her legs felt like wooden things
presently the girls went toward the spring
drink slow called out dale
big spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray weathered bluff from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water
its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold stone
helen and bo lay flat on a mossy bank seeing their faces as they bent over and they sipped a mouthful by dale's advice and because they were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a precious opportunity
the water was so cold that it sent a shock over helen made her teeth ache and a singular revivifying current steal all through her wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh irresistible in its appeal to thirst
helen raised her head to look at this water
it was colorless as she had found it tasteless
nelldrink panted bo
think of ourold springin the orchardfull of pollywogs  and then helen drank thirstily with closed eyes while a memory of home stirred from bo's gift of poignant speech
chapter vii  the first camp duty dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the horses and opening it he took out tarpaulin and blankets which he arranged on the ground under a pinetree
you girls rest he said briefly
can't we help asked helen though she could scarcely stand
you'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in  broke in ejaculated bo with a little laugh
i'm all broke up now  bo it looks as if mr dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in the woods  it does replied bo as slowly she sat down upon the blankets stretched out with a long sigh and laid her head on a saddle
nell didn't he say not to call him mister  dale was throwing the packs off the other horses
helen lay down beside bo and then for once in her life she experienced the sweetness of rest
well sister what do you intend to call him queried helen curiously
milt of course replied bo
helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches
i suppose then when your las vegas cowboy comes along you will call him what he called you  bo blushed which was a rather unusual thing for her
i will if i like she retorted
nell ever since i could remember you've raved about the west
now you're out west right in it good and deep
so wake up  that was bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination of helen's superficialities
it sank deep
helen had no retort
her ambition as far as the west was concerned had most assuredly not been for such a wild unheardof jaunt as this
but possibly the westa living from day to daywas one succession of adventures trials tests troubles and achievements
to make a place for others to live comfortably some day
that might be bo's meaning embodied in her forceful hint
but helen was too tired to think it out then
she found it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch dale
he hobbled the horses and turned them loose
then with ax in hand he approached a short dead tree standing among a few whitebarked aspens
dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax
with his coat off displaying his wide shoulders straight back and long powerful arms he looked a young giant
he was lithe and supple brawny but not bulky
the ax rang on the hard wood reverberating through the forest
a few strokes sufficed to bring down the stub
then he split it up
helen was curious to see how he kindled a fire
first he ripped splinters out of the heart of the log and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground
then from a saddlebag which hung on a nearby branch he took flint and steel and a piece of what helen supposed was rag or buckskin upon which powder had been rubbed
at any rate the first strike of the steel brought sparks a blaze and burning splinters
instantly the flame leaped a foot high
he put on larger pieces of wood crosswise and the fire roared
that done he stood erect and facing the north he listened
helen remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before since the arrival at big spring
it was roy for whom he was listening and watching
the sun had set and across the open space the tips of the pines were losing their brightness
the camp utensils which the hunter emptied out of a sack gave forth a jangle of iron and tin
next he unrolled a large pack the contents of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes
these evidently contained food supplies
the bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over it pack and all
dale filled it at the spring
upon returning to the campfire he poured water into a washbasin and getting down to his knees proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly
the act seemed a habit for helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods and listened
then he dried his hands over the fire and turning to the spreadout pack he began preparations for the meal
suddenly helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied
at magdalena on the stageride and last night she had trusted this stranger a hunter of the white mountains who appeared ready to befriend her
and she had felt an exceeding gratitude
still she had looked at him impersonally
but it began to dawn upon her that chance had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man
that impression baffled her
it did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind to help a young woman in peril or that he appeared deft and quick at campfire chores
most western men were brave her uncle had told her and many were roughly kind and all of them could cook
this hunter was physically a wonderful specimen of manhood with something leonine about his stature
but that did not give rise to her impression
helen had been a schoolteacher and used to boys and she sensed a boyish simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter
she believed however that it was a mental and spiritual force in dale which had drawn her to think of it
nell i've spoken to you three times protested bo petulantly
what 're you mooning over  i'm pretty tiredand far away bo replied helen
what did you say  i said i had an enormous appetite  really
that's not remarkable for you
i'm too tired to eat
and afraid to shut my eyes
they'd never come open
when did we sleep last bo  second night before we left home declared bo
four nights
oh we've slept some  i'll bet i make mine up in this woods
do you suppose we'll sleep right hereunder this treewith no covering  it looks so replied helen dubiously
how perfectly lovely exclaimed bo in delight
we'll see the stars through the pines  seems to be clouding over
wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm  why i don't know answered bo thoughtfully
it must storm out west  again helen felt a quality of inevitableness in bo
it was something that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in st joseph
all of a sudden helen received a flash of wondering thoughta thrilling consciousness that she and bo had begun to develop in a new and wild environment
how strange and fearful perhaps to watch that growth
bo being younger more impressionable with elemental rather than intellectual instincts would grow stronger more swiftly
helen wondered if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive
but how could anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way
it was the savage who did not think
helen saw dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest
reckon roy ain't comin' he soliloquized
an' that's good then he turned to the girls
supper's ready  the girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity
and they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods
dale attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face
tomorrow night we'll have meat he said
what kind asked bo
wild turkey or deer
maybe both if you like
but it's well to take wild meat slow
an' turkeythat 'll melt in your mouth  uummm murmured bo greedily
i've heard of wild turkey  when they had finished dale ate his meal listening to the talk of the girls and occasionally replying briefly to some query of bo's
it was twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans and almost dark by the time his duties appeared ended
then he replenished the campfire and sat down on a log to gaze into the fire
the girls leaned comfortably propped against the saddles
nell i'll keel over in a minute said bo
and i oughtn'tright on such a big supper  i don't see how i can sleep and i know i can't stay awake rejoined helen
dale lifted his head alertly
listen  the girls grew tense and still
helen could not hear a sound unless it was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom
the forest seemed sleeping
she knew from bo's eyes wide and shining in the campfire light that she too had failed to catch whatever it was dale meant
bunch of coyotes comin' he explained
suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy highstrung strange barks
they sounded wild yet they held something of a friendly or inquisitive note
presently gray forms could be descried just at the edge of the circle of light
soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded the camp and then barks and yelps broke out all around
it was a restless and sneaking pack of animals thought helen she was glad after the chorus ended and with a few desultory spiteful yelps the coyotes went away
silence again settled down
if it had not been for the anxiety always present in helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and unfamiliarly beautiful
ah
listen to that fellow spoke up dale
his voice was thrilling
again the girls strained their ears
that was not necessary for presently clear and cold out of the silence pealed a mournful howl long drawn strange and full and wild
oh
what's that whispered bo
that's a big gray wolfa timberwolf or lofer as he's sometimes called replied dale
he's high on some rocky ridge back there
he scents us an' he doesn't like it
there he goes again
listen
ah he's hungry  while helen listened to this exceedingly wild cryso wild that it made her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come over hershe kept her glance upon dale
you love him she murmured involuntarily quite without understanding the motive of her query
assuredly dale had never had that question asked of him before and it seemed to helen as he pondered that he had never even asked it of himself
i reckon so he replied presently
but wolves kill deer and little fawns and everything helpless in the forest expostulated bo
the hunter nodded his head
why then can you love him repeated helen
come to think of it i reckon it's because of lots of reasons  returned dale
he kills clean
he eats no carrion
he's no coward
he fights
he dies game an' he likes to be alone  kills clean
what do you mean by that  a cougar now he mangles a deer
an' a silvertip when killin' a cow or colt he makes a mess of it
but a wolf kills clean with sharp snaps  what are a cougar and a silvertip  cougar means mountainlion or panther an' a silvertip is a grizzly bear  oh they're all cruel exclaimed helen shrinking
i reckon
often i've shot wolves for relayin' a deer  what's that  sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer an' while one of them rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner who'll take up the chase
that way they run the deer down
cruel it is but nature an' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer or a fox that kills turkeychicks breakin' out of the egg or ravens that pick the eyes out of newborn lambs an' wait till they die
an' for that matter men are crueler than beasts of prey for men add to nature an' have more than instincts  helen was silenced as well as shocked
she had not only learned a new and striking viewpoint in natural history but a clear intimation to the reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in this man
a hunter was one who killed animals for their fur for their meat or horns or for some lust for bloodthat was helen's definition of a hunter and she believed it was held by the majority of people living in settled states
but the majority might be wrong
a hunter might be vastly different and vastly more than a tracker and slayer of game
the mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men
perhaps dale knew its secrets its life its terror its beauty its sadness and its joy and if so how full how wonderful must be his mind
he spoke of men as no better than wolves
could a lonely life in the wilderness teach a man that
bitterness envy jealousy spite greed and hatethese had no place in this hunter's heart
it was not helen's shrewdness but a woman's intuition which divined that
dale rose to his feet and turning his ear to the north listened once more
are you expecting roy still inquired helen
no it ain't likely he'll turn up tonight replied dale and then he strode over to put a hand on the pinetree that soared above where the girls lay
his action and the way he looked up at the treetop and then at adjacent trees held more of that significance which so interested helen
i reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand through tonight muttered dale
this pine was the monarch of that widespread group
listen again said dale
bo was asleep
and helen listening at once caught low distant roar
wind
it's goin' to storm explained dale
you'll hear somethin' worth while
but don't be scared
reckon we'll be safe
pines blow down often
but this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was
better slip under the blankets so i can pull the tarp up  helen slid down just as she was fully dressed except for boots which she and bo had removed and she laid her head close to bo's
dale pulled the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads
when it rains you'll wake an' then just pull the tarp up over you he said
will it rain helen asked
but she was thinking that this moment was the strangest that had ever happened to her
by the light of the campfire she saw dale's face just as usual still darkly serene expressing no thought
he was kind but he was not thinking of these sisters as girls alone with him in a pitchblack forest helpless and defenseless
he did not seem to be thinking at all
but helen had never before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience
i'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night he said
she heard him stride off into the darkness
presently there came a dragging bumping sound then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire
a cloud of sparks shot up and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp ground
smoke again curled upward along the great seamed treetrunk and flames sputtered and crackled
helen listened again for the roar of wind
it seemed to come on a breath of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew bo's curls and it was stronger
but it died out presently only to come again and still stronger
helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching storm
her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open and she knew if she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep
and she wanted to hear the stormwind in the pines
a few drops of cold rain fell upon her face thrilling her with the proof that no roof stood between her and the elements
then a breeze bore the smell of burnt wood into her face and somehow her quick mind flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little brothers
the memory faded
the roar that had seemed distant was now back in the forest coming swiftly increasing in volume
like a stream in flood it bore down
helen grew amazed startled
how rushing oncoming and heavy this stormwind
she likened its approach to the tread of an army
then the roar filled the forest yet it was back there behind her
not a pineneedle quivered in the light of the campfire
but the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge
the roar augmented till it was no longer a roar but an onsweeping crash like an ocean torrent engulfing the earth
bo awoke to cling to helen with fright
the deafening stormblast was upon them
helen felt the saddlepillow move under her head
the giant pine had trembled to its very roots
that mighty fury of wind was all aloft in the treetops
and for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power
then the deafening crash passed to roar and that swept on and on lessening in volume deepening in low detonation at last to die in the distance
no sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and ceased and rose again
helen lay there whispering to bo and heard again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease
that was the way of this stormwind of the mountain forest
a soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned helen to remember dale's directions and pulling up the heavy covering she arranged it hoodlike over the saddle
then with bo close and warm beside her she closed her eyes and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain faded
last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the tarpaulin
when she opened her eyes she remembered everything as if only a moment had elapsed
but it was daylight though gray and cloudy
the pines were dripping mist
a fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air
horses were standing near by biting and kicking at one another
bo was sound asleep
dale appeared busy around the campfire
as helen watched the hunter she saw him pause in his task turn his ear to listen and then look expectantly
and at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest
helen recognized roy's voice
then she heard a splashing of water and hoofbeats coming closer
with that the buckskin mustang trotted into camp carrying roy
bad mornin' for ducks but good for us he called
howdy roy greeted dale and his gladness was unmistakable
i was lookin' for you  roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort and his swift hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled
buckskin was wet with sweat and foam mixed with rain
he heaved
and steam rose from him
must have rode hard observed dale
i shore did replied roy
then he espied helen who had sat up with hands to her hair and eyes staring at him
mornin' miss
it's good news  thank heaven murmured helen and then she shook bo
that young lady awoke but was loath to give up slumber
bo
bo
wake up
mr roy is back  whereupon bo sat up disheveled and sleepyeyed
ohh but i ache she moaned
but her eyes took in the camp scene to the effect that she added is breakfast ready  almost
an' flapjacks this mornin' replied dale
bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she laced her boots
helen got their travelingbag and with this they repaired to a flat stone beside the spring not however out of earshot of the men
how long are you goin' to hang around camp before tellin' me inquired dale
jest as i figgered milt replied roy
thet rider who passed you was a messenger to anson
he an' his gang got on our trail quick
about ten o'clock i seen them comin'
then i lit out for the woods
i stayed off in the woods close enough to see where they come in
an' shore they lost your trail
then they spread through the woods workin' off to the south thinkin' of course thet you would circle round to pine on the south side of old baldy
there ain't a hosstracker in snake anson's gang thet's shore
wal i follered them for an hour till they'd rustled some miles off our trail
then i went back to where you struck into the woods
an' i waited there all afternoon till dark expectin' mebbe they'd backtrail
but they didn't
i rode on a ways an' camped in the woods till jest before daylight  so far so good declared dale
shore
there's rough country south of baldy an' along the two or three trails anson an' his outfit will camp you bet  it ain't to be thought of muttered dale at some idea that had struck him
what ain't  goin' round the north side of baldy  it shore ain't rejoined roy bluntly
then i've got to hide tracks certainrustle to my camp an' stay there till you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to pine  milt you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets  i ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether
if anson had any eyes for the woods he'd not have lost me so soon
no
but you see he's figgerin' to cross your trail  if i could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks certain i'd feel safe from pursuit anyway said the hunter reflectively
shore an' easy responded roy quickly
i jest met up with some greaser sheepherders drivin' a big flock
they've come up from the south an' are goin' to fatten up at turkey senacas
then they'll drive back south an' go on to phenix
wal it's muddy weather
now you break camp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail as if you was travelin' south
but instead you ride round ahead of thet flock of sheep
they'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks of woods out here
an' passin' over your tracks they'll hide 'em  but supposin' anson circles an' hits this camp
he'll track me easy out to that sheep trail
what then  jest what you want
goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy
it's goin' to rain hard
your tracks would get washed out even if you did go south
an' anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the scent
leave it to me milt
you're a hunter
but i'm a hosstracker  all right
we'll rustle  then he called the girls to hurry
chapter viii  once astride the horse again helen had to congratulate herself upon not being so crippled as she had imagined
indeed bo made all the audible complaints
both girls had long waterproof coats brandnew and of which they were considerably proud
new clothes had not been a common event in their lives
reckon i'll have to slit these dale had said whipping out a huge knife
what for had been bo's feeble protest
they wasn't made for ridin'
an' you'll get wet enough even if i do cut them
an' if i don't you'll get soaked  go ahead had been helen's reluctant permission
so their long new coats were slit halfway up the back
the exigency of the case was manifest to helen when she saw how they came down over the cantles of the saddles and to their boottops
the morning was gray and cold
a fine misty rain fell and the trees dripped steadily
helen was surprised to see the open country again and that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while
the country was wide and flat on the right and to the left it rolled and heaved along a black scalloped timberline
above this bordering of the forest low drifting clouds obscured the mountains
the wind was at helen's back and seemed to be growing stronger
dale and roy were ahead traveling at a good trot with the packanimals bunched before them
helen and bo had enough to do to keep up
the first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery but it gave helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up all day
she began to welcome the places where the horses walked but she disliked the levels
as for the descents she hated those
ranger would not go down slowly and the shakeup she received was unpleasant
moreover the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and washes
he sailed over them like a bird
helen could not acquire the knack of sitting the saddle properly and so not only was her person bruised on these occasions but her feelings were hurt
helen had never before been conscious of vanity
still she had never rejoiced in looking at a disadvantage and her exhibitions here must have been frightful
bo always would forge to the front and she seldom looked back for which helen was grateful
before long they struck into a broad muddy belt full of innumerable small hoof tracks
this then was the sheep trail roy had advised following
they rode on it for three or four miles and at length coming to a graygreen valley they saw a huge flock of sheep
soon the air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep and a low soft roar of pattering hoofs
the flock held a compact formation covering several acres and grazed along rapidly
there were three herders on horses and several packburros
dale engaged one of the mexicans in conversation and passed something to him then pointed northward and down along the trail
the mexican grinned from ear to ear and helen caught the quick si senor
gracias senor it was a pretty sight that flock of sheep as it rolled along like a rounded woolly stream of grays and browns and here and there a black
they were keeping to a trail over the flats
dale headed into this trail and if anything trotted a little faster
presently the clouds lifted and broke showing blue sky and one streak of sunshine
but the augury was without warrant
the wind increased
a huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a swiftly moving wall
soon it enveloped the fugitives
with head bowed helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold gray rain that blew almost on a level
finally the heavy downpour passed leaving a fine mist
the clouds scurried low and dark hiding the mountains altogether and making the gray wet plain a dreary sight
helen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water
and they were cold
her gloves too had not been intended for rain and they were wet through
the cold bit at her fingers so that she had to beat her hands together
ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was to trot faster which event was worse for helen than freezing
she saw another black scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its trailing sheets of rain and this one appeared streaked with white
snow
the wind was now piercingly cold
helen's body kept warm but her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly
she gazed ahead grimly
there was no help she had to go on
dale and roy were hunched down in their saddles probably wet through for they wore no rainproof coats
bo kept close behind them and plain it was that she felt the cold
this second storm was not so bad as the first because there was less rain
still the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow
it lasted for an hour during which the horses trotted on trotted on
again the gray torrent roared away the fine mist blew the clouds lifted and separated and closing again darkened for another onslaught
this one brought sleet
the driving pellets stung helen's neck and cheeks and for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was afraid she could not hold up under them
the bare places on the ground showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice
thus storm after storm rolled over helen's head
her feet grew numb and ceased to hurt
but her fingers because of her ceaseless efforts to keep up the circulation retained the stinging pain
and now the wind pierced right through her
she marveled at her endurance and there were many times that she believed she could not ride farther
yet she kept on
all the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as this
hard and cold wet and windy at an increasing elevationthat was the explanation
the air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood
still during all those interminable hours helen watched where she was traveling and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize it
the afternoon appeared far advanced when dale and roy led down into an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats
they rode along its margin splashing up to the knees of the horses
cranes and herons flew on with lumbering motion flocks of ducks winged swift flight from one side to the other
beyond this depression the land sloped rather abruptly outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of the highest ground and again a dark fringe of trees appeared
how many miles
wondered helen
they seemed as many and as long as the hours
but at last just as another hard rain came the pines were reached
they proved to be widely scattered and afforded little protection from the storm
helen sat her saddle a dead weight
whenever ranger quickened his gait or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling off
her mind harbored only sensations of misery and a persistent thoughtwhy did she ever leave home for the west
her solicitude for bo had been forgotten
nevertheless any marked change in the topography of the country was registered perhaps photographed on her memory by the torturing vividness of her experience
the forest grew more level and denser
shadows of twilight or gloom lay under the trees
presently dale and roy disappeared going downhill and likewise bo
then helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid water
ranger trotted faster
soon helen came to the edge of a great valley black and gray so full of obscurity that she could not see across or down into it
but she knew there was a rushing river at the bottom
the sound was deep continuous a heavy murmuring roar singularly musical
the trail was steep
helen had not lost all feeling as she had believed and hoped
her poor mistreated body still responded excruciatingly to concussions jars wrenches and all the other horrible movements making up a horsetrot
for long helen did not look up
when she did so there lay a green willowbordered treeless space at the bottom of the valley through which a brownwhite stream rushed with steady earfilling roar
dale and roy drove the packanimals across the stream and followed going deep to the flanks of their horses
bo rode into the foaming water as if she had been used to it all her days
a slip a fall would have meant that bo must drown in that mountain torrent
ranger trotted straight to the edge and there obedient to helen's clutch on the bridle he halted
the stream was fifty feet wide shallow on the near side deep on the opposite with fast current and big waves
helen was simply too frightened to follow
let him come yelled dale
stick on now
ranger  the big black plunged in making the water fly
that stream was nothing for him though it seemed impassable to helen
she had not the strength left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them
ranger in two more plunges surmounted the bank and then trotting across the green to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines he gave a great heave and halted
roy reached up to help her off
thirty miles miss helen he said and the way he spoke was a compliment
he had to lift her off and help her to the tree where bo leaned
dale had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddleblankets on the ground under the pine
nellyou sworeyou loved me was bo's mournful greeting
the girl was pale drawn bluelipped and she could not stand up
bo i never didor i'd never have brought you to thiswretch that i am cried helen
oh what a horrible ride  rain was falling the trees were dripping the sky was lowering
all the ground was soaking wet with pools and puddles everywhere
helen could imagine nothing but a heartless dreary cold prospect
just then home was vivid and poignant in her thoughts
indeed so utterly miserable was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down of a cessation of movement of a release from that infernal perpetualtrotting horse seemed only a mockery
it could not be true that the time had come for rest
evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheepherders for there were remains of a fire
dale lifted the burnt end of a log and brought it down hard upon the ground splitting off pieces
several times he did this
it was amazing to see his strength his facility as he split off handfuls of splinters
he collected a bundle of them and laying them down he bent over them
roy wielded the ax on another log and each stroke split off a long strip
then a tiny column of smoke drifted up over dale's shoulder as he leaned bareheaded sheltering the splinters with his hat
a blaze leaped up
roy came with an armful of strips all white and dry out of the inside of a log
crosswise these were laid over the blaze and it began to roar
then piece by piece the men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods branches and stumps and logs erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke roared upward
it had not taken two minutes
already helen felt the warmth on her icy face
she held up her bare numb hands
both dale and roy were wet through to the skin yet they did not tarry beside the fire
they relieved the horses
a lasso went up between two pines and a tarpaulin over it vshaped and pegged down at the four ends
the packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and bedding were placed under this shelter
helen thought this might have taken five minutes more
in this short space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot
rain was falling steadily all around but over and near that roaring blaze ten feet high no water fell
it evaporated
the ground began to steam and to dry
helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out the cold
but presently the pain ceased
nell i never knew before how good a fire could feel declared bo
and therein lay more food for helen's reflection
in ten minutes helen was dry and hot
darkness came down upon the dreary sodden forest but that great campfire made it a different world from the one helen had anticipated
it blazed and roared cracked like a pistol hissed and sputtered shot sparks everywhere and sent aloft a dense yellow whirling column of smoke
it began to have a heart of gold
dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the coffeepot and oven soon began to steam
roy i promised the girls turkey tonight said the hunter
mebbe tomorrow if the wind shifts
this 's turkey country  roy a potato will do me exclaimed bo
never again will i ask for cake and pie
i never appreciated good things to eat
and i've been a little pig always
i nevernever knew what it was to be hungryuntil now  dale glanced up quickly
lass it's worth learnin' he said
helen's thought was too deep for words
in such brief space had she been transformed from misery to comfort
the rain kept on falling though it appeared to grow softer as night settled down black
the wind died away and the forest was still except for the steady roar of the stream
a folded tarpaulin was laid between the pine and the fire well in the light and warmth and upon it the men set steaming pots and plates and cups the fragrance from which was strong and inviting
fetch the saddleblanket an' set with your backs to the fire said roy
later when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and sheltered from the rain helen remained awake after bo had fallen asleep
the big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day
she could see the smoke the trunk of the big pine towering aloft and a blank space of sky
the stream hummed a song seemingly musical at times and then discordant and dull now low now roaring and always rushing gurgling babbling flowing chafing in its hurry
presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses and beside the fire they conversed in low tones
wal thet trail we made today will be hid i reckon said roy with satisfaction
what wasn't sheeped over would be washed out
we've had luck
an' now i ain't worryin' returned dale
worryin'
then it's the first i ever knowed you to do  man i never had a job like this protested the hunter
wal thet's so  now roy when old al auchincloss finds out about this deal as he's bound to when you or the boys get back to pine he's goin' to roar  do you reckon folks will side with him against beasley  some of them
but al like as not will tell folks to go where it's hot
he'll bunch his men an' strike for the mountains to find his nieces  wal all you've got to do is to keep the girls hid till i can guide him up to your camp
or failin' thet till you can slip the girls down to pine  no one but you an' your brothers ever seen my senaca
but it could be found easy enough  anson might blunder on it
but thet ain't likely  why ain't it  because i'll stick to thet sheepthief's tracks like a wolf after a bleedin' deer
an' if he ever gets near your camp i'll ride in ahead of him  good declared dale
i was calculatin' you'd go down to pine sooner or later  not unless anson goes
i told john thet in case there was no fight on the stage to make a beeline back to pine
he was to tell al an' offer his services along with joe an' hal  one way or another then there's bound to be blood spilled over this  shore
an' high time
i jest hope i get a look down my old 'fortyfour' at thet beasley  in that case i hope you hold straighter than times i've seen you  milt dale i'm a good shot declared roy stoutly
you're no good on movin' targets  wal mebbe so
but i'm not lookin' for a movin' target when i meet up with beasley
i'm a hossman not a hunter
you're used to shootin' flies off deer's horns jest for practice  roy can we make my camp by tomorrow night queried dale more seriously
we will if each of us has to carry one of the girls
but they'll do it or die
dale did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid bo  me
where'd i ever see any girls ejaculated dale
i remember some when i was a boy but i was only fourteen then
never had much use for girls  i'd like to have a wife like that bo declared roy fervidly
there ensued a moment's silence
roy you're a mormon an' you already got a wife was dale's reply
now milt have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of a mormon with two wives returned roy and then he laughed heartily
i never could stomach what i did hear pertainin' to more than one wife for a man  wal my friend you go an' get yourself one
an' see then if you wouldn't like to have two  i reckon one 'd be more than enough for milt dale  milt old man let me tell you thet i always envied you your freedom  said roy earnestly
but it ain't life  you mean life is love of a woman  no
thet's only part
i mean a sona boy thet's like youthet you feel will go on with your life after you're gone  i've thought of thatthought it all out watchin' the birds an' animals mate in the woods
if i have no son i'll never live hereafter  wal replied roy hesitatingly i don't go in so deep as thet
i mean a son goes on with your blood an' your work  exactly an' roy i envy you what you ve got because it's out of all bounds for milt dale  those words sad and deep ended the conversation
again the rumbling rushing stream dominated the forest
an owl hooted dismally
a horse trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of teeth on grass
a voice pierced helen's deep dreams and awaking she found bo shaking and calling her
are you dead came the gay voice
almost
oh my back's broken replied helen
the desire to move seemed clamped in a vise and even if that came she believed the effort would be impossible
roy called us said bo
he said hurry
i thought i'd die just sitting up and i'd give you a million dollars to lace my boots
wait sister till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots  with heroic and violent spirit helen sat up to find that in the act her aches and pains appeared beyond number
reaching for her boots she found them cold and stiff
helen unlaced one and opening it wide essayed to get her sore foot down into it
but her foot appeared swollen and the boot appeared shrunken
she could not get it half on though she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms
she groaned
bo laughed wickedly
her hair was tousled her eyes dancing her cheeks red
be game she said
stand up like a real western girl and pull your boot on  whether bo's scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to helen but the fact was that she got into her boots
walking and moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired feeling
the water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than any ice helen had ever felt
it almost paralyzed her hands
bo mumbled and blew like a porpoise
they had to run to the fire before being able to comb their hair
the air was wonderfully keen
the dawn was clear bright with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise
all ready girls called roy
reckon you can help yourselves
milt ain't comin' in very fast with the hosses
i'll rustle off to help him
we've got a hard day before us
yesterday wasn't nowhere to what today 'll be  but the sun's going to shine implored bo
wal you bet rejoined roy as he strode off
helen and bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps half an hour then the horses came thudding down with dale and roy riding bareback
by the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up melting the frost and ice so that a dazzling bright mist full of rainbows shone under the trees
dale looked ranger over and tried the cinches of bo's horse
what's your choicea long ride behind the packs with meor a short cut over the hills with roy he asked
i choose the lesser of two rides replied helen smiling
reckon that 'll be easier but you'll know you've had a ride said dale significantly
what was that we had yesterday asked bo archly
only thirty miles but cold an' wet
today will be fine for ridin'  milt i'll take a blanket an' some grub in case you don't meet us tonight said roy
an' i reckon we'll split up here where i'll have to strike out on thet short cut  bo mounted without a helping hand but helen's limbs were so stiff that she could not get astride the high ranger without assistance
the hunter headed up the slope of the canyon which on that side was not steep
it was brown pine forest with here and there a clump of dark silverpointed evergreens that roy called spruce
by the time this slope was surmounted helen's aches were not so bad
the saddle appeared to fit her better and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar
she reflected however that she always had done pretty well uphill
here it was beautiful forestland uneven and wilder
they rode for a time along the rim with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below with its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear
dale reined in and peered down at the pinemat
fresh deer sign all along here he said pointing
wal i seen thet long ago rejoined roy
helen's scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in the pineneedles dark in color and sharply defined
we may never get a better chance said dale
those deer are workin' up our way
get your rifle out  travel was resumed then with roy a little in advance of the packtrain
presently he dismounted threw his bridle and cautiously peered ahead
then turning he waved his sombrero
the packanimals halted in a bunch
dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to roy's horse
this point helen saw was at the top of an intersecting canuon
dale dismounted without drawing his rifle from its saddlesheath and approached roy
buck an' two does he said lowvoiced
an' they've winded us but don't see us yet
girls ride up closer  following the directions indicated by dale's long arm helen looked down the slope
it was open with tall pines here and there and clumps of silver spruce and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight
presently bo exclaimed oh look
i see
i see then helen's roving glance passed something different from green and gold and brown
shifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag with noble spreading antlers standing like a statue his head up in alert and wild posture
his color was gray
beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more graceful build without horns
it's downhill whispered dale
an' you're goin' to overshoot  then helen saw that roy had his rifle leveled
oh don't she cried
dale's remark evidently nettled roy
he lowered the rifle
milt it's me lookin' over this gun
how can you stand there an' tell me i'm goin' to shoot high
i had a dead bead on him  roy you didn't allow for downhill
hurry
he sees us now  roy leveled the rifle and taking aim as before he fired
the buck stood perfectly motionless as if he had indeed been stone
the does however jumped with a start and gazed in fright in every direction
told you
i seen where your bullet hit thet pinehalf a foot over his shoulder
try again an' aim at his legs  roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger
a puff of dust right at the feet of the buck showed where roy's lead had struck this time
with a single bound wonderful to see the big deer was out of sight behind trees and brush
the does leaped after him
doggone the luck ejaculated roy red in the face as he worked the lever of his rifle
never could shoot downhill nohow  his rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from bo
not for worlds would i have had you kill that beautiful deer she exclaimed
we won't have venison steak off him that's certain remarked dale dryly
an' maybe none off any deer if roy does the shootin'  they resumed travel sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge of the intersecting canuon
at length they rode down to the bottom where a tiny brook babbled through willows and they followed this for a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream
a dim trail overgrown with grass showed at this point
here's where we part said dale
you'll beat me into my camp but i'll get there sometime after dark  hey milt i forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an' the rest of your menagerie
reckon they won't scare the girls
especially old tom  you won't see tom till i get home replied dale
ain't he corralled or tied up  no
he has the run of the place  wal goodby then an' rustle along  dale nodded to the girls and turning his horse he drove the packtrain before him up the open space between the stream and the wooded slope
roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a feat to helen
guess i'd better cinch up he said as he threw a stirrup up over the pommel of his saddle
you girls are goin' to see wild country  who's old tom queried bo curiously
why he's milt's pet cougar  cougar
that's a panthera mountainlion didn't he say  shore is
tom is a beauty
an' if he takes a likin' to you he'll love you play with you maul you half to death  bo was all eyes
dale has other pets too she questioned eagerly
i never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an' squirrels an' vermin of all kinds as tame as tame as cows
too darn tame milt says
but i can't figger thet
you girls will never want to leave thet senaca of his  what's a senaca asked helen as she shifted her foot to let him tighten the cinches on her saddle
thet's mexican for park i guess he replied
these mountains are full of parks an' say i don't ever want to see no prettier place till i get to heaven
there ranger old boy thet's tight  he slapped the horse affectionately and turning to his own he stepped and swung his long length up
it ain't deep crossin' here
come on he called and spurred his bay
the stream here was wide and it looked deep but turned out to be deceptive
wal girls here beginneth the second lesson he drawled cheerily
ride one behind the otherstick close to medo what i doan' holler when you want to rest or if somethin' goes bad  with that he spurred into the thicket
bo went next and helen followed
the willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch roy and the result was that a lowsweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard on the head
it hurt and startled her and roused her mettle
roy was keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well and he led up a slope to the open pine forest
here the ride for several miles was straight level and open
helen liked the forest today
it was brown and green with patches of gold where the sun struck
she saw her first birdbig blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse and little checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing
several times roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle and often when he pointed helen was not quick enough to see
helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of yesterday
so far she had been only barely conscious of sore places and aching bones
these she would bear with
she loved the wild and the beautiful both of which increased manifestly with every mile
the sun was warm the air fragrant and cool the sky blue as azure and so deep that she imagined that she could look far up into it
suddenly roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short
look he called sharply
bo screamed
not thet way
here
aw he's gone  nell
it was a bear
i saw it
oh
not like circus bears at all cried bo
helen had missed her opportunity
reckon he was a grizzly an' i'm jest as well pleased thet he loped off said roy
altering his course somewhat he led to an old rotten log that the bear had been digging in
after grubs
there see his track
he was a whopper shore enough  they rode on out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range gorge and ridge green and black as far as helen could see
the ranges were bold and long climbing to the central uplift where a number of fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of old baldy
far as vision could see to the right lay one rolling forest of pine beautiful and serene
somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert but it was not in sight
i see turkeys 'way down there said roy backing away
we'll go down and around an' mebbe i'll get a shot  descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush
this slope consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and many oaks
helen was delighted to see the familiar trees although these were different from missouri oaks
rugged and gnarled but not tall these trees spread wide branches the leaves of which were yellowing
roy led into a grassy glade and leaping off his horse rifle in hand he prepared to shoot at something
again bo cried out but this time it was in delight
then helen saw an immense flock of turkeys apparently like the turkeys she knew at home but these had bronze and checks of white and they looked wild
there must have been a hundred in the flock most of them hens
a few gobblers on the far side began the flight running swiftly off
helen plainly heard the thud of their feet
roy shot oncetwicethree times
then rose a great commotion and thumping and a loud roar of many wings
dust and leaves whirling in the air were left where the turkeys had been
wal i got two said roy and he strode forward to pick up his game
returning he tied two shiny plump gobblers back of his saddle and remounted his horse
we'll have turkey tonight if milt gets to camp in time  the ride was resumed
helen never would have tired riding through those oak groves brown and sear and yellow with leaves and acorns falling
bears have been workin' in here already said roy
i see tracks all over
they eat acorns in the fall
an' mebbe we'll run into one yet  the farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees so that dodging branches was no light task
ranger did not seem to care how close he passed a tree or under a limb so that he missed them himself but helen thereby got some additional bruises
particularly hard was it when passing a tree to get her knee out of the way in time
roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation and in places covered with a thick scum
but it had a current and an outlet proving it to be a huge spring
roy pointed down at a muddy place
bearwallow
he heard us comin'
look at thet little track
cub track
an' look at these scratches on this tree higher 'n my head
an old shebear stood up an' scratched them  roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree
woods's full of big bears he said grinning
an' i take it particular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub
shebears with cubs are dangerous  the next place to stir helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom of this canuon
beechtrees maples aspens overtopped by lofty pines made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown swirling current and leaves drifted down and stray flecks of golden sunlight lightened the gloom
here was hard riding to and fro across the brook between huge mossy boulders and between aspens so close together that helen could scarce squeeze her knees through
once more roy climbed out of that canuon over a ridge into another down long wooded slopes and through scruboak thickets on and on till the sun stood straight overhead
then he halted for a short rest unsaddled the horses to let them roll and gave the girls some cold lunch that he had packed
he strolled off with his gun and upon returning resaddled and gave the word to start
that was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls
the forest that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines so steep of slope as to make precarious travel
mostly he kept to the bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail
but it was necessary to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed and this crossing was work
the locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close knit
they tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders
ranger appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less
bo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place
on the other hand some of these steep slopes were comparatively free of underbrush
great firs and pines loomed up on all sides
the earth was soft and the hoofs sank deep
toward the bottom of a descent ranger would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches
this mode facilitated travel but it frightened helen
the climb out then on the other side had to be done on foot
after half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way helen's strength was spent and her breath was gone
she felt lightheaded
she could not get enough air
her feet felt like lead and her ridingcoat was a burden
a hundred times hot and wet and throbbing she was compelled to stop
always she had been a splendid walker and climber
and here to break up the long ride she was glad to be on her feet
but she could only drag one foot up after the other
then when her nose began to bleed she realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble
her heart however did not hurt her though she was conscious of an oppression on her breast
at last roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest verdure that it appeared impossible to cross
nevertheless he started down dismounting after a little way
helen found that leading ranger down was worse than riding him
he came fast and he would step right in her tracks
she was not quick enough to get away from him
twice he stepped on her foot and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and threw her flat
when he began to slide near the bottom helen had to run for her life
oh nell
isn'tthisgreat panted bo from somewhere ahead
boyourmind'sgone panted helen in reply
roy tried several places to climb out and failed in each
leading down the ravine for a hundred yards or more he essayed another attempt
here there had been a slide and in part the earth was bare
when he had worked up this he halted above and called  bad place
keep on the up side of the hosses  this appeared easier said than done
helen could not watch bo because ranger would not wait
he pulled at the bridle and snorted
faster you come the better called roy
helen could not see the sense of that but she tried
roy and bo had dug a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide
helen made the mistake of starting to follow in their tracks and when she realized this ranger was climbing fast almost dragging her and it was too late to get above
helen began to labor
she slid down right in front of ranger
the intelligent animal with a snort plunged out of the trail to keep from stepping on her
then he was above her
lookout down there yelled roy in warning
get on the up side  but that did not appear possible
the earth began to slide under ranger and that impeded helen's progress
he got in advance of her straining on the bridle
let go yelled roy
helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with ranger
he snorted fiercely and rearing high in a mighty plunge he gained solid ground
helen was buried to her knees but extricating herself she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther
bad cavein thet was roy's comment when at last she joined him and bo at the top
roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go
he rode to high ground and looked in all directions
to helen one way appeared as wild and rough as another and all was yellow green and black under the westering sun
roy rode a short distance in one direction then changed for another
presently he stopped
wal i'm shore turned round he said
you're not lost cried bo
reckon i've been thet for a couple of hours he replied cheerfully
never did ride across here i had the direction but i'm blamed now if i can tell which way thet was  helen gazed at him in consternation
lost she echoed
chapter ix  a silence ensued fraught with poignant fear for helen as she gazed into bo's whitening face
she read her sister's mind
bo was remembering tales of lost people who never were found
me an' milt get lost every day said roy
you don't suppose any man can know all this big country
it's nothin' for us to be lost  oh
i was lost when i was little said bo
wal i reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like  replied roy contritely
don't feel bad now
all i need is a peek at old baldy
then i'll have my bearin'
come on  helen's confidence returned as roy led off at a fast trot
he rode toward the westering sun keeping to the ridge they had ascended until once more he came out upon a promontory
old baldy loomed there blacker and higher and closer
the dark forest showed round yellow bare spots like parks
not so far off the track said roy as he wheeled his horse
we'll make camp in milt's senaca tonight  he led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude where the character of the forest changed
the trees were no longer pines but firs and spruce growing thin and exceedingly tall with few branches below the topmost foliage
so dense was this forest that twilight seemed to have come
travel was arduous
everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided and not a rod was there without a fallen tree
the horses laboring slowly sometimes sank kneedeep into the brown duff
gray moss festooned the treetrunks and an ambergreen moss grew thick on the rotting logs
helen loved this forest primeval
it was so still so dark so gloomy so full of shadows and shade and a dank smell of rotting wood and sweet fragrance of spruce
the great windfalls where trees were jammed together in dozens showed the savagery of the storms
wherever a single monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons jealous of one another fighting for place
even the trees fought one another
the forest was a place of mystery but its strife could be read by any eye
the lightnings had split firs clear to the roots and others it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk
time came however when the exceeding wildness of the forest in density and fallen timber made it imperative for helen to put all her attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity
so the pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her
thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless
roy led on and ranger followed while the shadows darkened under the trees
she was reeling in her saddle half blind and sick when roy called out cheerily that they were almost there
whatever his idea was to helen it seemed many miles that she followed him farther out of the heavytimbered forest down upon slopes of low spruce like evergreen which descended sharply to another level where dark shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low murmur of falling water and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful park full of a thick rich golden light of fastfading sunset
smell the smoke said roy
by solomon
if milt ain't here ahead of me  he rode on
helen's weary gaze took in the round senaca the circling black slopes leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the last flare of the sun then all the spirit left in her flashed up in thrilling wonder at this exquisite wild and colorful spot
horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing with them
roy led round a corner of the fringed bordering woodland and there under lofty trees shone a campfire
huge gray rocks loomed beyond and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain wall over which poured a thin lacy waterfall
as helen gazed in rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the amphitheater darkened
dale's tall form appeared
reckon you're late he said as with a comprehensive flash of eye he took in the three
milt i got lost replied roy
i feared as much you girls look like you'd done better to ride with me went on dale as he offered a hand to help bo off
she took it tried to get her foot out of the stirrups and then she slid from the saddle into dale's arms
he placed her on her feet and supporting her said solicitously a hundredmile ride in three days for a tenderfoot is somethin' your uncle al won't believe come walk if it kills you  whereupon he led bo very much as if he were teaching a child to walk
the fact that the voluble bo had nothing to say was significant to helen who was following with the assistance of roy
one of the huge rocks resembled a seashell in that it contained a hollow over which the widespreading shelf flared out
it reached toward branches of great pines
a spring burst from a crack in the solid rock
the campfire blazed under a pine and the blue column of smoke rose just in front of the shelving rock
packs were lying on the grass and some of them were open
there were no signs here of a permanent habitation of the hunter
but farther on were other huge rocks leaning cracked and forming caverns some of which perhaps he utilized
my camp is just back said dale as if he had read helen's mind
tomorrow we'll fix up comfortablelike round here for you girls  helen and bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them and the men went about their tasks
nellisn't thisa dream murmured bo
no child
it's realterribly real replied helen
now that we're herewith that awful ride overwe can think  it's so prettyhere yawned bo
i'd just as lief uncle al didn't find us very soon  bo
he's a sick man
think what the worry will be to him  i'll bet if he knows dale he won't be so worried  dale told us uncle al disliked him  pooh
what difference does that make
oh i don't know which i amhungrier or tireder  i couldn't eat tonight said helen wearily
when she stretched out she had a vague delicious sensation that that was the end of helen rayner and she was glad
above her through the lacy fernlike pineneedles she saw blue sky and a pale star just showing
twilight was stealing down swiftly
the silence was beautiful seemingly undisturbed by the soft silky dreamy fall of water
helen closed her eyes ready for sleep with the physical commotion within her body gradually yielding
in some places her bones felt as if they had come out through her flesh in others throbbed deepseated aches her muscles appeared slowly to subside to relax with the quivering twinges ceasing one by one through muscle and bone through all her body pulsed a burning current
bo's head dropped on helen's shoulder
sense became vague to helen
she lost the low murmur of the waterfall and then the sound or feeling of some one at the campfire
and her last conscious thought was that she tried to open her eyes and could not
when she awoke all was bright
the sun shone almost directly overhead
helen was astounded
bo lay wrapped in deep sleep her face flushed with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp
helen threw down the blankets and then gathering couragefor she felt as if her back was brokenshe endeavored to sit up
in vain
her spirit was willing but her muscles refused to act
it must take a violent spasmodic effort
she tried it with shut eyes and succeeding sat there trembling
the commotion she had made in the blankets awoke bo and she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight
hellonell
do i have toget up she asked sleepily
can you queried helen
can i what bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her sister
whyget up  i'd like to know why not retorted bo as she made the effort
she got one arm and shoulder up only to flop back like a crippled thing
and she uttered the most piteous little moan
i'm dead
i knowi am  well if you're going to be a western girl you'd better have spunk enough to move  ahuh ejaculated bo
then she rolled over not without groans and once upon her face she raised herself on her hands and turned to a sitting posture
where's everybody
oh nell it's perfectly lovely here
paradise  helen looked around
a fire was smoldering
no one was in sight
wonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix it upon nearby objects
a beautiful little green tent or shack had been erected out of spruce boughs
it had a slanting roof that sloped all the way from a ridgepole to the ground half of the opening in front was closed as were the sides
the spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in the same direction giving it a smooth compact appearance actually as if it had grown there
that leanto wasn't there last night inquired bo
i didn't see it
leanto
where'd you get that name  it's western my dear
i'll bet they put it up for us sure i see our bags inside
let's get up
it must be late  the girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping each other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly
they were delighted with the spruce leanto
it faced the open and stood just under the widespreading shelf of rock
the tiny outlet from the spring flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone to fall into a little pool
the floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth all laid one way smooth and springy and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating
helen and bo opened their baggage and what with use of the cold water brush and comb and clean blouses they made themselves feel as comfortable as possible considering the excruciating aches
then they went out to the campfire
helen's eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand
then simultaneously with bo's cry of delight helen saw a beautiful doe approaching under the trees
dale walked beside it
you sure had a long sleep was the hunter's greeting
i reckon you both look better  good morning
or is it afternoon
we're just able to move about said helen
i could ride declared bo stoutly
oh nell look at the deer
it's coming to me  the doe had hung back a little as dale reached the campfire
it was a gray slender creature smooth as silk with great dark eyes
it stood a moment long ears erect and then with a graceful little trot came up to bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand
all about it except the beautiful soft eyes seemed wild and yet it was as tame as a kitten
then suddenly as bo fondled the long ears it gave a start and breaking away ran back out of sight under the pines
what frightened it asked bo
dale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock
there twenty feet from the ground curled up on a ledge lay a huge tawny animal with a face like that of a cat
she's afraid of tom replied dale
recognizes him as a hereditary foe i guess
i can't make friends of them  oh
so that's tomthe pet lion exclaimed bo
ugh
no wonder that deer ran off  how long has he been up there queried helen gazing fascinated at dale's famous pet
i couldn't say
tom comes an' goes replied dale
but i sent him up there last night  and he was thereperfectly freeright over uswhile we slept burst out bo
yes
an' i reckon you slept the safer for that  of all things
nell isn't he a monster
but he doesn't look like a lionan african lion
he's a panther
i saw his like at the circus once  he's a cougar said dale
the panther is long and slim
tom is not only long but thick an' round
i've had him four years
an' he was a kitten no bigger 'n my fist when i got him  is he perfectly tamesafe asked helen anxiously
i've never told anybody that tom was safe but he is replied dale
you can absolutely believe it
a wild cougar wouldn't attack a man unless cornered or starved
an' tom is like a big kitten  the beast raised his great catlike face with its sleepy halfshut eyes and looked down upon them
shall i call him down inquired dale
for once bo did not find her voice
let usget a little more used to himat a distance replied helen with a little laugh
if he comes to you just rub his head an' you'll see how tame he is  said dale
reckon you're both hungry  not so very returned helen aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon her
well i am vouchsafed bo
soon as the turkey's done we'll eat
my camp is round between the rocks
i'll call you  not until his broad back was turned did helen notice that the hunter looked different
then she saw he wore a lighter cleaner suit of buckskin with no coat and instead of the highheeled horseman's boots he wore moccasins and leggings
the change made him appear more lithe
nell i don't know what you think but i call him handsome declared bo
helen had no idea what she thought
let's try to walk some she suggested
so they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few rods from their camp
this point was close to the edge of the park from which there was an unobstructed view
my
what a place exclaimed bo with eyes wide and round
oh beautiful breathed helen
an unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first
out of the black spruce slopes shone patches of aspens gloriously red and gold and low down along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park not yet so blazing as those above but purple and yellow and white in the sunshine
masses of silver spruce like trees in moonlight bordered the park sending out here and there an isolated tree sharp as a spear with underbranches close to the ground
long goldengreen grass resembling halfripe wheat covered the entire floor of the park gently waving to the wind
above sheered the black goldpatched slopes steep and unscalable rising to buttresses of dark ironhued rock
and to the east circled the rows of cliffbench gray and old and fringed splitting at the top in the notch where the lacy slumberous waterfall like white smoke fell and vanished to reappear in wider sheet of lace only to fall and vanish again in the green depths
it was a verdant valley deepset in the mountain walls wild and sad and lonesome
the waterfall dominated the spirit of the place dreamy and sleepy and tranquil it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind and lulled with another and sometimes died out altogether only to come again in soft strange roar
paradise park whispered bo to herself
a call from dale disturbed their raptures
turning they hobbled with eager but painful steps in the direction of a larger campfire situated to the right of the great rock that sheltered their leanto
no hut or house showed there and none was needed
hidingplaces and homes for a hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs split off in bygone ages from the mountain wall above
a few stately pines stood out from the rocks and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown brook
this camp was only a step from the leanto round the corner of a huge rock yet it had been out of sight
here indeed was evidence of a hunter's homepelts and skins and antlers a neat pile of split firewood a long ledge of rock well sheltered and loaded with bags like a huge pantryshelf packs and ropes and saddles tools and weapons and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp
hyaryou git shouted dale and he threw a stick at something
a bear cub scampered away in haste
he was small and woolly and brown and he grunted as he ran
soon he halted
that's bud said dale as the girls came up
guess he near starved in my absence
an' now he wants everythin' especially the sugar
we don't have sugar often up here  isn't he dear
oh i love him cried bo
come back bud
come buddie  the cub however kept his distance watching dale with bright little eyes
where's mr roy asked helen
roy's gone
he was sorry not to say goodby
but it's important he gets down in the pines on anson's trail
he'll hang to anson an' in case they get near pine he'll ride in to see where your uncle is  what do you expect questioned helen gravely
'most anythin' he replied
al i reckon knows now
maybe he's rustlin' into the mountains by this time
if he meets up with anson well an' good for roy won't be far off
an' sure if he runs across roy why they'll soon be here
but if i were you i wouldn't count on seein' your uncle very soon
i'm sorry
i've done my best
it sure is a bad deal  don't think me ungracious replied helen hastily
how plainly he had intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be compelled to accept his hospitality
you are goodkind
i owe you much
i'll be eternally grateful  dale straightened as he looked at her
his glance was intent piercing
he seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent
no need for him to say he had never before been spoken to like that
you may have to stay here with mefor weeksmaybe monthsif we've the bad luck to get snowed in he said slowly as if startled at this deduction
you're safe here
no sheepthief could ever find this camp
i'll take risks to get you safe into al's hands
but i'm goin' to be pretty sure about what i'm doin'
sothere's plenty to eat an' it's a pretty place  pretty
why it's grand exclaimed bo
i've called it paradise park  paradise park he repeated weighing the words
you've named it an' also the creek
paradise creek
i've been here twelve years with no fit name for my home till you said that  oh that pleases me returned bo with shining eyes
eat now said dale
an' i reckon you'll like that turkey  there was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming fragrant pansroast turkey hot biscuits and gravy mashed potatoes as white as if prepared at home stewed dried apples and butter and coffee
this bounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls when they had once tasted the roast wild turkey then milt dale had occasion to blush at their encomiums
i hopeuncle aldoesn't come for a month declared bo as she tried to get her breath
there was a brown spot on her nose and one on each cheek suspiciously close to her mouth
dale laughed
it was pleasant to hear him for his laugh seemed unused and deep as if it came from tranquil depths
won't you eat with us asked helen
reckon i will he said it'll save time an' hot grub tastes better  quite an interval of silence ensued which presently was broken by dale
here comes tom  helen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent seen erect on allfours approaching with slow sinuous grace
his color was tawny with spots of whitish gray
he had bowlegs big and round and furry and a huge head with great tawny eyes
no matter how tame he was said to be he looked wild
like a dog he walked right up and it so happened that he was directly behind bo within reach of her when she turned
oh lord cried bo and up went both of her hands in one of which was a huge piece of turkey
tom took it not viciously but nevertheless with a snap that made helen jump
as if by magic the turkey vanished
and tom took a closer step toward bo
her expression of fright changed to consternation
he stole my turkey  tom come here ordered dale sharply
the cougar glided round rather sheepishly
now lie down an' behave  tom crouched on allfours his head resting on his paws with his beautiful tawny eyes light and piercing fixed upon the hunter
don't grab said dale holding out a piece of turkey
whereupon tom took it less voraciously
as it happened the little bear cub saw this transaction and he plainly indicated his opinion of the preference shown to tom
oh the dear exclaimed bo
he means it's not fair come budcome on  but bud would not approach the group until called by dale
then he scrambled to them with every manifestation of delight
bo almost forgot her own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him
tom plainly showed his jealousy of bud and bud likewise showed his fear of the great cat
helen could not believe the evidence of her eyesthat she was in the woods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet wildflavored meatthat a fullgrown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear sat on the otherthat a strange hunter a man of the forest there in his lonely and isolated fastness appealed to the romance in her and interested her as no one else she had ever met
when the wonderful meal was at last finished bo enticed the bear cub around to the camp of the girls and there soon became great comrades with him
helen watching bo play was inclined to envy her
no matter where bo was placed she always got something out of it
she adapted herself
she who could have a good time with almost any one or anything would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park of wild wonders
but merely objective actionsmerely physical movements had never yet contented helen
she could run and climb and ride and play with hearty and healthy abandon but those things would not suffice long for her and her mind needed food
helen was a thinker
one reason she had desired to make her home in the west was that by taking up a life of the open of action she might think and dream and brood less
and here she was in the wild west after the three most strenuously active days of her career and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it upon herself and upon all she saw
what can i do she asked bo almost helplessly
why rest you silly retorted bo
you walk like an old crippled woman with only one leg  helen hoped the comparison was undeserved but the advice was sound
the blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt comfortably warm in the sunshine
the breeze was slow languorous fragrant and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall like a melody of bees
helen made a pillow and lay down to rest
the green pineneedles so thin and fine in their crisscross network showed clearly against the blue sky
she looked in vain for birds
then her gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great amphitheater and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness how far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere
a black eagle sweeping along looked of tiny size and yet he was far under the heights above
how pleasant she fancied it to be up there
and drowsy fancy lulled her to sleep
helen slept all afternoon and upon awakening toward sunset found bo curled beside her
dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket also he had built a campfire
the air was growing keen and cold
later when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats beside the fire dale came over apparently to visit them
i reckon you can't sleep all the time he said
an' bein' city girls you'll get lonesome  lonesome echoed helen
the idea of her being lonesome here had not occurred to her
i've thought that all out went on dale as he sat down indian fashion before the blaze
it's natural you'd find time drag up here bein' used to lots of people an' goin'son an' work an' all girls like  i'd never be lonesome here replied helen with her direct force
dale did not betray surprise but he showed that his mistake was something to ponder over
excuse me he said presently as his gray eyes held hers
that's how i had it
as i remember girlsan' it doesn't seem long since i left homemost of them would die of lonesomeness up here then he addressed himself to bo
how about you
you see i figured you'd be the one that liked it an' your sister the one who wouldn't  i won't get lonesome very soon replied bo
i'm glad
it worried me somenot ever havin' girls as company before
an' in a day or so when you're rested i'll help you pass the time  bo's eyes were full of flashing interest and helen asked him how  it was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or ironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest
but as a challenge he took it
how he repeated and a strange smile flitted across his face
why by givin' you rides an' climbs to beautiful places
an' then if you're interested' to show you how little socalled civilized people know of nature  helen realized then that whatever his calling hunter or wanderer or hermit he was not uneducated even if he appeared illiterate
i'll be happy to learn from you she said
me too chimed in bo
you can't tell too much to any one from missouri  he smiled and that warmed helen to him for then he seemed less removed from other people
about this hunter there began to be something of the very nature of which he spokea stillness aloofness an unbreakable tranquillity a cold clear spirit like that in the mountain air a physical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the strength of the pines
i'll bet i can tell you more 'n you'll ever remember he said
what 'll you bet retorted bo
well more roast turkey againstsay somethin' nice when you're safe an' home to your uncle al's runnin' his ranch  agreed
nell you hear  helen nodded her head
all right
we'll leave it to nell began dale half seriously
now i'll tell you first for the fun of passin' time we'll ride an' race my horses out in the park
an' we'll fish in the brooks an' hunt in the woods
there's an old silvertip around that you can see me kill
an' we'll climb to the peaks an' see wonderful sights
so much for that
now if you really want to learnor if you only want me to tell youwell that's no matter
only i'll win the bet
you'll see how this park lies in the crater of a volcano an' was once full of wateran' how the snow blows in on one side in winter a hundred feet deep when there's none on the other
an' the treeshow they grow an' live an' fight one another an' depend on one another an' protect the forest from stormwinds
an' how they hold the water that is the fountains of the great rivers
an' how the creatures an' things that live in them or on them are good for them an' neither could live without the other
an' then i'll show you my pets tame an' untamed an' tell you how it's man that makes any creature wildhow easy they are to tamean' how they learn to love you
an' there's the life of the forest the strife of ithow the bear lives an' the cats an' the wolves an' the deer
you'll see how cruel nature is how savage an' wild the wolf or cougar tears down the deerhow a wolf loves fresh hot blood an' how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck
an' you'll see that this cruelty of naturethis work of the wolf an' cougaris what makes the deer so beautiful an' healthy an' swift an' sensitive
without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an' die out
an' you'll see how this principle works out among all creatures of the forest
strife
it's the meanin' of all creation an' the salvation
if you're quick to see you'll learn that the nature here in the wilds is the same as that of menonly men are no longer cannibals
trees fight to livebirds fightanimals fightmen fight
they all live off one another
an' it's this fightin' that brings them all closer an' closer to bein' perfect
but nothin' will ever be perfect  but how about religion interrupted helen earnestly
nature has a religion an' it's to liveto growto reproduce each of its kind  but that is not god or the immortality of the soul declared helen
well it's as close to god an' immortality as nature ever gets  oh you would rob me of my religion  no i just talk as i see life replied dale reflectively as he poked a stick into the red embers of the fire
maybe i have a religion
i don't know
but it's not the kind you havenot the bible kind
that kind doesn't keep the men in pine an' snowdrop an' all oversheepmen an' ranchers an' farmers an' travelers such as i've knownthe religion they profess doesn't keep them from lyin' cheatin' stealin' an' killin'
i reckon no man who lives as i dowhich perhaps is my religionwill lie or cheat or steal or kill unless it's to kill in selfdefense or like i'd do if snake anson would ride up here now
my religion maybe is love of lifewild life as it was in the beginnin'an' the wind that blows secrets from everywhere an' the water that sings all day an' night an' the stars that shine constant an' the trees that speak somehow an' the rocks that aren't dead
i'm never alone here or on the trails
there's somethin' unseen but always with me
an' that's it
call it god if you like
but what stalls me iswhere was that spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas
where will that spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this globe an' it hangs dead in space like the moon
that time will come
there's no waste in nature
not the littlest atom is destroyed
it changes that's all as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an' feel somethin' that's heat come out of it
where does that go
it's not lost
nothin' is lost
so the beautiful an' savin' thought is maybe all rock an' wood water an' blood an' flesh are resolved back into the elements to come to life somewhere again sometime  oh what you say is wonderful but it's terrible exclaimed helen
he had struck deep into her soul
terrible
i reckon he replied sadly
then ensued a little interval of silence
milt dale i lose the bet declared bo with earnestness behind her frivolity
i'd forgotten that
reckon i talked a lot he said apologetically
you see i don't get much chance to talk except to myself or tom
years ago when i found the habit of silence settlin' down on me i took to thinkin' out loud an' talkin' to anythin'  i could listen to you all night returned bo dreamily
do you readdo you have books inquired helen suddenly
yes i read tolerable well a good deal better than i talk or write  he replied
i went to school till i was fifteen
always hated study but liked to read
years ago an old friend of mine down here at pinewidow cassshe gave me a lot of old books
an' i packed them up here
winter's the time i read  conversation lagged after that except for desultory remarks and presently dale bade the girls good night and left them
helen watched his tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines and after he had disappeared she still stared
nell called bo shrilly
i've called you three times
i want to go to bed  oh
ii was thinking rejoined helen half embarrassed half wondering at herself
i didn't hear you  i should smile you didn't retorted bo
wish you could just have seen your eyes
nell do you want me to tell you something
whyyes said helen rather feebly
she did not at all when bo talked like that
you're going to fall in love with that wild hunter declared bo in a voice that rang like a bell
helen was not only amazed but enraged
she caught her breath preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind
bo went calmly on
i can feel it in my bones  bo you're a little foola sentimental romancing gushy little fool  retorted helen
all you seem to hold in your head is some rot about love
to hear you talk one would think there's nothing else in the world but love  bo's eyes were bright shrewd affectionate and laughing as she bent their steady gaze upon helen
nell that's just it
there is nothing else    chapter x  the night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for helen to believe that hours had passed
bo appeared livelier this morning with less complaint of aches
nell you've got color exclaimed bo
and your eyes are bright
isn't the morning perfectly lovely
couldn't you get drunk on that air
i smell flowers
and oh
i'm hungry  bo our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your appetite holds said helen as she tried to keep her hair out of her eyes while she laced her boots
look
there's a big doga hound  helen looked as bo directed and saw a hound of unusually large proportions black and tan in color with long drooping ears
curiously he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at them
his head was noble his eyes shone dark and sad
he seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly
hello doggie
come right inwe won't hurt you called bo but without enthusiasm
this made helen laugh
bo you're simply delicious she said
you're afraid of that dog  sure
wonder if he's dale's
of course he must be  presently the hound trotted away out of sight
when the girls presented themselves at the campfire they espied their curious canine visitor lying down
his ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground
i sent pedro over to wake you girls up said dale after greeting them
did he scare you  pedro
so that's his name
no he didn't exactly scare me
he did nell though
she's an awful tenderfoot replied bo
he's a splendidlooking dog said helen ignoring her sister's sally
i love dogs
will he make friends  he's shy an' wild
you see when i leave camp he won't hang around
he an' tom are jealous of each other
i had a pack of hounds an' lost all but pedro on account of tom
i think you can make friends with pedro
try it  whereupon helen made overtures to pedro and not wholly in vain
the dog was matured of almost stern aloofness and manifestly not used to people
his deep winedark eyes seemed to search helen's soul
they were honest and wise with a strange sadness
he looks intelligent observed helen as she smoothed the long dark ears
that hound is nigh human responded dale
come an' while you eat i'll tell you about pedro  dale had gotten the hound as a pup from a mexican sheepherder who claimed he was part california bloodhound
he grew up becoming attached to dale
in his younger days he did not get along well with dale's other pets and dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley
pedro was back in dale's camp next day
from that day dale began to care more for the hound but he did not want to keep him for various reasons chief of which was the fact that pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half the time to shift for himself
that fall dale had need to go to the farthest village snowdrop where he left pedro with a friend
then dale rode to show down and pine and the camp of the beemans' and with them he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles over into new mexico
the snow was flying when dale got back to his camp in the mountains
and there was pedro gaunt and worn overjoyed to welcome him home
roy beeman visited dale that october and told that dale's friend in snowdrop had not been able to keep pedro
he broke a chain and scaled a tenfoot fence to escape
he trailed dale to show down where one of dale's friends recognizing the hound caught him and meant to keep him until dale's return
but pedro refused to eat
it happened that a freighter was going out to the beeman camp and dale's friend boxed pedro up and put him on the wagon
pedro broke out of the box returned to show down took up dale's trail to pine and then on to the beeman camp
that was as far as roy could trace the movements of the hound
but he believed and so did dale that pedro had trailed them out on the wildhorse hunt
the following spring dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at whose camp he and the beemans had rested on the way into new mexico
it appeared that after dale had left this camp pedro had arrived and another mexican herder had stolen the hound
but pedro got away
an' he was here when i arrived concluded dale smiling
i never wanted to get rid of him after that
he's turned out to be the finest dog i ever knew
he knows what i say
he can almost talk
an' i swear he can cry
he does whenever i start off without him  how perfectly wonderful exclaimed bo
aren't animals great
but i love horses best  it seemed to helen that pedro understood they were talking about him for he looked ashamed and swallowed hard and dropped his gaze
she knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners
this story of dale's however was stranger than any she had ever heard
tom the cougar put in an appearance then and there was scarcely love in the tawny eyes he bent upon pedro
but the hound did not deign to notice him
tom sidled up to bo who sat on the farther side of the tarpaulin tablecloth and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast
gee
i love the look of him she said
but when he's close he makes my flesh creep  beasts are as queer as people observed dale
they take likes an' dislikes
i believe tom has taken a shine to you an' pedro begins to be interested in your sister
i can tell  where's bud inquired bo
he's asleep or around somewhere
now soon as i get the work done what would you girls like to do  ride declared bo eagerly
aren't you sore an' stiff  i am that
but i don't care
besides when i used to go out to my uncle's farm near saint joe i always found riding to be a cure for aches  sure is if you can stand it
an' what will your sister like to do  returned dale turning to helen
oh i'll rest and watch you folksand dream replied helen
but after you've rested you must be active said dale seriously
you must do things
it doesn't matter what just as long as you don't sit idle  why queried helen in surprise
why not be idle here in this beautiful wild place
just to dream away the hoursthe days
i could do it  but you mustn't
it took me years to learn how bad that was for me
an' right now i would love nothin' more than to forget my work my horses an' petseverythin' an' just lay around seein' an' feelin'  seeing and feeling
yes that must be what i mean
but whywhat is it
there are the beauty and colorthe wild shaggy slopesthe gray cliffsthe singing windthe lulling waterthe cloudsthe sky
and the silence loneliness sweetness of it all  it's a driftin' back
what i love to do an' yet fear most
it's what makes a lone hunter of a man
an' it can grow so strong that it binds a man to the wilds  how strange murmured helen
but that could never bind me
why i must live and fulfil my mission my work in the civilized world  it seemed to helen that dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest words
the ways of nature are strange he said
i look at it different
nature's just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to be civilized
an' if nature won you would carry out her design all the better  this hunter's talk shocked helen and yet stimulated her mind
mea savage
oh no she exclaimed
but if that were possible what would nature's design be  you spoke of your mission in life he replied
a woman's mission is to have children
the female of any species has only one missionto reproduce its kind
an' nature has only one missiontoward greater strength virility efficiencyabsolute perfection which is unattainable  what of mental and spiritual development of man and woman asked helen
both are direct obstacles to the design of nature
nature is physical
to create for limitless endurance for eternal life
that must be nature's inscrutable design
an' why she must fail  but the soul whispered helen
ah
when you speak of the soul an' i speak of life we mean the same
you an' i will have some talks while you're here
i must brush up my thoughts  so must i it seems said helen with a slow smile
she had been rendered grave and thoughtful
but i guess i'll risk dreaming under the pines  bo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes
nell it'd take a thousand years to make a savage of you she said
but a week will do for me  bo you were one before you left saint joe replied helen
don't you remember that schoolteacher barnes who said you were a wildcat and an indian mixed
he spanked you with a ruler  never
he missed me retorted bo with red in her cheeks
nell i wish you'd not tell things about me when i was a kid  that was only two years ago expostulated helen in mild surprise
suppose it was
i was a kid all right
i'll bet you bo broke up abruptly and tossing her head she gave tom a pat and then ran away around the corner of cliff wall
helen followed leisurely
say nell said bo when helen arrived at their little green ledgepole hut do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your theories  maybe
i'll admit he amazes meand affronts me too i'm afraid  replied helen
what surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack of schooling he's not raw or crude
he's elemental  sister dear wake up
the man's wonderful
you can learn more from him than you ever learned in your life
so can i i always hated books anyway  when a little later dale approached carrying some bridles the hound pedro trotted at his heels
i reckon you'd better ride the horse you had he said to bo
whatever you say
but i hope you let me ride them all by and by  sure
i've a mustang out there you'll like
but he pitches a little  he rejoined and turned away toward the park
the hound looked after him and then at helen
come pedro
stay with me called helen
dale hearing her motioned the hound back
obediently pedro trotted to her still shy and soberly watchful as if not sure of her intentions but with something of friendliness about him now
helen found a soft restful seat in the sun facing the park and there composed herself for what she felt would be slow sweet idle hours
pedro curled down beside her
the tall form of dale stalked across the park out toward the straggling horses
again she saw a deer grazing among them
how erect and motionless it stood watching dale
presently it bounded away toward the edge of the forest
some of the horses whistled and ran kicking heels high in the air
the shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness
gee
look at them go exclaimed bo gleefully coming up to where helen sat
bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pineneedles and stretched herself languorously like a lazy kitten
there was something feline in her lithe graceful outline
she lay flat and looked up through the pines
wouldn't it be great now she murmured dreamily half to herself if that las vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come and then an earthquake would shut us up here in this paradise valley so we'd never get out  bo
what would mother say to such talk as that gasped helen
but nell wouldn't it be great  it would be terrible  oh there never was any romance in you nell rayner replied bo
that very thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country of wild places
you need not tell me
sure it's happened
with the cliffdwellers and the indians and then white people
every place i look makes me feel that
nell you'd have to see people in the moon through a telescope before you'd believe that  i'm practical and sensible thank goodness  but for the sake of argument protested bo with flashing eyes suppose it might happen
just to please me suppose we did get shut up here with dale and that cowboy we saw from the train
shut in without any hope of ever climbing out what would you do
would you give up and pine away and die
or would you fight for life and whatever joy it might mean  selfpreservation is the first instinct replied helen surprised at a strange deep thrill in the depths of her
i'd fight for life of course  yes
well really when i think seriously i don't want anything like that to happen
but just the same if it did happen i would glory in it  while they were talking dale returned with the horses
can you bridle an' saddle your own horse he asked
no
i'm ashamed to say i can't replied bo
time to learn then
come on
watch me first when i saddle mine  bo was all eyes while dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and then with slow plain action readjusted it
next he smoothed the back of the horse shook out the blanket and folding it half over he threw it in place being careful to explain to bo just the right position
he lifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place and then he tightened the cinches
now you try he said
according to helen's judgment bo might have been a western girl all her days
but dale shook his head and made her do it over
that was better
of course the saddle is too heavy for you to sling it up
you can learn that with a light one
now put the bridle on again
don't be afraid of your hands
he won't bite
slip the bit in sideways
there
now let's see you mount  when bo got into the saddle dale continued you went up quick an' light but the wrong way
watch me  bo had to mount several times before dale was satisfied
then he told her to ride off a little distance
when bo had gotten out of earshot dale said to helen she'll take to a horse like a duck takes to water  then mounting he rode out after her
helen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round the grassy park and rather regretted she had not gone with them
eventually bo rode back to dismount and fling herself down redcheeked and radiant with disheveled hair and curls damp on her temples
how alive she seemed
helen's senses thrilled with the grace and charm and vitality of this surprising sister and she was aware of a sheer physical joy in her presence
bo rested but she did not rest long
she was soon off to play with bud
then she coaxed the tame doe to eat out of her hand
she dragged helen off for wild flowers curious and thoughtless by turns
and at length she fell asleep quickly in a way that reminded helen of the childhood now gone forever
dale called them to dinner about four o'clock as the sun was reddening the western rampart of the park
helen wondered where the day had gone
the hours had flown swiftly serenely bringing her scarcely a thought of her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible discovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her
after she realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and indescribable feeling of what dale had meant about dreaming the hours away
the nature of paradise park was inimical to the kind of thought that had habitually been hers
she found the new thought absorbing yet when she tried to name it she found that after all she had only felt
at the meal hour she was more than usually quiet
she saw that dale noticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention
he succeeded but she did not choose to let him see that
she strolled away alone to her seat under the pine
bo passed her once and cried tantalizingly  my nell but you're growing romantic  never before in helen's life had the beauty of the evening star seemed so exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so charged with loneliness
it was their environmentthe accompaniment of wild wolfmourn of the murmuring waterfall of this strange man of the forest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home
next morning her energy having returned helen shared bo's lesson in bridling and saddling her horse and in riding
bo however rode so fast and so hard that for helen to share her company was impossible
and dale interested and amused yet anxious spent most of his time with bo
it was thus that helen rode all over the park alone
she was astonished at its size when from almost any point it looked so small
the atmosphere deceived her
how clearly she could see
and she began to judge distance by the size of familiar things
a horse looked at across the longest length of the park seemed very small indeed
here and there she rode upon dark swift little brooks exquisitely clear and ambercolored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass
these all ran one way and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound under the cliffs at the west end and plunged to an outlet in narrow clefts
when dale and bo came to her once she made inquiry and she was surprised to learn from dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in the rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain
sometime he would take them to the lake it formed
over the mountain asked helen again remembering that she must regard herself as a fugitive
will it be safe to leave our hidingplace
i forget so often why we are here  we would be better hidden over there than here replied dale
the valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge
an' don't worry about bein' found
i told you roy beeman is watchin' anson an' his gang
roy will keep between them an' us  helen was reassured yet there must always linger in the background of her mind a sense of dread
in spite of this she determined to make the most of her opportunity
bo was a stimulus
and so helen spent the rest of that day riding and tagging after her sister
the next day was less hard on helen
activity rest eating and sleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her
she had really never known them as strange joys
she rode she walked she climbed a little she dozed under her pinetree she worked helping dale at campfire tasks and when night came she said she did not know herself
that fact haunted her in vague deep dreams
upon awakening she forgot her resolve to study herself
that day passed
and then several more went swiftly before she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe might last for weeks and even months
it was afternoon that helen loved best of all the time of the day
the sunrise was fresh beautiful the morning was windy fragrant the sunset was rosy glorious the twilight was sad changing and night seemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep
but the afternoon when nothing changed when all was serene when time seemed to halt that was her choice and her solace
one afternoon she had camp all to herself
bo was riding
dale had climbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see any smoke from campfire
bud was nowhere to be seen nor any of the other pets
tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in the sun after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species
pedro had not been seen for a night and a day a fact that helen had noted with concern
however she had forgotten him and therefore was the more surprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs
why pedro
you have been fighting
come here she called
the hound did not look guilty
he limped to her and held up his right fore paw
the action was unmistakable
helen examined the injured member and presently found a piece of what looked like musselshell embedded deeply between the toes
the wound was swollen bloody and evidently very painful
pedro whined
helen had to exert all the strength of her fingers to pull it out
then pedro howled
but immediately he showed his gratitude by licking her hand
helen bathed his paw and bound it up
when dale returned she related the incident and showing the piece of shell she asked where did that come from
are there shells in the mountains  once this country was under the sea replied dale
i've found things that 'd make you wonder  under the sea ejaculated helen
it was one thing to have read of such a strange fact but a vastly different one to realize it here among these lofty peaks
dale was always showing her something or telling her something that astounded her
look here he said one day
what do you make of that little bunch of aspens  they were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a pinetree
the forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling lines of spruce and groves of aspen
the little clump of aspens did not differ from hundreds helen had seen
i don't make anything particularly of it replied helen dubiously
just a tiny grove of aspenssome very small some larger but none very big
but it's pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering and quivering  it doesn't make you think of a fight  fight
no it certainly does not replied helen
well it's as good an example of fight of strife of selfishness as you will find in the forest he said
now come over you an' bo an' let me show you what i mean  come on nell cried bo with enthusiasm
he'll open our eyes some more  nothing loath helen went with them to the little clump of aspens
about a hundred altogether said dale
they're pretty well shaded by the spruces but they get the sunlight from east an' south
these little trees all came from the same seedlings
they're all the same age
four of them stand say ten feet or more high an' they're as large around as my wrist
here's one that's largest
see how fullfoliaged he ishow he stands over most of the others but not so much over these four next to him
they all stand close together very close you see
most of them are no larger than my thumb
look how few branches they have an' none low down
look at how few leaves
do you see how all the branches stand out toward the east an' southhow the leaves of course face the same way
see how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree
that's a fight for the sunlight
here are onetwothree dead trees
look i can snap them off
an' now look down under them
here are little trees five feet highfour feet highdown to these only a foot high
look how pale delicate fragile unhealthy
they get so little sunshine
they were born with the other trees but did not get an equal start
position gives the advantage perhaps  dale led the girls around the little grove illustrating his words by action
he seemed deeply in earnest
you understand it's a fight for water an' sun
but mostly sun because if the leaves can absorb the sun the tree an' roots will grow to grasp the needed moisture
shade is deathslow death to the life of trees
these little aspens are fightin' for place in the sunlight
it is a merciless battle
they push an' bend one another's branches aside an' choke them
only perhaps half of these aspens will survive to make one of the larger clumps such as that one of fullgrown trees over there
one season will give advantage to this saplin' an' next year to that one
a few seasons' advantage to one assures its dominance over the others
but it is never sure of holdin' that dominance
an 'if wind or storm or a stronggrowin' rival does not overthrow it then sooner or later old age will
for there is absolute and continual fight
what is true of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an' of all plant life in the forest
what is most wonderful to me is the tenacity of life  and next day dale showed them an even more striking example of this mystery of nature
he guided them on horseback up one of the thick verdantwooded slopes calling their attention at various times to the different growths until they emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant and dwarfed
at the edge of timberline he showed a gnarled and knotted sprucetree twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce bent and stormblasted with almost bare branches all reaching one' way
the tree was a specter
it stood alone
it had little green upon it
there seemed something tragic about its contortions
but it was alive and strong
it had no rivals to take sun or moisture
its enemies were the snow and wind and cold of the heights
helen felt as the realization came to her the knowledge dale wished to impart that it was as sad as wonderful and as mysterious as it was inspiring
at that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of lifethe pain and the joyin helen's heart
these strange facts were going to teach herto transform her
and even if they hurt she welcomed them
chapter xi  i'll ride you if it breaksmy neck panted bo passionately shaking her gloved fist at the gray pony
dale stood near with a broad smile on his face
helen was within earshot watching from the edge of the park and she felt so fascinated and frightened that she could not call out for bo to stop
the little gray mustang was a beauty cleanlimbed and racy with long black mane and tail and a fine spirited head
there was a blanket strapped on his back but no saddle
bo held the short halter that had been fastened in a hackamore knot round his nose
she wore no coat her blouse was covered with grass and seeds and it was open at the neck her hair hung loose and disheveled one side of her face bore a stain of grass and dirt and a suspicion of blood the other was red and white her eyes blazed beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her cheeks
as she began to strain on the halter pulling herself closer to the fiery pony the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and strong
bo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride dale's mustang and she was furious
the mustang did not appear to be vicious or mean
but he was spirited tricky mischievous and he had thrown her six times
the scene of bo's defeat was at the edge of the park where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall
it also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang obviously placing him at a disadvantage
dale did not bridle him because he had not been broken to a bridle and though it was harder for bo to try to ride him bareback there was less risk of her being hurt
bo had begun in all eagerness and enthusiasm loving and petting the mustang which she named pony she had evidently anticipated an adventure but her smiling resolute face had denoted confidence
pony had stood fairly well to be mounted and then had pitched and tossed until bo had slid off or been upset or thrown
after each fall bo bounced up with less of a smile and more of spirit until now the western passion to master a horse had suddenly leaped to life within her
it was no longer fun no more a daring circus trick to scare helen and rouse dale's admiration
the issue now lay between bo and the mustang
pony reared snorting tossing his head and pawing with front feet
pull him down yelled dale
bo did not have much weight but she had strength an she hauled with all her might finally bringing him down
now hold hard an' take up rope an' get in to him called dale
good
you're sure not afraid of him
he sees that
now hold him talk to him tell him you're goin' to ride him
pet him a little
an' when he quits shakin' grab his mane an' jump up an' slide a leg over him
then hook your feet under him hard as you can an' stick on  if helen had not been so frightened for bo she would have been able to enjoy her other sensations
creeping cold thrills chased over her as bo supple and quick slid an arm and a leg over pony and straightened up on him with a defiant cry
pony jerked his head down brought his feet together in one jump and began to bounce
bo got the swing of him this time and stayed on
you're ridin' him yelled dale
now squeeze hard with your knees
crack him over the head with your rope that's the way
hang on now an' you'll have him beat  the mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to dale and helen tearing up the moss and grass
several times he tossed bo high but she slid back to grip him again with her legs and he could not throw her
suddenly he raised his head and bolted
dale answered bo's triumphant cry
but pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell throwing bo far over his head
as luck would have itgood luck dale afterward saidshe landed in a boggy place and the force of her momentum was such that she slid several yards face down in wet moss and black ooze
helen uttered a scream and ran forward
bo was getting to her knees when dale reached her
he helped her up and half led half carried her out of the boggy place
bo was not recognizable
from head to foot she was dripping black ooze
oh bo
are you hurt cried helen
evidently bo's mouth was full of mud
ppsutt
ough
whew she sputtered
hurt
no
can't you see what i lit in
dale the sunofagun didn't throw me
he fell and i went over his head  right
you sure rode him
an' he tripped an' slung you a mile replied dale
it's lucky you lit in that bog  lucky
with eyes and nose stopped up
oooo
i'm full of mud
and my nicenew ridingsuit  bo's tones indicated that she was ready to cry
helen realizing bo had not been hurt began to laugh
her sister was the funniestlooking object that had ever come before her eyes
nell raynerare youlaughingat me demanded bo in most righteous amaze and anger
me laughing
nnever bo replied helen
can't you see i'm justjust  see
you idiot
my eyes are full of mud flashed bo
but i hear you
i'lli'll get even  dale was laughing too but noiselessly and bo being blind for the moment could not be aware of that
by this time they had reached camp
helen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before
when helen forgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing matter
dale's big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and wetting it at the spring began to wipe the mud off bo's face
but that did not serve
bo asked to be led to the water where she knelt and with splashing washed out her eyes and then her face and then the bedraggled strands of hair
that mustang didn't break my neck but he rooted my face in the mud
i'll fix him she muttered as she got up
please let me have the towel now well
milt dale you're laughing  excuse me bo
ihaw
haw
haw then dale lurched off holding his sides
bo gazed after him and then back at helen
i suppose if i'd been kicked and smashed and killed you'd laugh she said
and then she melted
oh my pretty ridingsuit
what a mess
i must be a sight nell i rode that wild ponythe sunofagun
i rode him
that's enough for me
you try it
laugh all you want
it was funny
but if you want to square yourself with me help me clean my clothes   late in the night helen heard dale sternly calling pedro
she felt some little alarm
however nothing happened and she soon went to sleep again
at the morning meal dale explained
pedro an' tom were uneasy last night
i think there are lions workin' over the ridge somewhere
i heard one scream  scream inquired bo with interest
yes an' if you ever hear a lion scream you will think it a woman in mortal agony
the cougar cry as roy calls it is the wildest to be heard in the woods
a wolf howls
he is sad hungry and wild
but a cougar seems human an' dyin' an' wild
we'll saddle up an' ride over there
maybe pedro will tree a lion
bo if he does will you shoot it  sure replied bo with her mouth full of biscuit
that was how they came to take a long slow steep ride under cover of dense spruce
helen liked the ride after they got on the heights
but they did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure of gazing afar over the ranges
dale led up and down and finally mostly down until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with parks lying below and streams shining in the sun
more than once pedro had to be harshly called by dale
the hound scented game
here's an old kill said dale halting to point at some bleached bones scattered under a spruce
tufts of grayishwhite hair lay strewn around
what was it asked bo
deer of course
killed there an' eaten by a lion
sometime last fall
see even the skull is split
but i could not say that the lion did it  helen shuddered
she thought of the tame deer down at dale's camp
how beautiful and graceful and responsive to kindness
they rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of some green bushes bordering it
here pedro barked the first time helen had heard him
the hair on his neck bristled and it required stern calls from dale to hold him in
dale dismounted
hyar pede you get back he ordered
i'll let you go presently
girls you're goin' to see somethin'
but stay on your horses  dale with the hound tense and bristling beside him strode here and there at the edge of the swale
presently he halted on a slight elevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over
here see where the grass is pressed down all nice an' round he said pointing
a lion made that
he sneaked there watchin' for deer
that was done this mornin'
come on now
let's see if we can trail him  dale stooped now studying the grass and holding pedro
suddenly he straightened up with a flash in his gray eyes
here's where he jumped  but helen could not see any reason why dale should say that
the man of the forest took a long stride then another
an' here's where that lion lit on the back of the deer
it was a big jump
see the sharp hoof tracks of the deer dale pressed aside tall grass to show dark rough fresh tracks of a deer evidently made by violent action
come on called dale walking swiftly
you're sure goin' to see somethin' now
here's where the deer bounded carryin' the lion  what exclaimed bo incredulously
the deer was runnin' here with the lion on his back
i'll prove it to you
come on now
pedro you stay with me
girls it's a fresh trail  dale walked along leading his horse and occasionally he pointed down into the grass
there
see that
that's hair  helen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground and she believed she saw little dark separations in the grass where an animal had recently passed
all at once dale halted
when helen reached him bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide flattened space in the grass
even helen's inexperienced eyes could make out evidences of a struggle
tufts of graywhite hair lay upon the crushed grass
helen did not need to see any more but dale silently pointed to a patch of blood
then he spoke  the lion brought the deer down here an' killed him
probably broke his neck
that deer ran a hundred yards with the lion
see here's the trail left where the lion dragged the deer off  a welldefined path showed across the swale
girls you'll see that deer pretty quick declared dale starting forward
this work has just been done
only a few minutes ago  how can you tell queried bo
look
see that grass
it has been bent down by the deer bein' dragged over it
now it's springin' up  dale's next stop was on the other side of the swale under a spruce with low spreading branches
the look of pedro quickened helen's pulse
he was wild to give chase
fearfully helen looked where dale pointed expecting to see the lion
but she saw instead a deer lying prostrate with tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair
girls that lion heard us an' left
he's not far said dale as he stooped to lift the head of the deer
warm
neck broken
see the lion's teeth an' claw marks
it's a doe
look here
don't be squeamish girls
this is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest
see where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as i could do it an' he'd just begun to bite in there when he heard us  what murderous work the sight sickens me exclaimed helen
it is nature said dale simply
let's kill the lion added bo
for answer dale took a quick turn at their saddlegirths and then mounting he called to the hound
hunt him up pedro  like a shot the hound was off
ride in my tracks an' keep close to me called dale as he wheeled his horse
we're off squealed bo in wild delight and she made her mount plunge
helen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the swale to the woods
pedro was running straight with his nose high
he let out one short bark
he headed into the woods with dale not far behind
helen was on one of dale's best horses but that fact scarcely manifested itself because the others began to increase their lead
they entered the woods
it was open and fairly good going
bo's horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open
that frightened helen and she yelled to bo to hold him in
she yelled to deaf ears
that was bo's great riskshe did not intend to be careful
suddenly the forest rang with dale's encouraging yell meant to aid the girls in following him
helen's horse caught the spirit of the chase
he gained somewhat on bo hurdling logs sometimes two at once
helen's blood leaped with a strange excitement utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless
yet her natural fear and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish risk of this ride shared alike in her sum of sensations
she tried to remember dale's caution about dodging branches and snags and sliding her knees back to avoid knocks from trees
she barely missed some frightful reaching branches
she received a hard knock then another that unseated her but frantically she held on and slid back and at the end of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging blow in the face from a farspreading branch of pine
bo missed by what seemed only an inch a solid snag that would have broken her in two
both pedro and dale got out of helen's sight
then helen as she began to lose bo felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left behind to get lost in the forest and she urged her horse
dale's yell pealed back
then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than by sight
wind and brush tore at her
the air was heavily pungent with odor of pine
helen heard a wild full bay of the hound ringing back full of savage eagerness and she believed pedro had roused out the lion from some covert
it lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her horse on faster
then the swift pace slackened
a windfall of timber delayed helen
she caught a glimpse of dale far ahead climbing a slope
the forest seemed full of his ringing yell
helen strangely wished for level ground and the former swift motion
next she saw bo working down to the right and dale's yell now came from that direction
helen followed got out of the timber and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park
when she reached the open she saw bo almost across this narrow open ground
here helen did not need to urge her mount
he snorted and plunged at the level and he got to going so fast that helen would have screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been breathless
her horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground
he went to his knees and helen sailed out of the saddle over his head
soft willows and wet grass broke her fall
she was surprised to find herself unhurt
up she bounded and certainly did not know this new helen rayner
her horse was coming and he had patience with her but he wanted to hurry
helen made the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it
she would tell bo that
but just then bo flashed into the woods out of sight
helen fairly charged into that green foliage breaking brush and branches
she broke through into open forest
bo was inside riding down an aisle between pines and spruces
at that juncture helen heard dale's melodious yell near at hand
coming into still more open forest with rocks here and there she saw dale dismounted under a pine and pedro standing with fore paws upon the treetrunk and then high up on a branch a huge tawny colored lion just like tom
bo's horse slowed up and showed fear but he kept on as far as dale's horse
but helen's refused to go any nearer
she had difficulty in halting him
presently she dismounted and throwing her bridle over a stump she ran on panting and fearful yet tingling all over up to her sister and dale
nell you did pretty good for a tenderfoot was bo's greeting
it was a fine chase said dale
you both rode well
i wish you could have seen the lion on the ground
he boundedgreat long bounds with his tail up in the airvery funny
an' pedro almost caught up with him
that scared me because he would have killed the hound
pedro was close to him when he treed
an' there he isthe yellow deerkiller
he's a male an' full grown  with that dale pulled his rifle from its saddlesheath and looked expectantly at bo
but she was gazing with great interest and admiration up at the lion
isn't he just beautiful she burst out
oh look at him spit
just like a cat
dale he looks afraid he might fall off  he sure does
lions are never sure of their balance in a tree
but i never saw one make a misstep
he knows he doesn't belong there  to helen the lion looked splendid perched up there
he was long and round and graceful and tawny
his tongue hung out and his plump sides heaved showing what a quick hard run he had been driven to
what struck helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he looked down at the hound
he was scared
he realized his peril
it was not possible for helen to watch him killed yet she could not bring herself to beg bo not to shoot
helen confessed she was a tenderfoot
get down bo an' let's see how good a shot you are said dale
bo slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a rueful smile at dale
i've changed my mind
i said i would kill him but now i can't
he looks soso different from what i'd imagined  dale's answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed helen's heart toward him
all the same he was amused
sheathing the gun he mounted his horse
come on pedro he called
come i tell you he added sharply well girls we treed him anyhow an' it was fun
now we'll ride back to the deer he killed an' pack a haunch to camp for our own use  will the lion go back to hishis kill i think you called it asked bo
i've chased one away from his kill half a dozen times
lions are not plentiful here an' they don't get overfed
i reckon the balance is pretty even  this last remark made helen inquisitive
and as they slowly rode on the backtrail dale talked
you girls bein' tenderhearted an' not knowin' the life of the forest what's good an' what's bad think it was a pity the poor deer was killed by a murderous lion
but you're wrong
as i told you the lion is absolutely necessary to the health an' joy of wild lifeor deer's wild life so to speak
when deer were created or came into existence then the lion must have come too
they can't live without each other
wolves now are not particularly deerkillers
they live off elk an' anythin' they can catch
so will lions for that matter
but i mean lions follow the deer to an' fro from winter to summer feedin'grounds
where there's no deer you will find no lions
well now if left alone deer would multiply very fast
in a few years there would be hundreds where now there's only one
an' in time as the generations passed they'd lose the fear the alertness the speed an' strength the eternal vigilance that is love of lifethey'd lose that an' begin to deteriorate an' disease would carry them off
i saw one season of blacktongue among deer
it killed them off an' i believe that is one of the diseases of overproduction
the lions now are forever on the trail of the deer
they have learned
wariness is an instinct born in the fawn
it makes him keen quick active fearful an' so he grows up strong an' healthy to become the smooth sleek beautiful softeyed an' wildlookin' deer you girls love to watch
but if it wasn't for the lions the deer would not thrive
only the strongest an' swiftest survive
that is the meanin' of nature
there is always a perfect balance kept by nature
it may vary in different years but on the whole in the long years it averages an even balance  how wonderfully you put it exclaimed bo with all her impulsiveness
oh i'm glad i didn't kill the lion  what you say somehow hurts me said helen wistfully to the hunter
i seei feel how truehow inevitable it is
but it changes mymy feelings
almost i'd rather not acquire such knowledge as yours
this balance of naturehow tragichow sad  but why asked dale
you love birds an' birds are the greatest killers in the forest  don't tell me thatdon't prove it implored helen
it is not so much the love of life in a deer or any creature and the terrible clinging to life that gives me distress
it is suffering
i can't bear to see pain
i can stand pain myself but i can't bear to see or think of it  well replied
dale thoughtfully there you stump me again
i've lived long in the forest an' when a man's alone he does a heap of thinkin'
an' always i couldn't understand a reason or a meanin' for pain
of all the bafflin' things of life that is the hardest to understand an' to forgivepain   that evening as they sat in restful places round the campfire with the still twilight fading into night dale seriously asked the girls what the day's chase had meant to them
his manner of asking was productive of thought
both girls were silent for a moment
glorious was bo's brief and eloquent reply
why asked
dale curiously
you are a girl
you've been used to home people love comfort safety quiet  maybe that is just why it was glorious said bo earnestly
i can hardly explain
i loved the motion of the horse the feel of wind in my face the smell of the pine the sight of slope and forest glade and windfall and rocks and the black shade under the spruces
my blood beat and burned
my teeth clicked
my nerves all quivered
my heart sometimes at dangerous moments almost choked me and all the time it pounded hard
now my skin was hot and then it was cold
but i think the best of that chase for me was that i was on a fast horse guiding him controlling him
he was alive
oh how i felt his running  well what you say is as natural to me as if i felt it said dale
i wondered
you're certainly full of fire an' helen what do you say  bo has answered you with her feelings replied helen i could not do that and be honest
the fact that bo wouldn't shoot the lion after we treed him acquits her
nevertheless her answer is purely physical
you know mr dale how you talk about the physical
i should say my sister was just a young wild highly sensitive hotblooded female of the species
she exulted in that chase as an indian
her sensations were inherited onescertainly not acquired by education
bo always hated study
the ride was a revelation to me
i had a good many of bo's feelingsthough not so strong
but over against them was the opposition of reason of consciousness
a newborn side of my nature confronted me strange surprising violent irresistible
it was as if another side of my personality suddenly said 'here i am
reckon with me now'
and there was no use for the moment to oppose that strange side
ithe thinking helen rayner was powerless
oh yes i had such thoughts even when the branches were stinging my face and i was thrilling to the bay of the hound
once my horse fell and threw me you needn't look alarmed
it was fine
i went into a soft place and was unhurt
but when i was sailing through the air a thought flashed this is the end of me
it was like a dream when you are falling dreadfully
much of what i felt and thought on that chase must have been because of what i have studied and read and taught
the reality of it the action and flash were splendid
but fear of danger pity for the chased lion consciousness of foolish risk of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility i have takenall these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a sheer physical primitive joy of the wild moment  dale listened intently and after helen had finished he studied the fire and thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick
his face was still and serene untroubled and unlined but to helen his eyes seemed sad pensive expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder
she had carefully and earnestly spoken because she was very curious to hear what he might say
i understand you he replied presently
an' i'm sure surprised that i can
i've read my booksan' reread them but no one ever talked like that to me
what i make of it is this
you've the same blood in you that's in bo
an' blood is stronger than brain
remember that blood is life
it would be good for you to have it run an' beat an' burn as bo's did
your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before intellect was born in your ancestors
instinct may not be greater than reason but it's a million years older
don't fight your instincts so hard
if they were not good the god of creation would not have given them to you
today your mind was full of selfrestraint that did not altogether restrain
you couldn't forget yourself
you couldn't feel only as bo did
you couldn't be true to your real nature  i don't agree with you replied helen quickly
i don't have to be an indian to be true to myself  why yes you do said dale
but i couldn't be an indian declared helen spiritedly
i couldn't feel only as you say bo did
i couldn't go back in the scale as you hint
what would all my education amount tothough goodness knows it's little enoughif i had no control over primitive feelings that happened to be born in me  you'll have little or no control over them when the right time comes  replied dale
your sheltered life an' education have led you away from natural instincts
but they're in you an' you'll learn the proof of that out here  no
not if i lived a hundred years in the west asserted helen
but child do you know what you're talkin' about  here bo let out a blissful peal of laughter
mr
dale exclaimed helen almost affronted
she was stirred
i know myself at least  but you do not
you've no idea of yourself
you've education yes but not in nature an' life
an' after all they are the real things
answer me nowhonestly will you  certainly if i can
some of your questions are hard to answer  have you ever been starved he asked
no replied helen
have you ever been lost away from home  no  have you ever faced deathreal stark an' naked death close an' terrible  no indeed  have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands  oh mr dale youyou amaze me
no
no  i reckon i know your answer to my last question but i'll ask it anyhow have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could not live without him  bo fell off her seat with a high trilling laugh
oh you two are great  thank heaven i haven't been replied helen shortly
then you don't know anythin' about life declared dale with finality
helen was not to be put down by that dubious and troubled as it made her
have you experienced all those things she queried stubbornly
all but the last one
love never came my way
how could it
i live alone
i seldom go to the villages where there are girls
no girl would ever care for me
i have nothin'
but all the same i understand love a little just by comparison with strong feelin's i've lived  helen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity
his sad and penetrating gaze was on the fire as if in its white heart to read the secret denied him
he had said that no girl would ever love him
she imagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than of the forest
to come back to myself said helen wanting to continue the argument
you declared i didn't know myself
that i would have no selfcontrol
i will  i meant the big things of life he said patiently
what things  i told you
by askin' what had never happened to you i learned what will happen  those experiences to come to me breathed helen incredulously
never  sister nell they sure willparticularly the lastnamed onethe mad love chimed in bo mischievously yet believingly
neither dale nor helen appeared to hear her interruption
let me put it simpler began dale evidently racking his brain for analogy
his perplexity appeared painful to him because he had a great faith a great conviction that he could not make clear
here i am the natural physical man livin' in the wilds
an' here you come the complex intellectual woman
remember for my argument's sake that you're here
an' suppose circumstances forced you to stay here
you'd fight the elements with me an' work with me to sustain life
there must be a great change in either you or me accordin' to the other's influence
an' can't you see that change must come in you not because of anythin' superior in mei'm really inferior to youbut because of our environment
you'd lose your complexity
an' in years to come you'd be a natural physical woman because you'd live through an' by the physical  oh dear will not education be of help to the western woman queried helen almost in despair
sure it will answered dale promptly
what the west needs is women who can raise an' teach children
but you don't understand me
you don't get under your skin
i reckon i can't make you see my argument as i feel it
you take my word for this though
sooner or later you will wake up an' forget yourself
remember  nell i'll bet you do too said bo seriously for her
it may seem strange to you but i understand dale
i feel what he means
it's a sort of shock
nell we're not what we seem
we're not what we fondly imagine we are
we've lived too long with peopletoo far away from the earth
you know the bible says something like this 'dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return'
where do we come from    chapter xii  days passed
every morning helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this day would bring forth especially with regard to possible news from her uncle
it must come sometime and she was anxious for it
something about this simple wild camp life had begun to grip her
she found herself shirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought west
they needed it but she had begun to see how superficial they really were
on the other hand campfire tasks had come to be a pleasure
she had learned a great deal more about them than had bo
worry and dread were always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughtsalways vaguely present though seldom annoying
they were like shadows in dreams
she wanted to get to her uncle's ranch to take up the duties of her new life
but she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild experience
she must get away from that in order to see it clearly and she began to have doubts of herself
meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on
bo leaned more and more toward utter reconciliation to it
her eyes had a wonderful flash like blue lightning her cheeks were gold and brown her hands tanned dark as an indian's
she could vault upon the gray mustang or for that matter clear over his back
she learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win dale's praise and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or upon snake anson
bo if you met that grizzly dale said has been prowling round camp lately you'd run right up a tree declared helen one morning when bo seemed particularly boastful
don't fool yourself retorted bo
but i've seen you run from a mouse  sister couldn't i be afraid of a mouse and not a bear  i don't see how  well bears lions outlaws and other wild beasts are to be met with here in the west and my mind's made up said bo in slownodding deliberation
they argued as they had always argued helen for reason and common sense and restraint bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better to get in the first blow
the morning on which this argument took place dale was a long time in catching the horses
when he did come in he shook his head seriously
some varmint's been chasin' the horses he said as he reached for his saddle
did you hear them snortin' an' runnin' last night  neither of the girls had been awakened
i missed one of the colts went on dale an' i'm goin' to ride across the park  dale's movements were quick and stern
it was significant that he chose his heavier rifle and mounting with a sharp call to pedro he rode off without another word to the girls
bo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang
you won't follow him asked helen quickly
i sure will replied bo
he didn't forbid it  but he certainly did not want us  he might not want you but i'll bet he wouldn't object to me whatever's up said bo shortly
oh
so you think exclaimed helen keenly hurt
she bit her tongue to keep back a hot reply
and it was certain that a bursting gush of anger flooded over her
was she then such a coward
did dale think this slip of a sister so wild and wilful was a stronger woman than she
a moment's silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and no doubt he was right
then the anger centered upon herself and helen neither understood nor trusted herself
the outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse
helen began to saddle her horse
she had the task half accomplished when bo's call made her look up
listen  helen heard a ringing wild bay of the hound
that's pedro she said with a thrill
sure
he's running
we never heard him bay like that before  where's dale  he rode out of sight across there replied bo pointing
and pedro's running toward us along that slope
he must be a miletwo miles from dale  but dale will follow  sure
but he'd need wings to get near that hound now
pedro couldn't have gone across there with him just listen  the wild note of the hound manifestly stirred bo to irrepressible action
snatching up dale's lighter rifle she shoved it into her saddlesheath and leaping on the mustang she ran him over brush and brook straight down the park toward the place pedro was climbing
for an instant helen stood amazed beyond speech
when bo sailed over a big log like a steeplechaser then helen answered to further unconsidered impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened
without coat or hat she mounted
the nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the saddle
a strange trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins
she wanted to scream for bo to wait
bo was out of sight but the deep muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded helen an easy trail to follow
in fact her horse needed no guiding
he ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still
bo was looking up and listening
there he is cried bo as the hound bayed ringingly closer to them this time and she spurred away
helen's horse followed without urging
he was excited
his ears were up
something was in the wind
helen had never ridden along this broken end of the park and bo was not easy to keep up with
she led across bogs brooks swales rocky little ridges through stretches of timber and groves of aspen so thick helen could scarcely squeeze through
then bo came out into a large open offshoot of the park right under the mountain slope and here she sat her horse watching and listening
helen rode up to her imagining once that she had heard the hound
look
look bo's scream made her mustang stand almost straight up
helen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering across an opening on the slope
it's a grizzly
he'll kill pedro
oh where is dale cried bo with intense excitement
bo
that bear is running down
wewe must getout of his road  panted helen in breathless alarm
dale hasn't had time to be close oh i wish he'd come
i don't know what to do  ride back
at least wait for him  just then pedro spoke differently in savage barks and following that came a loud growl and crashings in the brush
these sounds appeared to be not far up the slope
nell
do you hear
pedro's fighting the bear burst out bo
her face paled her eyes flashed like blue steel
the bear 'll kill him  oh that would be dreadful replied helen in distress
but what on earth can we do  hello dale called bo at the highest pitch of her piercing voice
no answer came
a heavy crash of brush a rolling of stones another growl from the slope told helen that the hound had brought the bear to bay
nell i'm going up said bo deliberately
nono
are you mad returned helen
the bear will kill pedro  he might kill you  you ride that way and yell for dale rejoined bo
what willyou do gasped helen
i'll shoot at the bearscare him off
if he chases me he can't catch me coming downhill
dale said that  you're crazy cried helen as bo looked up the slope searching for open ground
then she pulled the rifle from its sheath
but bo did not hear or did not care
she spurred the mustang and he wild to run flung grass and dirt from his heels
what helen would have done then she never knew but the fact was that her horse bolted after the mustang
in an instant seemingly bo had disappeared in the gold and green of the forest slope
helen's mount climbed on a run snorting and heaving through aspens brush and timber to come out into a narrow long opening extending lengthwise up the slope
a sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed helen and halted her horse
she saw a shaking of aspens
then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of the woods
it was a bear of enormous size
helen's heart stoppedher tongue clove to the roof of her mouth
the bear turned
his mouth was open red and dripping
he looked shaggy gray
he let out a terrible bawl
helen's every muscle froze stiff
her horse plunged high and sidewise wheeling almost in the air neighing his terror
like a stone she dropped from the saddle
she did not see the horse break into the woods but she heard him
her gaze never left the bear even while she was falling and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her back against a bush
it upheld her
the bear wagged his huge head from side to side
then as the hound barked close at hand he turned to run heavily uphill and out of the opening
the instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for helen
frozen with horror she had been unable to move or feel or think
all at once she was a quivering mass of cold helpless flesh wet with perspiration sick with a shuddering retching internal convulsion her mind liberated from paralyzing shock
the moment was as horrible as that in which the bear had bawled his frightful rage
a stark icy black emotion seemed in possession of her
she could not lift a hand yet all of her body appeared shaking
there was a fluttering a strangling in her throat
the crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before she recovered use of her limbs
then the naked and terrible thing was gone like a nightmare giving way to consciousness
what blessed relief
helen wildly gazed about her
the bear and hound were out of sight and so was her horse
she stood up very dizzy and weak
thought of bo then seemed to revive her to shock different life and feeling throughout all her cold extremities
she listened
she heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope then dale's clear strong call
she answered
it appeared long before he burst out of the woods riding hard and leading her horse
in that time she recovered fully and when he reached her to put a sudden halt upon the fiery ranger she caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse
the feel of the saddle seemed different
dale's piercing gray glance thrilled her strangely
you're white
are you hurt he said
no
i was scared  but he threw you  yes he certainly threw me  what happened  we heard the hound and we rode along the timber
then we saw the beara monsterwhitecoated  i know
it's a grizzly
he killed the coltyour pet
hurry now
what about bo  pedro was fighting the bear
bo said he'd be killed
she rode right up here
my horse followed
i couldn't have stopped him
but we lost bo
right there the bear came out
he roared
my horse threw me and ran off
pedro's barking saved memy life i think
oh
that was awful
then the bear went upthere and you came  bo's followin' the hound ejaculated dale
and lifting his hands to his mouth he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope rang against the cliffs pealed and broke and died away
then he waited listening
from far up the slope came a faint wild cry highpitched and sweet to create strange echoes floating away to die in the ravines
she's after him declared dale grimly
bo's got your rifle said helen
oh we must hurry  you go back ordered dale wheeling his horse
no helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet
dale spurred ranger and took to the open slope
helen kept at his heels until timber was reached
here a steep trail led up
dale dismounted
horse tracksbear tracksdog tracks he said bending over
we'll have to walk up here
it'll save our horses an' maybe time too  is bo riding up there asked helen eying the steep ascent
she sure is with that dale started up leading his horse
helen followed
it was rough and hard work
she was lightly clad yet soon she was hot laboring and her heart began to hurt
when dale halted to rest helen was just ready to drop
the baying of the hound though infrequent inspirited her
but presently that sound was lost
dale said bear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained he would hear them again
look there he said presently pointing to fresh tracks larger than those made by bo's mustang
elk tracks
we've scared a big bull an' he's right ahead of us
look sharp an' you'll see him  helen never climbed so hard and fast before and when they reached the ridgetop she was all tuckered out
it was all she could do to get on her horse
dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the western end which was considerably higher
in places open rocky ground split the green timber
dale pointed toward a promontory
helen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky
he was a light gray over all his hindquarters with shoulders and head black
his ponderous widespread antlers towered over him adding to the wildness of his magnificent poise as he stood there looking down into the valley no doubt listening for the bay of the hound
when he heard dale's horse he gave one bound gracefully and wonderfully carrying his antlers to disappear in the green
again on a bare patch of ground dale pointed down
helen saw big round tracks toeing in a little that gave her a chill
she knew these were grizzly tracks
hard riding was not possible on this ridge crest a fact that gave helen time to catch her breath
at length coming out upon the very summit of the mountain dale heard the hound
helen's eyes feasted afar upon a wild scene of rugged grandeur before she looked down on this western slope at her feet to see bare gradual descent leading down to sparsely wooded bench and on to deepgreen canuon
ride hard now yelled dale
i see bo an' i'll have to ride to catch her  dale spurred down the slope
helen rode in his tracks and though she plunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright she saw him draw away from her
sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a few yards and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the stirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down
she let him choose the way while she gazed ahead at dale and then farther on in the hope of seeing bo
at last she was rewarded
far down the wooded bench she saw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of bo's hair
her heart swelled
dale would soon overhaul bo and come between her and peril
and on the instant though helen was unconscious of it then a remarkable change came over her spirit
fear left her
and a hot exalting incomprehensible something took possession of her
she let the horse run and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope of soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made the wind bite helen's cheeks and roar in her ears
she lost sight of dale
it gave her a strange grim exultance
she bent her eager gaze to find the tracks of his horse and she found them
also she made out the tracks of bo's mustang and the bear and the hound
her horse scenting game perhaps and afraid to be left alone settled into a fleet and powerful stride sailing over logs and brush
that open bench had looked short but it was long and helen rode down the gradual descent at breakneck speed
she would not be left behind
she had awakened to a heedlessness of risk
something burned steadily within her
a grim hard anger of joy
when she saw far down another open gradual descent that dale had passed bo and that bo was riding the little mustang as never before then helen flamed with a madness to catch her to beat her in that wonderful chase to show her and dale what there really was in the depths of helen rayner
her ambition was to be shortlived she divined from the lay of the land ahead but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that would always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance
the open ground was only too short
that thundering pace soon brought helen's horse to the timber
here it took all her strength to check his headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jackpines
helen lost sight of bo and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from getting lost
she had to follow the trail and in some places it was hard to see from horseback
besides her horse was mettlesome thoroughly aroused and he wanted a free rein and his own way
helen tried that only to lose the trail and to get sundry knocks from trees and branches
she could not hear the hound nor dale
the pines were small close together and tough
they were hard to bend
helen hurt her hands scratched her face barked her knees
the horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he liked instead of the way helen guided him and when he plunged between saplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on her
that did not make any difference to helen
once worked into a frenzy her blood stayed at high pressure
she did not argue with herself about a need of desperate hurry
even a blow on the head that nearly blinded her did not in the least retard her
the horse could hardly be held and not at all in the few open places
at last helen reached another slope
coming out upon canuon rim she heard dale's clear call far down and bo's answering peal high and piercing with its note of exultant wildness
helen also heard the bear and the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon
here helen again missed the tracks made by dale and bo
the descent looked impassable
she rode back along the rim then forward
finally she found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs down over little banks
helen's horse balked at these jumps
when she goaded him over them she went forward on his neck
it seemed like riding straight downhill
the mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to helen as the obstacles grew
then once more the bay of the hound and the bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse
he snorted a shrill defiance
he plunged with fore hoofs in the air
he slid and broke a way down the steep soft banks through the thick brush and thick clusters of saplings sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him
he fell over one bank but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he rebounded and gained his feet
the sounds of fight ceased but dale's thrilling call floated up on the pinescented air
before helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope in a narrow canuonbed full of rocks and trees with a soft roar of running water filling her ears
tracks were everywhere and when she came to the first open place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into the water
here he had fought pedro
signs of that battle were easy to read
helen saw where his huge tracks still wet led up the opposite sandy bank
then downstream helen did some more reckless and splendid riding
on level ground the horse was great
once he leaped clear across the brook
every plunge every turn helen expected to come upon dale and bo facing the bear
the canuon narrowed the streambed deepened
she had to slow down to get through the trees and rocks
quite unexpectedly she rode pellmell upon dale and bo and the panting pedro
her horse plunged to a halt answering the shrill neighs of the other horses
dale gazed in admiring amazement at helen
say did you meet the bear again he queried blankly
no
didn'tyoukill him panted helen slowly sagging in her saddle
he got away in the rocks
rough country down here  helen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief
she saw that she was bloody dirty disheveled and wringing wet with perspiration
her riding habit was torn into tatters
every muscle seemed to burn and sting and all her bones seemed broken
but it was worth all this to meet dale's penetrating glance to see bo's utter incredulous astonishment
nellrayner gasped bo
ifmy horse 'd beenany goodin the woods panted helen i'd not lostso much timeriding down this mountain
and i'd caught youbeat you  girl did you ride down this last slope queried dale
i sure did replied helen smiling
we walked every step of the way and was lucky to get down at that  responded dale gravely
no horse should have been ridden down there
why he must have slid down  we slidyes
but i stayed on him  bo's incredulity changed to wondering speechless admiration
and dale's rare smile changed his gravity
i'm sorry
it was rash of me
i thought you'd go back
but all's well that ends well helen did you wake up today  she dropped her eyes not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her
maybea little she replied and she covered her face with her hands
remembrance of his questionsof his assurance that she did not know the real meaning of lifeof her stubborn antagonismmade her somehow ashamed
but it was not for long
the chase was great she said
i did not know myself
you were right  in how many ways did you find me right he asked
i think allbut one she replied with a laugh and a shudder
i'm near starved nowi was so furious at bo that i could have choked her
i faced that horrible brute oh i know what it is to fear death
i was lost twice on the rideabsolutely lost
that's all  bo found her tongue
the last thing was for you to fall wildly in love wasn't it  according to dale i must add that to my new experiences of todaybefore i can know real life replied helen demurely
the hunter turned away
let us go he said soberly
chapter xiii  after more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold and purple park and dreamily listening by day to the everlow and everchanging murmur of the waterfall and by night to the wild lonely mourn of a hunting wolf and climbing to the dizzy heights where the wind stung sweetly helen rayner lost track of time and forgot her peril
roy beeman did not return
if occasionally dale mentioned roy and his quest the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the old uncle and then they forgot again
paradise park lived in a little while at that season of the year would have claimed any one and ever afterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams
bo gave up to the wild life to the horses and rides to the many pets and especially to the cougar tom
the big cat followed her everywhere played with her rolling and pawing kittenlike and he would lay his massive head in her lap to purr his content
bo had little fear of anything and here in the wilds she soon lost that
another of dale's pets was a halfgrown black bear named muss
he was abnormally jealous of little bud and he had a welldeveloped hatred of tom otherwise he was a very goodtempered bear and enjoyed dale's impartial regard
tom however chased muss out of camp whenever dale's back was turned and sometimes muss stayed away shifting for himself
with the advent of bo who spent a good deal of time on the animals muss manifestly found the camp more attractive
whereupon dale predicted trouble between tom and muss
bo liked nothing better than a roughandtumble frolic with the black bear
muss was not very big nor very heavy and in a wrestling bout with the strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best
it spoke well of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt bo
he never bit or scratched though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws
whereupon bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in earnest
one afternoon before the early supper they always had dale and helen were watching bo teasing the bear
she was in her most vixenish mood full of life and fight
tom lay his long length on the grass watching with narrow gleaming eyes
when bo and muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and over dale called helen's attention to the cougar
tom's jealous
it's strange how animals are like people
pretty soon i'll have to corral muss or there'll be a fight  helen could not see anything wrong with tom except that he did not look playful
during suppertime both bear and cougar disappeared though this was not remarked until afterward
dale whistled and called but the rival pets did not return
next morning tom was there curled up snugly at the foot of bo's bed and when she arose he followed her around as usual
but muss did not return
the circumstance made dale anxious
he left camp taking tom with him and upon returning stated that he had followed muss's track as far as possible and then had tried to put tom on the trail but the cougar would not or could not follow it
dale said tom never liked a bear trail anyway cougars and bears being common enemies
so whether by accident or design bo lost one of her playmates
the hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one of the mountains
he did not discover any sign of muss but he said he had found something else
bo you girls want some more real excitement he asked
helen smiled her acquiescence and bo replied with one of her forceful speeches
don't mind bein' good an' scared he went on
you can't scare me bantered bo
but helen looked doubtful
up in one of the parks i ran across one of my horsesa lame bay you haven't seen
well he had been killed by that old silvertip
the one we chased
hadn't been dead over an hour
blood was still runnin' an' only a little meat eaten
that bear heard me or saw me an' made off into the woods
but he'll come back tonight
i'm goin' up there lay for him an' kill him this time
reckon you'd better go because i don't want to leave you here alone at night  are you going to take tom asked bo
no
the bear might get his scent
an' besides tom ain't reliable on bears
i'll leave pedro home too  when they had hurried supper and dale had gotten in the horses the sun had set and the valley was shadowing low down while the ramparts were still golden
the long zigzag trail dale followed up the slope took nearly an hour to climb so that when that was surmounted and he led out of the woods twilight had fallen
a rolling park extended as far as helen could see bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling stretches of trees
here and there like islands were isolated patches of timber
at ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night was a rich and rare atmospheric effect
it looked as if it was seen through perfectly clear smoked glass
objects were singularly visible even at long range and seemed magnified
in the west where the afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark ragged sprucespeared horizonline there was such a transparent golden line melting into vivid starfired blue that helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering admiration
dale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls kept up with him
the ground was rough with tufts of grass growing close together yet the horses did not stumble
their action and snorting betrayed excitement
dale led around several clumps of timber up a long grassy swale and then straight westward across an open flat toward where the darkfringed forestline raised itself wild and clear against the cold sky
the horses went swiftly and the wind cut like a blade of ice
helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she had just climbed a laborsome hill
the stars began to blink out of the blue and the gold paled somewhat and yet twilight lingered
it seemed long across that flat but really was short
coming to a thin line of trees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch of woods dale dismounted and tied his horse
when the girls got off he haltered their horses also
stick close to me an' put your feet down easy he whispered
how tall and dark he loomed in the fading light
helen thrilled as she had often of late at the strange potential force of the man
stepping softly without the least sound dale entered this straggly bit of woods which appeared to have narrow byways and nooks
then presently he came to the top of a wellwooded slope dark as pitch apparently
but as helen followed she perceived the trees and they were thin dwarf spruce partly dead
the slope was soft and springy easy to step upon without noise
dale went so cautiously that helen could not hear him and sometimes in the gloom she could not see him
then the chill thrills ran over her
bo kept holding on to helen which fact hampered helen as well as worked somewhat to disprove bo's boast
at last level ground was reached
helen made out a lightgray background crossed by black bars
another glance showed this to be the dark treetrunks against the open park
dale halted and with a touch brought helen to a straining pause
he was listening
it seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as silent and motionless as one of the dark trees
he's not there yet dale whispered and he stepped forward very slowly
helen and bo began to come up against thin dead branches that were invisible and then cracked
then dale knelt down seemed to melt into the ground
you'll have to crawl he whispered
how strange and thrilling that was for helen and hard work
the ground bore twigs and dead branches which had to be carefully crawled over and lying flat as was necessary it took prodigious effort to drag her body inch by inch
like a huge snake dale wormed his way along
gradually the wood lightened
they were nearing the edge of the park
helen now saw a strip of open with a high black wall of spruce beyond
the afterglow flashed or changed like a dimming northern light and then failed
dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two treetrunks at the edge of the wood
come up beside me he whispered
helen crawled on and presently bo was beside her panting with pale face and great staring eyes plain to be seen in the wan light
moon's comin' up
we're just in time
the old grizzly's not there yet but i see coyotes
look  dale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch standing apart some little distance from the black wall
that's the dead horse whispered dale
an' if you watch close you can see the coyotes
they're gray an' they move can't you hear them  helen's excited ears so full of throbs and imaginings presently registered low snaps and snarls
bo gave her arm a squeeze
i hear them
they're fighting
oh gee she panted and drew a long full breath of unutterable excitement
keep quiet now an' watch an' listen said the hunter
slowly the black ragged forestline seemed to grow blacker and lift slowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence slowly the stars paled and the sky filled over
somewhere the moon was rising
and slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer
through the tips of the spruce now seen to be rather close at hand shone a slender silver crescent moon darkening hiding shining again climbing until its exquisite sicklepoint topped the trees and then magically it cleared them radiant and cold
while the eastern black wall shaded still blacker the park blanched and the borderline opposite began to stand out as trees
look
look cried bo very low and fearfully as she pointed
not so loud whispered dale
but i see something  keep quiet he admonished
helen in the direction bo pointed could not see anything but moonblanched bare ground rising close at hand to a little ridge
lie still whispered dale
i'm goin' to crawl around to get a look from another angle
i'll be right back  he moved noiselessly backward and disappeared
with him gone helen felt a palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin
oh my
nell
look whispered bo in fright
i know i saw something  on top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly getting farther out into the light
helen watched with suspended breath
it moved out to be silhouetted against the skyapparently a huge round bristling animal frosty in color
one instant it seemed hugethe next smallthen close at handand far away
it swerved to come directly toward them
suddenly helen realized that the beast was not a dozen yards distant
she was just beginning a new experiencea real and horrifying terror in which her blood curdled her heart gave a tremendous leap and then stood still and she wanted to fly but was rooted to the spotwhen dale returned to her side
that's a pesky porcupine he whispered
almost crawled over you
he sure would have stuck you full of quills  whereupon he threw a stick at the animal
it bounced straight up to turn round with startling quickness and it gave forth a rattling sound then it crawled out of sight
porcupine whispered bo pantingly
it mightas wellhave beenan elephant  helen uttered a long eloquent sigh
she would not have cared to describe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog
listen warned dale very low
his big hand closed over helen's gauntleted one
there you havethe real cry of the wild  sharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf distant yet wonderfully distinct
how wild and mournful and hungry
how marvelously pure
helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its music the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused
again a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life back into the dim remote past from which she had come
the cry was not repeated
the coyotes were still
and silence fell absolutely unbroken
dale nudged helen and then reached over to give bo a tap
he was peering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt
helen looked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the coyotes skulk away out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods where they disappeared
not only dale's intensity but the very silence the wildness of the moment and place seemed fraught with wonderful potency
bo must have felt it too for she was trembling all over and holding tightly to helen and breathing quick and fast
ahuh muttered dale under his breath
helen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation and she divined then something of what the moment must have been to a hunter
then her roving alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow coming out of the forest
it moved but surely that huge thing could not be a bear
it passed out of gloom into silver moonlight
helen's heart bounded
for it was a great frostycoated bear lumbering along toward the dead horse
instinctively helen's hand sought the arm of the hunter
it felt like iron under a rippling surface
the touch eased away the oppression over her lungs the tightness of her throat
what must have been fear left her and only a powerful excitement remained
a sharp expulsion of breath from bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs that she had sighted the grizzly
in the moonlight he looked of immense size and that wild park with the gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him
helen's quick mind so taken up with emotion still had a thought for the wonder and the meaning of that scene
she wanted the bear killed yet that seemed a pity
he had a wagging rolling slow walk which took several moments to reach his quarry
when at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs plainly heard and then a cross growl
evidently he had discovered that his meal had been messed over
as a whole the big bear could be seen distinctly but only in outline and color
the distance was perhaps two hundred yards
then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass
indeed he was dragging it very slowly but surely
look at that whispered dale
if he ain't strong
reckon i'll have to stop him  the grizzly however stopped of his own accord just outside of the shadowline of the forest
then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his prey and began to tear and rend
jess was a mighty good horse muttered dale grimly too good to make a meal for a hog silvertip  then the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position swinging the rifle in front of him
he glanced up into the low branches of the tree overhead
girls there's no tellin' what a grizzly will do
if i yell you climb up in this tree an' do it quick  with that he leveled the rifle resting his left elbow on his knee
the front end of the rifle reaching out of the shade shone silver in the moonlight
man and weapon became still as stone
helen held her breath
but dale relaxed lowering the barrel
can't see the sights very well he whispered shaking his head
remember nowif i yell you climb  again he aimed and slowly grew rigid
helen could not take her fascinated eyes off him
he knelt bareheaded and in the shadow she could make out the gleam of his clearcut profile stern and cold
a streak of fire and a heavy report startled her
then she heard the bullet hit
shifting her glance she saw the bear lurch with convulsive action rearing on his hind legs
loud clicking snaps must have been a clashing of his jaws in rage
but there was no other sound
then again dale's heavy gun boomed
helen heard again that singular spatting thud of striking lead
the bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt a terrific blow
but just as quickly he was up on allfours and began to whirl with hoarse savage bawls of agony and fury
his action quickly carried him out of the moonlight into the shadow where he disappeared
there the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls and crashings in the brush and snapping of branches as he made his way into the forest
sure he's mad said dale rising to his feet
an' i reckon hard hit
but i won't follow him tonight  both the girls got up and helen found she was shaky on her feet and very cold
ohh wasn'titwonwonderful cried bo
are you scared
your teeth are chatterin' queried dale
i'mcold  well it sure is cold all right he responded
now the fun's over you'll feel it nell you're froze too  helen nodded
she was indeed as cold as she had ever been before
but that did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened pulse the cause of which she did not conjecture
let's rustle said dale and led the way out of the wood and skirted its edge around to the slope
there they climbed to the flat and went through the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered
up here the wind began to blow not hard through the forest but still strong and steady out in the open and bitterly cold
dale helped bo to mount and then helen
i'mnumb she said
i'll fall offsure  no
you'll be warm in a jiffy he replied because we'll ride some goin' back
let ranger pick the way an' you hang on  with ranger's first jump helen's blood began to run
out he shot his lean dark head beside dale's horse
the wild park lay clear and bright in the moonlight with strange silvery radiance on the grass
the patches of timber like spired black islands in a moonblanched lake seemed to harbor shadows and places for bears to hide ready to spring out
as helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart beat
half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold
and all seemed gloriousthe sailing moon white in a darkblue sky the white passionless stars so solemn so far away the beckoning fringe of forestland at once mysterious and friendly and the fleet horses running with soft rhythmic thuds over the grass leaping the ditches and the hollows making the bitter wind sting and cut
coming up that park the ride had been long going back was as short as it was thrilling
in helen experiences gathered realization slowly and it was this swift ride the horses neck and neck and all the wildness and beauty that completed the slow insidious work of years
the tears of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full
all that pertained to this night got into her blood
it was only to feel to live now but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward
dale's horse a little in advance sailed over a ditch
ranger made a splendid leap but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell
helen shot over his head
she struck lengthwise her arms stretched and slid hard to a shocking impact that stunned her
bo's scream rang in her ears she felt the wet grass under her face and then the strong hands that lifted her
dale loomed over her bending down to look into her face bo was clutching her with frantic hands
and helen could only gasp
her breast seemed caved in
the need to breathe was torture
nellyou're not hurt
you fell light like a feather
all grass here you can't be hurt said dale sharply
his anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing and his strong hands went swiftly over her arms and shoulders feeling for broken bones
just had the wind knocked out of you went on dale
it feels awful but it's nothin'  helen got a little air that was like hot pinpoints in her lungs and then a deeper breath and then full gasping respiration
i guessi'm not hurtnot a bit she choked out
you sure had a header
never saw a prettier spill
ranger doesn't do that often
i reckon we were travelin' too fast
but it was fun don't you think  it was bo who answered
oh glorious
but gee
i was scared  dale still held helen's hands
she released them while looking up at him
the moment was realization for her of what for days had been a vague sweet uncertainty becoming near and strange disturbing and present
this accident had been a sudden violent end to the wonderful ride
but its effect the knowledge of what had got into her blood would never change
and inseparable from it was this man of the forest
chapter xiv  on the next morning helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a dream of some one shouting
with a start she sat up
the sunshine showed pink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims
bo was on her knees braiding her hair with shaking hands and at the same time trying to peep out
and the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs
that had been dale's voice
nell
nell
wake up called bo wildly
oh some one's come
horses and men  helen got to her knees and peered out over bo's shoulder
dale standing tall and striking beside the campfire was waving his sombrero
away down the open edge of the park came a string of packburros with mounted men behind
in the foremost rider helen recognized roy beeman
that first one's roy she exclaimed
i'd never forget him on a horse bo it must mean uncle al's come  sure
we're born lucky
here we are safe and soundand all this grand camp trip look at the cowboys look
oh maybe this isn't great  babbled bo
dale wheeled to see the girls peeping out
it's time you're up he called
your uncle al is here  for an instant after helen sank back out of dale's sight she sat there perfectly motionless so struck was she by the singular tone of dale's voice
she imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of horsemen meantthey had come to take her to her ranch in pine
helen's heart suddenly began to beat fast but thickly as if muffled within her breast
hurry now girls called dale
bo was already out kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook splashing water in a great hurry
helen's hands trembled so that she could scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair and she was long behind bo in making herself presentable
when helen stepped out a short powerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding bo's hands
wal wal
you favor the rayners he was saying i remember your dad an' a fine feller he was  beside them stood dale and roy and beyond was a group of horses and riders
uncle here comes nell said bo softly
aw the old cattleman breathed hard as he turned
helen hurried
she had not expected to remember this uncle but one look into the brown beaming face with the blue eyes flashing yet sad and she recognized him at the same instant recalling her mother
he held out his arms to receive her
nell auchincloss all over again he exclaimed in deep voice as he kissed her
i'd have knowed you anywhere  uncle al murmured helen
i remember youthough i was only four  wal walthat's fine he replied
i remember you straddled my knee once an' your hair was brighteran' curly
it ain't neither now sixteen years
an' you're twenty now
what a fine broadshouldered girl you are
an' nell you're the handsomest auchincloss i ever seen  helen found herself blushing and withdrew her hands from his as roy stepped forward to pay his respects
he stood bareheaded lean and tall with neither his clear eyes nor his still face nor the proffered hand expressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity of achievement that helen sensed in him
howdy miss helen
howdy bo he said
you all both look fine an' brown
i reckon i was shore slow rustlin' your uncle al up here
but i was figgerin' you'd like milt's camp for a while  we sure did replied bo archly
aw breathed auchincloss heavily
lemme set down  he drew the girls to the rustic seat dale had built for them under the big pine
oh you must be tired
howhow are you asked helen anxiously
tired
wal if i am it's jest this here minit
when joe beeman rode in on me with thet news of youwal i jest fergot i was a wornout old hoss
haven't felt so good in years
mebbe two such young an' pretty nieces will make a new man of me  uncle al you look strong and well to me said bo
and young too and  haw
haw
thet 'll do interrupted al
i see through you
what you'll do to uncle al will be aplenty
yes girls i'm feelin' fine
but strangestrange
mebbe thet's my joy at seein' you safesafe when i feared so thet damned greaser beasley  in helen's grave gaze his face changed swiftlyand all the serried years of toil and battle and privation showed with something that was not age nor resignation yet as tragic as both
wal never mind himnow he added slowly and the warmer light returned to his face
dalecome here  the hunter stepped closer
i reckon i owe you more 'n i can ever pay said auchincloss with an arm around each niece
no al you don't owe me anythin' returned dale thoughtfully as he looked away
ahuh grunted al
you hear him girls now listen you wild hunter
an' you girls listen milt i never thought you much good 'cept for the wilds
but i reckon i'll have to swallow thet
i do
comin' to me as you didan' after bein' druv offkeepin' your council an' savin' my girls from thet holdup wal it's the biggest deal any man ever did for me an' i'm ashamed of my hard feelin's an' here's my hand  thanks al replied dale with his fleeting smile and he met the proffered hand
now will you be makin' camp here  wal no
i'll rest a little an' you can pack the girls' outfitthen we'll go
sure you're goin' with us  i'll call the girls to breakfast replied dale and he moved away without answering auchincloss's query
helen divined that dale did not mean to go down to pine with them and the knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise
had she expected him to go
come here jeff called al to one of his men
a short bowlegged horseman with dusty garb and sunbleached face hobbled forth from the group
he was not young but he had a boyish grin and bright little eyes
awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero
jeff shake hands with my nieces said al
this 's helen an' your boss from now on
an' this 's bo fer short
her name was nancy but when she lay a baby in her cradle i called her bopeep an' the name's stuck
girls this here's my foreman jeff mulvey who's been with me twenty years  the introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals particularly to jeff
jeff throw the packs an' saddles fer a rest was al's order to his foreman
nell reckon you'll have fun bossin' thet outfit chuckled al
none of 'em's got a wife
lot of scalawags they are no women would have them  uncle i hope i'll never have to be their boss replied helen
wal you're goin' to be right off declared al
they ain't a bad lot after all
an' i got a likely new man  with that he turned to bo and after studying her pretty face he asked in apparently severe tone did you send a cowboy named carmichael to ask me for a job  bo looked quite startled
carmichael
why uncle i never heard that name before replied bo bewilderedly
ahuh
reckoned the young rascal was lyin' said auchincloss
but i liked the fellar's looks an' so let him stay  then the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders
las vegas come here he ordered in a loud voice
helen thrilled at sight of a tall superbly built cowboy reluctantly detaching himself from the group
he had a redbronze face young like a boy's
helen recognized it and the flowing red scarf and the swinging gun and the slow spurclinking gait
no other than bo's las vegas cowboy admirer
then helen flashed a look at bo which look gave her a delicious almost irresistible desire to laugh
that young lady also recognized the reluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face
helen recorded her first experience of bo's utter discomfiture
bo turned white then red as a rose
say my niece said she never heard of the name carmichael declared al severely as the cowboy halted before him
helen knew her uncle had the repute of dealing hard with his men but here she was reassured and pleased at the twinkle in his eye
shore boss i can't help thet drawled the cowboy
it's good old texas stock  he did not appear shamefaced now but just as cool easy cleareyed and lazy as the day helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze
texas
you fellars from the pan handle are always hollerin' texas
i never seen thet texans had any one else beatsay from missouri  returned al testily
carmichael maintained a discreet silence and carefully avoided looking at the girls
wal reckon we'll all call you las vegas anyway continued the rancher
didn't you say my niece sent you to me for a job  whereupon carmichael's easy manner vanished
now boss shore my memory's pore he said
i only says  don't tell me thet
my memory's not pore replied al mimicking the drawl
what you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for you  here carmichael stole a timid glance at bo the result of which was to render him utterly crestfallen
not improbably he had taken bo's expression to mean something it did not for helen read it as a mingling of consternation and fright
her eyes were big and blazing a red spot was growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion
well didn't you demanded al
from the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of his employ it seemed to helen that they were having fun at carmichael's expense
yes sir i did suddenly replied the cowboy
ahuh
all right here's my niece
now see thet she speaks the good word  carmichael looked at bo and bo looked at him
their glances were strange wondering and they grew shy
bo dropped hers
the cowboy apparently forgot what had been demanded of him
helen put a hand on the old rancher's arm
uncle what happened was my fault she said
the train stopped at las vegas
this young man saw us at the open window
he must have guessed we were lonely homesick girls getting lost in the west
for he spoke to usnice and friendly
he knew of you
and he asked in what i took for fun if we thought you would give him a job
and i replied just to tease bo that she would surely speak a good word for him  haw
haw
so thet's it replied al and he turned to bo with merry eyes
wal i kept this here las vegas carmichael on his sayso
come on with your good word unless you want to see him lose his job  bo did not grasp her uncle's bantering because she was seriously gazing at the cowboy
but she had grasped something
hehe was the first personout westto speak kindly to us she said facing her uncle
wal thet's a pretty good word but it ain't enough responded al
subdued laughter came from the listening group
carmichael shifted from side to side
hehe looks as if he might ride a horse well ventured bo
best hossman i ever seen agreed al heartily
andand shoot added bo hopefully
bo he packs thet gun low like jim wilson an' all them texas gunfighters
reckon thet ain't no good word  theni'll vouch for him said bo with finality
thet settles it auchincloss turned to the cowboy
las vegas you're a stranger to us
but you're welcome to a place in the outfit an' i hope you won't never disappoint us  auchincloss's tone passing from jest to earnest betrayed to helen the old rancher's need of new and true men and hinted of trying days to come
carmichael stood before bo sombrero in hand rolling it round and round manifestly bursting with words he could not speak
and the girl looked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes
helen saw in the moment more than that little byplay of confusion
missmiss rayneri shoream obliged he stammered presently
you're very welcome she replied softly
ii got on the next train he added
when he said that bo was looking straight at him but she seemed not to have heard
what's your name suddenly she asked
carmichael  i heard that
but didn't uncle call you las vegas  shore
but it wasn't my fault
thet cowpunchin' outfit saddled it on me right off
they don't know no better
shore i jest won't answer to thet handle nowmiss bomy real name is tom  i simply could not call youany name but las vegas replied bo very sweetly
butbeggin' your pardonii don't like thet blustered carmichael
people often get called namesthey don't like she said with deep intent
the cowboy blushed scarlet
helen as well as he got bo's inference to that last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was leaving las vegas
she also sensed something of the disaster in store for mr carmichael
just then the embarrassed young man was saved by dale's call to the girls to come to breakfast
that meal the last for helen in paradise park gave rise to a strange and inexplicable restraint
she had little to say
bo was in the highest spirits teasing the pets joking with her uncle and roy and even poking fun at dale
the hunter seemed somewhat somber
roy was his usual dry genial self
and auchincloss who sat near by was an interested spectator
when tom put in an appearance lounging with his feline grace into the camp as if he knew he was a privileged pet the rancher could scarcely contain himself
dale it's thet damn cougar he ejaculated
sure that's tom  he ought to be corralled or chained
i've no use for cougars  protested al
tom is as tame an' safe as a kitten  ahuh
wal you tell thet to the girls if you like
but not me
i'm an old hoss i am  uncle al tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed said bo
awwhat  honest injun she responded
well isn't it so  helen smilingly nodded her corroboration
then bo called tom to her and made him lie with his head on his stretched paws right beside her and beg for bits to eat
wal
i'd never have believed thet exclaimed al shaking his big head
dale it's one on me
i've had them big cats foller me on the trails through the woods moonlight an' dark
an' i've heard 'em let out thet awful cry
they ain't any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougar's
does this tom ever let out one of them wails  sometimes at night replied dale
wal excuse me
hope you don't fetch the yaller rascal down to pine  i won't  what'll you do with this menagerie  dale regarded the rancher attentively
reckon al i'll take care of them  but you're goin' down to my ranch  what for  al scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter
wal ain't it customary to visit friends  thanks al
next time i ride down pine wayin the spring perhapsi'll run over an' see how you are  spring ejaculated auchincloss
then he shook his head sadly and a faraway look filmed his eyes
reckon you'd call some late  al you'll get well now
these girlsnowthey'll cure you
reckon i never saw you look so good  auchincloss did not press his point farther at that time but after the meal when the other men came to see dale's camp and pets helen's quick ears caught the renewal of the subject
i'm askin' youwill you come auchincloss said low and eagerly
no
i wouldn't fit in down there replied dale
milt talk sense
you can't go on forever huntin' bear an' tamin' cats protested the old rancher
why not asked the hunter thoughtfully
auchincloss stood up and shaking himself as if to ward off his testy temper he put a hand on dale's arm
one reason is you're needed in pine  how
who needs me  i do
i'm playin' out fast
an' beasley's my enemy
the ranch an' all i got will go to nell
thet ranch will have to be run by a man an' held by a man
do you savvy
it's a big job
an' i'm offerin' to make you my foreman right now  al you sort of take my breath replied dale
an' i'm sure grateful
but the fact is even if i could handle the job ii don't believe i'd want to  make yourself want to then
thet 'd soon come
you'd get interested
this country will develop
i seen thet years ago
the government is goin' to chase the apaches out of here
soon homesteaders will be flockin' in
big future dale
you want to get in now
an'  here auchincloss hesitated then spoke lower  an' take your chance with the girl
i'll be on your side  a slight vibrating start ran over dale's stalwart form
alyou're plumb dotty he exclaimed
dotty
me
dotty ejaculated auchincloss
then he swore
in a minit i'll tell you what you are  but al that talk's sosolike an old fool's  huh
an' why so  because thatwonderful girl would never look at me dale replied simply
i seen her lookin' already declared al bluntly
dale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless
never mind thet went on al
mebbe i am a dotty old fool'specially for takin' a shine to you
but i say againwill you come down to pine and be my foreman  no replied dale
milt i've no sonan' i'mafraid of beasley this was uttered in an agitated whisper
al you make me ashamed said dale hoarsely
i can't come
i've no nerve  you've no what  al i don't know what's wrong with me
but i'm afraid i'd find out if i came down there  ahuh
it's the girl  i don't know but i'm afraid so
an' i won't come  aw yes you will  helen rose with beating heart and tingling ears and moved away out of hearing
she had listened too long to what had not been intended for her ears yet she could not be sorry
she walked a few rods along the brook out from under the pines and standing in the open edge of the park she felt the beautiful scene still her agitation
the following moments then were the happiest she had spent in paradise park and the profoundest of her whole life
presently her uncle called her
nell this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss
an' i say you take him  ranger deserves better care than i can give him said dale
he runs free in the woods most of the time
i'd be obliged if she'd have him
an' the hound pedro too  bo swept a saucy glance from dale to her sister
sure she'll have ranger
just offer him to me  dale stood there expectantly holding a blanket in his hand ready to saddle the horse
carmichael walked around ranger with that appraising eye so keen in cowboys
las vegas do you know anything about horses asked bo
me
wal if you ever buy or trade a hoss you shore have me there  replied carmichael
what do you think of ranger went on bo
shore i'd buy him sudden if i could  mr
las vegas you're too late asserted helen as she advanced to lay a hand on the horse
ranger is mine  dale smoothed out the blanket and folding it he threw it over the horse and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place
thank you very much for him said helen softly
you're welcome an' i'm sure glad responded dale and then after a few deft strong pulls at the straps he continued
there he's ready for you  with that he laid an arm over the saddle and faced helen as she stood patting and smoothing ranger
helen strong and calm now in feminine possession of her secret and his as well as her composure looked frankly and steadily at dale
he seemed composed too yet the bronze of his fine face was a trifle pale
but i can't thank youi'll never be able to repay youfor your service to me and my sister said helen
i reckon you needn't try dale returned
an' my service as you call it has been good for me  are you going down to pine with us  no  but you will come soon  not very soon i reckon he replied and averted his gaze
when  hardly before spring  spring
that is a long time
won't you come to see me sooner than that  if i can get down to pine  you're the first friend i've made in the west said helen earnestly
you'll make many morean' i reckon soon forget him you called the man of the forest  i never forget any of my friends
and you've been thethe biggest friend i ever had  i'll be proud to remember  but will you rememberwill you promise to come to pine  i reckon  thank you
all's well then my friend goodby  goodby he said clasping her hand
his glance was clear warm beautiful yet it was sad
auchincloss's hearty voice broke the spell
then helen saw that the others were mounted
bo had ridden up close her face was earnest and happy and grieved all at once as she bade goodby to dale
the packburros were hobbling along toward the green slope
helen was the last to mount but roy was the last to leave the hunter
pedro came reluctantly
it was a merry singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail under the dark spruces
helen assuredly was happy yet a pang abided in her breast
she remembered that halfway up the slope there was a turn in the trail where it came out upon an open bluff
the time seemed long but at last she got there
and she checked ranger so as to have a moment's gaze down into the park
it yawned there a darkgreen and brightgold gulf asleep under a westering sun exquisite wild lonesome
then she saw dale standing in the open space between the pines and the spruces
he waved to her
and she returned the salute
roy caught up with her then and halted his horse
he waved his sombrero to dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes splitting strangely from cliff to cliff
shore milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome said roy as if thinking aloud
but he'll know now  ranger stepped out of his own accord and turning off the ledge entered the spruce forest
helen lost sight of paradise park
for hours then she rode along a shady fragrant trail seeing the beauty of color and wildness hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water but all the while her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had thrilled herthat the hunter this strange man of the forest so deeply versed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion aloof and simple and strong like the elements which had developed him had fallen in love with her and did not know it
chapter xv  dale stood with face and arm upraised and he watched helen ride off the ledge to disappear in the forest
that vast spruce slope seemed to have swallowed her
she was gone
slowly dale lowered his arm with gesture expressive of a strange finality an eloquent despair of which he was unconscious
he turned to the park to his camp and the many duties of a hunter
the park did not seem the same nor his home nor his work
i reckon this feelin's natural he soliloquized resignedly but it's sure queer for me
that's what comes of makin' friends
nell an' bo now they made a difference an' a difference i never knew before  he calculated that this difference had been simply one of responsibility and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship of girls and finally friendship
these would pass now that the causes were removed
before he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come but it was not the one anticipated
always before he had put his mind on his tasks whatever they might be now he worked while his thoughts were strangely involved
the little bear cub whined at his heels the tame deer seemed to regard him with deep questioning eyes the big cougar padded softly here and there as if searching for something
you all miss themnowi reckon said dale
well they're gone an' you'll have to get along with me  some vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him
presently he grew both irritated and surprised with himselfa state of mind totally unfamiliar
several times as old habit brought momentary abstraction he found himself suddenly looking around for helen and bo
and each time the shock grew stronger
they were gone but their presence lingered
after his camp chores were completed he went over to pull down the leanto which the girls had utilized as a tent
the spruce boughs had dried out brown and sear the wind had blown the roof awry the sides were leaning in
as there was now no further use for this little habitation he might better pull it down
dale did not acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many times
therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it
for the first time since roy and he had built the leanto he stepped inside
nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a strange sensation perfectly incomprehensible to him
the blankets lay there on the spruce boughs disarranged and thrown back by hurried hands yet still holding something of round folds where the slender forms had nestled
a black scarf often worn by bo lay covering the pillow of pineneedles a red ribbon that helen had worn on her hair hung from a twig
these articles were all that had been forgotten
dale gazed at them attentively then at the blankets and all around the fragrant little shelter and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable knowledge that he could not destroy the place where helen and bo had spent so many hours
whereupon in studious mood dale took up his rifle and strode out to hunt
his winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in
action suited his mood he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck to slay which seemed murder at last he jumped one that was wild and bounded away
this he shot and set himself a herculean task in packing the whole carcass back to camp
burdened thus he staggered under the trees sweating freely many times laboring for breath aching with toil until at last he had reached camp
there he slid the deer carcass off his shoulders and standing over it he gazed down while his breast labored
it was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen
but neither in stalking it nor making a wonderful shot nor in packing home a weight that would have burdened two men nor in gazing down at his beautiful quarry did dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter
i'm a little off my feed he mused as he wiped sweat from his heated face
maybe a little dotty as i called al
but that'll pass  whatever his state it did not pass
as of old after a long day's hunt he reclined beside the campfire and watched the golden sunset glows change on the ramparts as of old he laid a hand on the soft furry head of the pet cougar as of old he watched the gold change to red and then to dark and twilight fall like a blanket as of old he listened to the dreamy lulling murmur of the water fall
the old familiar beauty wildness silence and loneliness were there but the old content seemed strangely gone
soberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls
he did not distinguish helen from bo in his slow introspection
when he sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep
always after a few moments of wakefulness while the silence settled down or the wind moaned through the pines he had fallen asleep
this night he found different
though he was tired sleep would not soon come
the wilderness the mountains the park the campall seemed to have lost something
even the darkness seemed empty
and when at length dale fell asleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams
up with the keenedged steelybright dawn he went at the his tasks with the springy stride of the deerstalker
at the end of that strenuous day which was singularly full of the old excitement and action and danger and of new observations he was bound to confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him
many times on the heights that day with the wind keen in his face and the vast green billows of spruce below him he had found that he was gazing without seeing halting without object dreaming as he had never dreamed before
once when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and whistling a challenge to invisible rivals stood there a target to stir any hunter's pulse dale did not even raise his rifle
into his ear just then rang helen's voice milt dale you are no indian
giving yourself to a hunter's wildlife is selfish
it is wrong
you love this lonely life but it is not work
work that does not help others is not a real man's work  from that moment conscience tormented him
it was not what he loved but what he ought to do that counted in the sum of good achieved in the world
old al auchincloss had been right
dale was wasting strength and intelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the west
now that he had reached maturity if through his knowledge of nature's law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for existence for place for possession and to hold them in contempt that was no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them from some work that was needed in an incomprehensible world
dale did not hate work but he loved freedom
to be alone to live with nature to feel the elements to labor and dream and idle and climb and sleep unhampered by duty by worry by restriction by the petty interests of menthis had always been his ideal of living
cowboys riders sheepherders farmersthese toiled on from one place and one job to another for the little money doled out to them
nothing beautiful nothing significant had ever existed in that for him
he had worked as a boy at every kind of rangework and of all that humdrum waste of effort he had liked sawing wood best
once he had quit a job of branding cattle because the smell of burning hide the bawl of the terrified calf had sickened him
if men were honest there would be no need to scar cattle
he had never in the least desired to own land and droves of stock and make deals with ranchmen deals advantageous to himself
why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a piece of work to another man's disadvantage
selfpreservation was the first law of life
but as the plants and trees and birds and beasts interpreted that law merciless and inevitable as they were they had neither greed nor dishonesty
they lived by the grand rule of what was best for the greatest number
but dale's philosophy cold and clear and inevitable like nature itself began to be pierced by the human appeal in helen rayner's words
what did she mean
not that he should lose his love of the wilderness but that he realize himself
many chance words of that girl had depth
he was young strong intelligent free from taint of disease or the fever of drink
he could do something for others
who
if that mattered there for instance was poor old mrs cass aged and lame now there was al auchincloss dying in his boots afraid of enemies and wistful for his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors there were the two girls helen and bo new and strange to the west about to be confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests
dale thought of still more people in the little village of pineof others who had failed whose lives were hard who could have been made happier by kindness and assistance
what then was the duty of milt dale to himself
because men preyed on one another and on the weak should he turn his back upon a socalled civilization or should he grow like them
clear as a bell came the answer that his duty was to do neither
and then he saw how the little village of pine as well as the whole world needed men like him
he had gone to nature to the forest to the wilderness for his development and all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of that education
thus dale lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park arrived at a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle
it took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that struggle but at length it evolved into the paradox that helen rayner had opened his eyes to his duty as a man that he accepted it yet found a strange obstacle in the perplexing tumultuous sweet fear of ever going near her again
suddenly then all his thought revolved around the girl and thrown off his balance he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange ideas
when he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest
in his sleep his mind had been active
the idea that greeted him beautiful as the sunrise flashed in memory of auchincloss's significant words take your chance with the girl  the old rancher was in his dotage
he hinted of things beyond the range of possibility
that idea of a chance for dale remained before his consciousness only an instant
stars were unattainable life could not be fathomed the secret of nature did not abide alone on the earththese theories were not any more impossible of proving than that helen rayner might be for him
nevertheless her strange coming into his life had played havoc the extent of which he had only begun to realize
for a month he tramped through the forest
it was october a still golden fulfilling season of the year and everywhere in the vast dark green a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast
he carried his rifle but he never used it
he would climb miles and go this way and that with no object in view
yet his eye and ear had never been keener
hours he would spend on a promontory watching the distance where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out of darkgreen mountain slopes
he loved to fling himself down in an aspengrove at the edge of a senaca and there lie in that radiance like a veil of gold and purple and red with the white treetrunks striping the shade
always whether there were breeze or not the aspenleaves quivered ceaselessly wonderfully like his pulses beyond his control
often he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to listen to watch to feel all that was there while his mind held a haunting darkeyed vision of a girl
on the lonely heights like an eagle he sat gazing down into paradise park that was more and more beautiful but would never again be the same never fill him with content never be all and all to him
late in october the first snow fell
it melted at once on the south side of the park but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed white
dale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply of food and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn during the months he would be snowedin
he watched for the darkgray fastscudding stormclouds and welcomed them when they came
once there lay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowedin until spring
it would be impossible to go down to pine
and perhaps during the long winter he would be cured of this strange nameless disorder of his feelings
november brought storms up on the peaks
flurries of snow fell in the park every day but the sunny south side where dale's camp lay retained its autumnal color and warmth
not till late in winter did the snow creep over this secluded nook
the morning came at last piercingly keen and bright when dale saw that the heights were impassable the realization brought him a poignant regret
he had not guessed how he had wanted to see helen rayner again until it was too late
that opened his eyes
a raging frenzy of action followed in which he only tired himself physically without helping himself spiritually
it was sunset when he faced the west looking up at the pink snowdomes and the darkgolden fringe of spruce and in that moment he found the truth
i love that girl
i love that girl he spoke aloud to the distant white peaks to the winds to the loneliness and silence of his prison to the great pines and to the murmuring stream and to his faithful pets
it was his tragic confession of weakness of amazing truth of hopeless position of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in him
dale's struggle ended there when he faced his soul
to understand himself was to be released from strain worry ceaseless importuning doubt and wonder and fear
but the fever of unrest of uncertainty had been nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love
with somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful and others that he might makehis campfires and meals the care of his pets and horses the mending of saddles and packharness the curing of buckskin for moccasins and huntingsuits
so his days were not idle
but all this work was habit for him and needed no application of mind
and dale like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not retrograde toward the savage was a thinker
love made him a sufferer
the surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender the certain hopelessness of it the long years of communion with all that was wild lonely and beautiful the wonderfully developed insight into nature's secrets and the suddendawning revelation that he was no omniscient being exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of manall these showed him the strength of his manhood and of his passion and that the life he had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and terrible
helen rayner haunted him
in the sunlight there was not a place around camp which did not picture her lithe vigorous body her dark thoughtful eyes her eloquent resolute lips and the smile that was so sweet and strong
at night she was there like a slender specter pacing beside him under the moaning pines
every campfire held in its heart the glowing white radiance of her spirit
nature had taught dale to love solitude and silence but love itself taught him their meaning
solitude had been created for the eagle on his crag for the blasted mountain fir lonely and gnarled on its peak for the elk and the wolf
but it had not been intended for man
and to live always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with selfto think and dreamto be happy which state however pursued by man was not good for him
man must be given imperious longings for the unattainable
it needed then only the memory of an unattainable woman to render solitude passionately desired by a man yet almost unendurable
dale was alone with his secret and every pine everything in that park saw him shaken and undone
in the dark pitchy deadness of night when there was no wind and the cold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall then the silence seemed insupportable
many hours that should have been given to slumber were paced out under the cold white pitiless stars under the lonely pines
dale's memory betrayed him mocked his restraint cheated him of any peace and his imagination sharpened by love created pictures fancies feelings that drove him frantic
he thought of helen rayner's strong shapely brown hand
in a thousand different actions it haunted him
how quick and deft in campfire tasks
how graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair
how tender and skilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured
how eloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on the dangerous heights
how expressive of unutterable things when laid on his arm
dale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm across his shoulder and slide round his neck to clasp there
he was powerless to inhibit the picture
and what he felt then was boundless unutterable
no woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand and heretofore no such imaginings had ever crossed his mind yet deep in him somewhere hidden had been this waiting sweet and imperious need
in the bright day he appeared to ward off such fancies but at night he was helpless
and every fancy left him weaker wilder
when at the culmination of this phase of his passion dale who had never known the touch of a woman's lips suddenly yielded to the illusion of helen rayner's kisses he found himself quite mad filled with rapture and despair loving her as he hated himself
it seemed as if he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life and had forgotten them in this life
he had no right to think of her but he could not resist it
imagining the sweet surrender of her lips was a sacrilege yet here in spite of will and honor and shame he was lost
dale at length was vanquished and he ceased to rail at himself or restrain his fancies
he became a dreamy sadeyed campfire gazer like many another lonely man separated by chance or error from what the heart hungered most for
but this great experience when all its significance had clarified in his mind immeasurably broadened his understanding of the principles of nature applied to life
love had been in him stronger than in most men because of his keen vigorous lonely years in the forest where health of mind and body were intensified and preserved
how simple how natural how inevitable
he might have loved any finespirited healthybodied girl
like a tree shooting its branches and leaves its whole entity toward the sunlight so had he grown toward a woman's love
why
because the thing he revered in nature the spirit the universal the life that was god had created at his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of natureto fight for life to feed himself to reproduce his kind
that was all there was to it
but oh
the mystery the beauty the torment and the terror of this third instinctthis hunger for the sweetness and the glory of a woman's love
chapter xvi  helen rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing out of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncle's ranch
the winter day was bright but steely and the wind that whipped down from the whitecapped mountains had a keen frosty edge
a scant snow lay in protected places cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges low sheets of dust scurried across the flats
the big livingroom of the ranchhouse was warm and comfortable with its red adobe walls its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed and its manycolored blankets
bo rayner sat before the fire curled up in an armchair absorbed in a book
on the floor lay the hound pedro his racy fine head stretched toward the warmth
did uncle call asked helen with a start out of her reverie
i didn't hear him replied bo
helen rose to tiptoe across the floor and softly parting some curtains she looked into the room where her uncle lay
he was asleep
sometimes he called out in his slumbers
for weeks now he had been confined to his bed slowly growing weaker
with a sigh helen returned to her windowseat and took up her work
bo the sun is bright she said
the days are growing longer
i'm so glad  nell you're always wishing time away
for me it passes quickly enough replied the sister
but i love spring and summer and falland i guess i hate winter  returned helen thoughtfully
the yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn swept up to the cold white mountains
helen's gaze seemed to go beyond that snowy barrier
and bo's keen eyes studied her sister's earnest sad face
nell do you ever think of dale she queried suddenly
the question startled helen
a slow blush suffused neck and cheek
of course she replied as if surprised that bo should ask such a thing
ii shouldn't have asked that said bo softly and then bent again over her book
helen gazed tenderly at that bright bowed head
in this swiftflying eventful busy winter during which the management of the ranch had devolved wholly upon helen the little sister had grown away from her
bo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it to the amusement of her uncle to the concern of helen to the dismay and bewilderment of the faithful mexican housekeeper and to the undoing of all the young men on the ranch
helen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which she might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and loving influence
but while she hesitated to speak slow footsteps and a jingle of spurs sounded without and then came a timid knock
bo looked up brightly and ran to open the door
oh
it's onlyyou she uttered in withering scorn to the one who knocked
helen thought she could guess who that was
how are youall asked a drawling voice
well mister carmichael if that interests youi'm quite ill replied bo freezingly
ill
aw no now  it's a fact
if i don't die right off i'll have to be taken back to missouri said bo casually
are you goin' to ask me in queried carmichael bluntly
it's coldan' i've got somethin' to say to  to me
well you're not backward i declare retorted bo
miss rayner i reckon it 'll be strange to youfindin' out i didn't come to see you  indeed
no
but what was strange was the deluded idea i hadthat you meant to apologize to melike a gentleman come in mr carmichael
my sister is here  the door closed as helen turned round
carmichael stood just inside with his sombrero in hand and as he gazed at bo his lean face seemed hard
in the few months since autumn he had changedaged it seemed and the once young frank alert and careless cowboy traits had merged into the making of a man
helen knew just how much of a man he really was
he had been her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had fallen upon her shoulders
wal i reckon you was deluded all rightif you thought i'd crawl like them other lovers of yours he said with cool deliberation
bo turned pale and her eyes fairly blazed yet even in what must have been her fury helen saw amaze and pain
other lovers
i think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter yourself replied bo stingingly
me flatter myself
nope
you don't savvy me
i'm shore hatin' myself these days  small wonder
i certainly hate youwith all my heart  at this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see bo flaunt herself out of the room
but he heard the door close and then slowly came toward helen
cheer up las vegas said helen smiling
bo's hottempered  miss nell i'm just like a dog
the meaner she treats me the more i love her he replied dejectedly
to helen's first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added admiration respect and a growing appreciation of strong faithful developing character
carmichael's face and hands were red and chapped from winter winds the leather of wristbands belt and boots was all worn shiny and thin little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed heavily
he no longer looked the dashing cowboy ready for a dance or lark or fight
how in the world did you offend her so asked helen
bo is furious
i never saw her so angry as that  miss nell it was jest this way began carmichael
shore bo's knowed i was in love with her
i asked her to marry me an' she wouldn't say yes or no an' mean as it soundsshe never run away from it thet's shore
we've had some quarrelstwo of them bad an' this last's the worst  bo told me about one quarrel said helen
it wasbecause you drankthat time  shore it was
she took one of her cold spells an' i jest got drunk  but that was wrong protested helen
i ain't so shore
you see i used to get drunk oftenbefore i come here
an' i've been drunk only once
back at las vegas the outfit would never believe thet
wal i promised bo i wouldn't do it again an' i've kept my word  that is fine of you
but tell me why is she angry now  bo makes up to all the fellars confessed carmichael hanging his head
i took her to the dance last weekover in the townhall
thet's the first time she'd gone anywhere with me
i shore was proud
but thet dance was hell
bo carried on somethin' turrible an' i  tell me
what did she do demanded helen anxiously
i'm responsible for her
i've got to see that she behaves  aw i ain't sayin' she didn't behave like a lady replied carmichael
it wasshewal all them fellars are fools over heran' bo wasn't true to me  my dear boy is bo engaged to you  lordif she only was he sighed
then how can you say she wasn't true to you
be reasonable  i reckon now miss nell thet no one can be in love an' act reasonable rejoined the cowboy
i don't know how to explain but the fact is i feel thet bo has played thethe devil with me an' all the other fellars  you mean she has flirted  i reckon  las vegas i'm afraid you're right said helen with growing apprehension
go on
tell me what's happened  wal thet turner boy who rides for beasley he was hot after bo  returned carmichael and he spoke as if memory hurt him
reckon i've no use for turner
he's a finelookin' strappin' big cowpuncher an' calculated to win the girls
he brags thet he can an' i reckon he's right
wal he was always hangin' round bo
an' he stole one of my dances with bo
i only had three an' he comes up to say this one was his bo very innocentoh she's a cute oneshe says 'why mister turneris it really yours'
an' she looked so full of joy thet when he says to me 'excoose us friend carmichael' i sat there like a locoed jackass an' let them go
but i wasn't mad at thet
he was a better dancer than me an' i wanted her to have a good time
what started the hell was i seen him put his arm round her when it wasn't just time accordin' to the dance an' boshe didn't break any records gettin' away from him
she pushed him awayafter a littleafter i near died
wal on the way home i had to tell her
i shore did
an' she said what i'd love to forget
thenthen miss nell i grabbed herit was outside here by the porch an' all bright moonlighti grabbed her an' hugged an' kissed her good
when i let her go i says sorta brave but i was plumb scaredi says 'wal are you goin' to marry me now
'  he concluded with a gulp and looked at helen with woe in his eyes
oh
what did bo do breathlessly queried helen
she slapped me he replied
an' then she says i did like you best but now i hate you'
an' she slammed the door in my face  i think you made a great mistake said helen gravely
wal if i thought so i'd beg her forgiveness
but i reckon i don't
what's more i feel better than before
i'm only a cowboy an' never was much good till i met her
then i braced
i got to havin' hopes studyin' books an' you know how i've been lookin' into this ranchin' game
i stopped drinkin' an' saved my money
wal she knows all thet
once she said she was proud of me
but it didn't seem to count big with her
an' if it can't count big i don't want it to count at all
i reckon the madder bo is at me the more chance i've got
she knows i love herthet i'd die for herthet i'm a changed man
an' she knows i never before thought of darin' to touch her hand
an' she knows she flirted with turner  she's only a child replied helen
and all this changethe westthe wildnessand you boys making much of herwhy it's turned her head
but bo will come out of it true blue
she is good loving
her heart is gold  i reckon i know an' my faith can't be shook rejoined carmichael simply
but she ought to believe thet she'll make bad blood out here
the west is the west
any kind of girls are scarce
an' one like bolord
we cowboys never seen none to compare with her
she'll make bad blood an' some of it will be spilled  uncle al encourages her said helen apprehensively
it tickles him to hear how the boys are after her
oh she doesn't tell him
but he hears
and i who must stand in mother's place to her what can i do  miss nell are you on my side asked the cowboy wistfully
he was strong and elemental caught in the toils of some power beyond him
yesterday helen might have hesitated at that question
but today carmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty some strange depth of rugged sincerity as if she had learned his future worth
yes i am helen replied earnestly
and she offered her hand
wal then it 'll shore turn out happy he said squeezing her hand
his smile was grateful but there was nothing in it of the victory he hinted at
some of his ruddy color had gone
an' now i want to tell you why i come  he had lowered his voice
is al asleep he whispered
yes replied helen
he was a little while ago  reckon i'd better shut his door  helen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the door then return to her with intent eyes
she sensed events in his look and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her brother
shore i'm the one thet fetches all the bad news to you he said regretfully
helen caught her breath
there had indeed been many little calamities to mar her management of the ranchloss of cattle horses sheepthe desertion of herders to beasleyfailure of freighters to arrive when most neededfights among the cowboysand disagreements over longarranged deals
your uncle al makes a heap of this here jeff mulvey asserted carmichael
yes indeed
uncle absolutely relies on jeff replied helen
wal i hate to tell you miss nell said the cowboy bitterly thet mulvey ain't the man he seems  oh what do you mean  when your uncle dies mulvey is goin' over to beasley an' he's goin' to take all the fellars who'll stick to him  could jeff be so faithlessafter so many years my uncle's foreman
oh how do you know  reckon i guessed long ago
but wasn't shore
miss nell there's a lot in the wind lately as poor old al grows weaker
mulvey has been particular friendly to me an' i've nursed him along 'cept i wouldn't drink
an' his pards have been particular friends with me too more an' more as i loosened up
you see they was shy of me when i first got here
today the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft ground
bud lewis who's bunked with me come out an' tried to win me over to beasleysoon as auchincloss dies
i palavered with bud an' i wanted to know
but bud would only say he was goin' along with jeff an' others of the outfit
i told him i'd reckon over it an' let him know
he thinks i'll come round  whywhy will these men leave me whenwhenoh poor uncle
they bargain on his death
but whytell me why  beasley has worked on themwon them over replied carmichael grimly
after al dies the ranch will go to you
beasley means to have it
he an' al was pards once an' now beasley has most folks here believin' he got the short end of thet deal
he'll have papersshorean' he'll have most of the men
so he'll just put you off an' take possession
thet's all miss nell an' you can rely on its bein' true  ii believe youbut i can't believe suchsuch robbery possible  gasped helen
it's simple as two an' two
possession is law out here
once beasley gets on the ground it's settled
what could you do with no men to fight for your property  but surely some of the men will stay with me  i reckon
but not enough  then i can hire more
the beeman boys
and dale would come to help me  dale would come
an' he'd help a heap
i wish he was here replied carmichael soberly
but there's no way to get him
he's snowedup till may  i dare not confide in uncle said helen with agitation
the shock might kill him
then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old menthat would be cruel oh it can't be so bad as you think  i reckon it couldn't be no worse
an'miss nell there's only one way to get out of itan' thet's the way of the west  how queried helen eagerly
carmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her
he seemed completely detached now from that frank amiable cowboy of her first impressions
the redness was totally gone from his face
something strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes
i seen beasley go in the saloon as i rode past
suppose i go down there pick a quarrel with himan' kill him  helen sat boltupright with a cold shock
carmichael
you're not serious she exclaimed
serious
i shore am
thet's the only way miss nell
an' i reckon it's what al would want
an' between you an' meit would be easier than ropin' a calf
these fellars round pine don't savvy guns
now i come from where guns mean somethin'
an' when i tell you i can throw a gun slick an' fast why i shore ain't braggin'
you needn't worry none about me miss nell  helen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility to mean she feared for his life
but what had sickened her was the mere idea of bloodshed in her behalf
you'dkill beasleyjust because there are rumors of histreachery  gasped helen
shore
it'll have to be done anyhow replied the cowboy
no
no
it's too dreadful to think of
why that would be murder
ii can't understand how you speak of itsoso calmly  reckon i ain't doin' it calmly
i'm as mad as hell said carmichael with a reckless smile
oh if you are serious then i say nonono
i forbid you
i don't believe i'll be robbed of my property  wal supposin' beasley does put you offan' takes possession
what 're you goin' to say then demanded the cowboy in slow cool deliberation
i'd say the same then as now she replied
he bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero
shore you girls haven't been west very long he muttered as if apologizing for them
an' i reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a country  west or no west i won't have fights deliberately picked and men shot even if they do threaten me declared helen positively
all right miss nell shore i respect your wishes he returned
but i'll tell you this
if beasley turns you an' bo out of your homewal i'll look him up on my own account  helen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door and she thrilled and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her his love for bo and that which was inevitable in himself
reckon you might save us all some troublenow if you'djust get madan' let me go after thet greaser  greaser
do you mean beasley  shore
he's a halfbreed
he was born in magdalena where i heard folks say nary one of his parents was no good  that doesn't matter
i'm thinking of humanity of law and order
of what is right  wal miss nell i'll wait till you get real mador till beasley  but my friend i'll not get mad interrupted helen
i'll keep my temper  i'll bet you don't he retorted
mebbe you think you've none of bo in you
but i'll bet you could get so madonce you startedthet you'd be turrible
what 've you got them eyes for miss nell if you ain't an auchincloss  he was smiling yet he meant every word
helen felt the truth as something she feared
las vegas i won't bet
but youyou will always come to mefirstif there's trouble  i promise he replied soberly and then went out
helen found that she was trembling and that there was a commotion in her breast
carmichael had frightened her
no longer did she hold doubt of the gravity of the situation
she had seen beasley often several times close at hand and once she had been forced to meet him
that time had convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her
and on this account coupled with the fact that riggs appeared to have nothing else to do but shadow her she had been slow in developing her intention of organizing and teaching a school for the children of pine
riggs had become rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements
yet his bold apparent badness had made its impression
from all reports he spent his time gambling drinking and bragging
it was no longer news in pine what his intentions were toward helen rayner
twice he had ridden up to the ranchhouse upon one occasion securing an interview with helen
in spite of her contempt and indifference he was actually influencing her life there in pine
and it began to appear that the other man beasley might soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions
the responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden
it could not be managed at least by her in the way auchincloss wanted it done
he was old irritable irrational and hard
almost all the neighbors were set against him and naturally did not take kindly to helen
she had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part of her uncle but he had been a hard driver
then his shrewd farseeing judgment had made all his deals fortunate for him which fact had not brought a profit of friendship
of late since auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating helen had taken many decisions upon herself with gratifying and hopeful results
but the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in the west still held aloof
the memory of paradise park seemed only a dream sweeter and more intangible as time passed and fuller of vague regrets
bo was a comfort but also a very considerable source of anxiety
she might have been a help to helen if she had not assimilated western ways so swiftly
helen wished to decide things in her own way which was as yet quite far from western
so helen had been thrown more and more upon her own resources with the cowboy carmichael the only one who had come forward voluntarily to her aid
for an hour helen sat alone in the room looking out of the window and facing stern reality with a colder graver keener sense of intimacy than ever before
to hold her property and to live her life in this community according to her ideas of honesty justice and law might well be beyond her powers
today she had been convinced that she could not do so without fighting for them and to fight she must have friends
that conviction warmed her toward carmichael and a thoughtful consideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully appreciated him
she would make up for her oversight
there were no mormons in her employ for the good reason that auchincloss would not hire them
but in one of his kindlier hours growing rare now he had admitted that the mormons were the best and the most sober faithful workers on the ranges and that his sole objection to them was just this fact of their superiority
helen decided to hire the four beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come and to do this if possible without letting her uncle know
his temper now as well as his judgment was a hindrance to efficiency
this decision regarding the beemans brought helen back to carmichael's fervent wish for dale and then to her own
soon spring would be at hand with its multiplicity of range tasks
dale had promised to come to pine then and helen knew that promise would be kept
her heart beat a little faster in spite of her businesscentered thoughts
dale was there over the blacksloped snowytipped mountain shut away from the world
helen almost envied him
no wonder he loved loneliness solitude the sweet wild silence and beauty of paradise park
but he was selfish and helen meant to show him that
she needed his help
when she recalled his physical prowess with animals and imagined what it must be in relation to men she actually smiled at the thought of beasley forcing her off her property if dale were there
beasley would only force disaster upon himself
then helen experienced a quick shock
would dale answer to this situation as carmichael had answered
it afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary
the cowboy was one of a bloodletting breed the hunter was a man of thought gentleness humanity
this situation was one of the kind that had made him despise the littleness of men
helen assured herself that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy in all the relations of life which she had observed while with him
but a doubt lingered in her mind
she remembered his calm reference to snake anson and that caused a recurrence of the little shiver carmichael had given her
when the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be able to control dale then she tried not to think of it any more
it confused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought that though it would be dreadful for carmichael to kill beasley for dale to do it would be a calamitya terrible thing
helen did not analyze that strange thought
she was as afraid of it as she was of the stir in her blood when she visualized dale
her meditation was interrupted by bo who entered the room rebelliouseyed and very lofty
her manner changed which apparently owed its cause to the fact that helen was alone
is thatcowboy gone she asked
yes
he left quite some time ago replied helen
i wondered if he made your eyes shineyour color burn so
nell you're just beautiful  is my face burning asked helen with a little laugh
so it is
well bo you've no cause for jealousy
las vegas can't be blamed for my blushes  jealous
me
of that wildeyed softvoiced twofaced cowpuncher
i guess not nell rayner
what 'd he say about me  bo he said a lot replied helen reflectively
i'll tell you presently
first i want to ask youhas carmichael ever told you how he's helped me  no
when i see himwhich hasn't been often latelyheiwell we fight
nell has he helped you  helen smiled in faint amusement
she was going to be sincere but she meant to keep her word to the cowboy
the fact was that reflection had acquainted her with her indebtedness to carmichael
bo you've been so wild to ride halfbroken mustangsand carry on with cowboysand readand sewand keep your secrets that you've had no time for your sister or her troubles  nell burst out bo in amaze and pain
she flew to helen and seized her hands
what 're you saying  it's all true replied helen thrilling and softening
this sweet sister once aroused would be hard to resist
helen imagined she should hold to her tone of reproach and severity
sure it's true cried bo fiercely
but what's my fooling got to do with thethe rest you said
nell are you keeping things from me  my dear i never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles  but i'vei've nursed unclesat up with himjust the same as you  said bo with quivering lips
yes you've been good to him  we've no other troubles have we nell  you haven't but i have responded helen reproachfully
whywhy didn't you tell me cried bo passionately
what are they
tell me now
you must think me aa selfish hateful cat  bo i've had much to worry meand the worst is yet to come replied helen
then she told bo how complicated and bewildering was the management of a big ranchwhen the owner was ill testy defective in memory and hard as steelwhen he had hoards of gold and notes but could not or would not remember his obligationswhen the neighbor ranchers had just claimswhen cowboys and sheepherders were discontented and wrangled among themselveswhen great herds of cattle and flocks of sheep had to be fed in winterwhen supplies had to be continually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly when an enemy rancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of deliberately taking over the property when the owner died
then helen told how she had only that day realized the extent of carmichael's advice and help and laborhow indeed he had been a brother to herhow  but at this juncture bo buried her face in helen's breast and began to cry wildly
iidon't wantto hearany more she sobbed
well you've got to hear it replied helen inexorably i want you to know how he's stood by me  but i hate him  bo i suspect that's not true  i doi do  well you act and talk very strangely then  nell raynerareyouyou sticking up for thatthat devil  i am yes so far as it concerns my conscience rejoined helen earnestly
i never appreciated him as he deservednot until now
he's a man bo every inch of him
i've seen him grow up to that in three months
i'd never have gotten along without him
i think he's fine manly big
i  i'll bethe's made loveto you too replied bo woefully
talk sense said helen sharply
he has been a brother to me
but bo rayner if he had made love to me ii might have appreciated it more than you  bo raised her face flushed in part and also pale with tearwet cheeks and the telltale blaze in the blue eyes
i've been wild about that fellow
but i hate him too she said with flashing spirit
and i want to go on hating him
so don't tell me any more  whereupon helen briefly and graphically related how carmichael had offered to kill beasley as the only way to save her property and how when she refused that he threatened he would do it anyhow
bo fell over with a gasp and clung to helen
ohnell
oh now i love him more thanever she cried in mingled rage and despair
helen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days not so very far back when troubles were not so serious as now
of course you love him she concluded
i guessed that long ago
and i'm glad
but you've been wilfulfoolish
you wouldn't surrender to it
you wanted your fling with the other boys
you'reoh bo i fear you have been a sad little flirt  ii wasn't very bad tilltill he got bossy
why nell he actedright offjust as if he owned me
but he didn't and to show himii really did flirt with that turner fellow
then hehe insulted me oh i hate him  nonsense bo
you can't hate any one while you love him protested helen
much you know about that flashed bo
you just can
look here
did you ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse  yes i have  do you have any idea how strong a cowboy ishow his hands and arms are like iron  yes i'm sure i know that too  and how savage he is  yes  and how he goes at anything he wants to do  i must admit cowboys are abrupt responded helen with a smile
well miss rayner did you everwhen you were standing quiet like a ladydid you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lungegrab you and hold you so you couldn't move or breathe or screamhug you till all your bones crackedand kiss you so fierce and so hard that you wanted to kill him and die  helen had gradually drawn back from this blazingeyed eloquent sister and when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to reply
there
i see you never had that done to you resumed bo with satisfaction
so don't ever talk to me  i've heard his side of the story said helen constrainedly
with a start bo sat up straighter as if better to defend herself
oh
so you have
and i suppose you'll take his parteven about thatthat bearish trick  no
i think that rude and bold
but bo i don't believe he meant to be either rude or bold
from what he confessed to me i gather that he believed he'd lose you outright or win you outright by that violence
it seems girls can't play at love out here in this wild west
he said there would be blood shed over you
i begin to realize what he meant
he's not sorry for what he did
think how strange that is
for he has the instincts of a gentleman
he's kind gentle chivalrous
evidently he had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance
he did that as a last resort
in my opinion his motives were to force you to accept or refuse him and in case you refused him he'd always have those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his selfrespectwhen he thought of turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you
bo i see through carmichael even if i don't make him clear to you
you've got to be honest with yourself
did that act of his win or lose you
in other words do you love him or not  bo hid her face
oh nell
it made me see how i loved himand that made me soso sick i hated him
but nowthe hate is all gone    chapter xvii  when spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over the brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion old al auchincloss had been a month in his grave
to helen it seemed longer
the month had been crowded with work events and growing more hopeful duties so that it contained a world of living
the uncle had not been forgotten but the innumerable restrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest
beasley had not presented himself or any claim upon helen and she gathering confidence day by day began to believe all that purport of trouble had been exaggerated
in this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it
the estate was large
she had no accurate knowledge of how many acres she owned but it was more than two thousand
the fine old rambling ranchhouse set like a fort on the last of the foothills corrals and fields and barns and meadows and the rolling green range beyond and innumerable sheep horses cattleall these belonged to helen to her everwondering realization and evergrowing joy
still she was afraid to let herself go and be perfectly happy
always there was the fear that had been too deep and strong to forget so soon
this bright fresh morning in march helen came out upon the porch to revel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp pinescented wind that swept down from the mountains
there was never a morning that she did not gaze mountainward trying to see with a folly she realized if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge
for all she could see it had not melted an inch and she would not confess why she sighed
the desert had become green and fresh stretching away there far below her range growing dark and purple in the distance with vague buttes rising
the air was full of soundnotes of blackbirds and the baas of sheep and blasts from the corrals and the clatter of light hoofs on the court below
bo was riding in from the stables
helen loved to watch her on one of those fiery little mustangs but the sight was likewise given to rousing apprehensions
this morning bo appeared particularly bent on frightening helen
down the lane carmichael appeared waving his arms and helen at once connected him with bo's manifest desire to fly away from that particular place
since that day a month back when bo had confessed her love for carmichael she and helen had not spoken of it or of the cowboy
the boy and girl were still at odds
but this did not worry helen
bo had changed much for the better especially in that she devoted herself to helen and to her work
helen knew that all would turn out well in the end and so she had been careful of her rather precarious position between these two young firebrands
bo reined in the mustang at the porch steps
she wore a buckskin ridingsuit which she had made herself and its soft gray with the touches of red beads was mightily becoming to her
then she had grown considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to resemble a boy yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe
red spots shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that everdangerous blaze
nell did you give me away to that cowboy she demanded
give you away exclaimed helen blankly
yes
you know i told youawhile backthat i was wildly in love with him
did you give me awaytell on me  she might have been furious but she certainly was not confused
why bo
how could you
no
i did not replied helen
never gave him a hint  not even a hint
you have my word for that
why
what's happened  he makes me sick  bo would not say any more owing to the near approach of the cowboy
mawnin' miss nell he drawled
i was just tellin' this here miss bopeep rayner  don't call me that broke in bo with fire in her voice
wal i was just tellin' her thet she wasn't goin' off on any more of them long rides
honest now miss nell it ain't safe an'  you're not my boss retorted bo
indeed sister i agree with him
you won't obey me  reckon some one's got to be your boss drawled carmichael
shore i ain't hankerin' for the job
you could ride to kingdom come or off among the apachesor over here a waysat this he grinned knowinglyor anywheres for all i cared
but i'm workin' for miss nell an' she's boss
an' if she says you're not to take them ridesyou won't
savvy that miss  it was a treat for helen to see bo look at the cowboy
mister carmichael may i ask how you are going to prevent me from riding where i like  wal if you're goin' worse locoed this way i'll keep you off'n a hoss if i have to rope you an' tie you up
by golly i will  his dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said
wal she drawled it very softly and sweetly but venomously ifyouevertouchme again  at this he flushed then made a quick passionate gesture with his hand expressive of heat and shame
you an' me will never get along he said with a dignity full of pathos
i seen thet a month back when you changed suddenlike to me
but nothin' i say to you has any reckonin' of mine
i'm talkin' for your sister
it's for her sake
an' your own
i never told her an' i never told you thet i've seen riggs sneakin' after you twice on them desert rides
wal i tell you now  the intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on bo
but helen was astonished and alarmed
riggs
oh bo i've seen him myselfriding around
he does not mean well
you must be careful  if i ketch him again went on carmichael with his mouth lining hard i'm goin' after him  he gave her a cool intent piercing look then he dropped his head and turned away to stride back toward the corrals
helen could make little of the manner in which her sister watched the cowboy pass out of sight
a month backwhen i changed suddenlike mused bo
i wonder what he meant by that nell did i changeright after the talk you had with meabout him  indeed you did bo replied helen
but it was for the better
only he can't see it
how proud and sensitive he is
you wouldn't guess it at first
bo your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting
he thinks it's indifference  maybe that 'll be good for him declared bo
does he expect me to fall on his neck
he's that thickheaded
why he's the locoed one not me  i'd like to ask you bo if you've seen how he has changed queried helen earnestly
he's older
he's worried
either his heart is breaking for you or else he fears trouble for us
i fear it's both
how he watches you
bo he knows all you dowhere you go
that about riggs sickens me  if riggs follows me and tries any of his fourflush desperado games he'll have his hands full said bo grimly
and that without my cowboy protector
but i just wish riggs would do something
then we'll see what las vegas tom carmichael cares
then we'll see  bo bit out the last words passionately and jealously then she lifted her bridle to the spirited mustang
nell don't you fear for me she said
i can take care of myself  helen watched her ride away all but willing to confess that there might be truth in what bo said
then helen went about her work which consisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize herself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life
every day brought new problems
she made notes of all that she observed and all that was told her which habit she had found after a few weeks of trial was going to be exceedingly valuable to her
she did not intend always to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men however faithful some of them might be
this morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind owing to the presence of roy beeman and two of his brothers who had arrived yesterday
and she was to discover that jeff mulvey accompanied by six of his coworkers and associates had deserted her without a word or even sending for their pay
carmichael had predicted this
helen had half doubted
it was a relief now to be confronted with facts however disturbing
she had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more trouble than had happened
at the gateway of the main corral a huge inclosure fenced high with peeled logs she met roy beeman lasso in hand the same tall lean limping figure she remembered so well
sight of him gave her an inexplicable thrilla flashing memory of an unforgettable night ride
roy was to have charge of the horses on the ranch of which there were several hundred not counting many lost on range and mountain or the unbranded colts
roy took off his sombrero and greeted her
this mormon had a courtesy for women that spoke well for him
helen wished she had more employees like him
it's jest as las vegas told us it 'd be he said regretfully
mulvey an' his pards lit out this mornin'
i'm sorry miss helen
reckon thet's all because i come over  i heard the news replied helen
you needn't be sorry roy for i'm not
i'm glad
i want to know whom i can trust  las vegas says we're shore in for it now  roy what do you think  i reckon so
still las vegas is powerful cross these days an' always lookin' on the dark side
with us boys now it's sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
but miss helen if beasley forces the deal there will be serious trouble
i've seen thet happen
four or five years ago beasley rode some greasers off their farms an' no one ever knowed if he had a just claim  beasley has no claim on my property
my uncle solemnly swore that on his deathbed
and i find nothing in his books or papers of those years when he employed beasley
in fact beasley was never uncle's partner
the truth is that my uncle took beasley up when he was a poor homeless boy  so my old dad says replied roy
but what's right don't always prevail in these parts  roy you're the keenest man i've met since i came west
tell me what you think will happen  beeman appeared flattered but he hesitated to reply
helen had long been aware of the reticence of these outdoor men
i reckon you mean cause an' effect as milt dale would say responded roy thoughtfully
yes
if beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen  roy looked up and met her gaze
helen remembered that singular stillness intentness of his face
wal if dale an' john get here in time i reckon we can bluff thet beasley outfit  you mean my friendsmy men would confront beasleyrefuse his demandsand if necessary fight him off  i shore do replied roy
but suppose you're not all here
beasley would be smart enough to choose an opportune time
suppose he did put me off and take possession
what then  then it 'd only be a matter of how soon dale or carmichaelor igot to beasley  roy
i feared just that
it haunts me
carmichael asked me to let him go pick a fight with beasley
asked me just as he would ask me about his work
i was shocked
and now you say daleand you  helen choked in her agitation
miss helen what else could you look for
las vegas is in love with miss bo
shore he told me so
an' dale's in love with you
why you couldn't stop them any more 'n you could stop the wind from blowin' down a pine when it got ready now it's some different with me
i'm a mormon an' i'm married
but i'm dale's pard these many years
an' i care a powerful sight for you an' miss bo
so i reckon i'd draw on beasley the first chance i got  helen strove for utterance but it was denied her
roy's simple statement of dale's love had magnified her emotion by completely changing its direction
she forgot what she had felt wretched about
she could not look at roy
miss helen don't feel bad he said kindly
shore you're not to blame
your comin' west hasn't made any difference in beasley's fate except mebbe to hurry it a little
my dad is old an' when he talks it's like history
he looks back on happenin's
wal it's the nature of happenin's that beasley passes away before his prime
them of his breed don't live old in the west
so i reckon you needn't feel bad or worry
you've got friends  helen incoherently thanked him and forgetting her usual round of corrals and stables she hurried back toward the house deeply stirred throbbing and dimeyed with a feeling she could not control
roy beeman had made a statement that had upset her equilibrium
it seemed simple and natural yet momentous and staggering
to hear that dale loved herto hear it spoken frankly earnestly by dale's best friend was strange sweet terrifying
but was it true
her own consciousness had admitted it
yet that was vastly different from a man's open statement
no longer was it a dear dream a secret that seemed hers alone
how she had lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast
something burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the mountains and her sight became clear telescopic with its intensity
magnificently the mountains loomed
black inroads and patches on the slopes showed where a few days back all bad been white
the snow was melting fast
dale would soon be free to ride down to pine
and that was an event helen prayed for yet feared as she had never feared anything
the noonday dinnerbell startled helen from a reverie that was a pleasant aftermath of her unrestraint
how the hours had flown
this morning at least must be credited to indolence
bo was not in the diningroom nor in her own room nor was she in sight from window or door
this absence had occurred before but not particularly to disturb helen
in this instance however she grew worried
her nerves presaged strain
there was an overcharge of sensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very atmosphere
she ate dinner alone looking her apprehension which was not mitigated by the expressive fears of old maria the mexican woman who served her
after dinner she sent word to roy and carmichael that they had better ride out to look for bo
then helen applied herself resolutely to her books until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump up and hurry to the porch
roy was riding in
did you find her queried helen hurriedly
wasn't no track or sign of her up the north range replied roy as he dismounted and threw his bridle
an' i was ridin' back to take up her tracks from the corral an' trail her
but i seen las vegas comin' an' he waved his sombrero
he was comin' up from the south
there he is now  carmichael appeared swinging into the lane
he was mounted on helen's big black ranger and he made the dust fly
wal he's seen her thet's shore vouchsafed roy with relief as carmichael rode up
miss nell she's comin' said the cowboy as he reined in and slid down with his graceful single motion
then in a violent action characteristic of him he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and threw up both arms
i've a hunch it's come off  oh what exclaimed helen
now las vegas talk sense expostulated roy
miss helen is shore nervous today
has anythin' happened  i reckon but i don't know what replied carmichael drawing a long breath
folks i must be gettin' old
for i shore felt orful queer till i seen bo
she was ridin' down the ridge across the valley
ridin' some fast too an' she'll be here right off if she doesn't stop in the village  wal i hear her comin' now said roy
an'if you asked me i'd say she was ridin' some fast  helen heard the light swift rhythmic beat of hoofs and then out on the curve of the road that led down to pine she saw bo's mustang white with lather coming on a dead run
las vegas do you see any apaches asked roy quizzingly
the cowboy made no reply but he strode out from the porch directly in front of the mustang
bo was pulling hard on the bridle and had him slowing down but not controlled
when he reached the house it could easily be seen that bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength which was not enough to halt him
carmichael lunged for the bridle and seizing it hauled him to a standstill
at close sight of bo helen uttered a startled cry
bo was white her sombrero was gone and her hair undone there were blood and dirt on her face and her ridingsuit was torn and muddy
she had evidently sustained a fall
roy gazed at her in admiring consternation but carmichael never looked at her at all
apparently he was examining the horse
well help me offsomebody cried bo peremptorily
her voice was weak but not her spirit
roy sprang to help her off and when she was down it developed that she was lame
oh bo
you've had a tumble exclaimed helen anxiously and she ran to assist roy
they led her up the porch and to the door
there she turned to look at carmichael who was still examining the spent mustang
tell himto come in she whispered
hey there las vegas called roy
rustle hyar will you  when bo had been led into the sittingroom and seated in a chair carmichael entered
his face was a study as slowly he walked up to bo
girl youain't hurt he asked huskily
it's no fault of yours that i'm not crippledor dead or worse  retorted bo
you said the south range was the only safe ride for me
and thereiit happened  she panted a little and her bosom heaved
one of her gauntlets was gone and the bare band that was bruised and bloody trembled as she held it out
dear tell usare you badly hurt queried helen with hurried gentleness
not much
i've had a spill replied bo
but oh
i'm madi'm boiling  she looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries but certainly she had not overestimated her state of mind
any blaze helen had heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one
it actually leaped
bo was more than pretty then
manifestly roy was admiring her looks but carmichael saw beyond her charm
and slowly he was growing pale
i rode out the south rangeas i was told began bo breathing hard and trying to control her feelings
that's the ride you usually take nell and you betif you'd taken it todayyou'd not be here now about three miles out i climbed off the range up that cedar slope
i always keep to high ground
when i got up i saw two horsemen ride out of some broken rocks off to the east
they rode as if to come between me and home
i didn't like that
i circled south
about a mile farther on i spied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came along slow
that i liked still less
it might have been accident but it looked to me as if those riders had some intent
all i could do was head off to the southeast and ride
you bet i did ride
but i got into rough ground where i'd never been before
it was slow going
at last i made the cedars and here i cut loose believing i could circle ahead of those strange riders and come round through pine
i had it wrong  here she hesitated perhaps for breath for she had spoken rapidly or perhaps to get better hold on her subject
not improbably the effect she was creating on her listeners began to be significant
roy sat absorbed perfectly motionless eyes keen as steel his mouth open
carmichael was gazing over bo's head out of the window and it seemed that he must know the rest of her narrative
helen knew that her own wideeyed attention alone would have been allcompelling inspiration to bo rayner
sure i had it wrong resumed bo
pretty soon heard a horse behind
i looked back
i saw a big bay riding down on me
oh but he was running
he just tore through the cedars

i was scared half out of my senses
but i spurred and beat my mustang
then began a race
rough goingthick cedarswashes and gullies i had to make him runto keep my saddleto pick my way
ohhh
but it was glorious
to race for funthat's one thing to race for your life is another
my heart was in my mouthchoking me
i couldn't have yelled
i was as cold as icedizzy sometimesblind othersthen my stomach turnedand i couldn't get my breath
yet the wild thrills i had
but i stuck on and held my own for several milesto the edge of the cedars
there the big horse gained on me
he came pounding closerperhaps as close as a hundred yardsi could hear him plain enough
then i had my spill
oh my mustang trippedthrew me 'way over his head
i hit light but slid farand that's what scraped me so
i know my knee is raw
when i got to my feet the big horse dashed up throwing gravel all over meand his rider jumped off now who do you think he was  helen knew but she did not voice her conviction
carmichael knew positively yet he kept silent
roy was smiling as if the narrative told did not seem so alarming to him
wal the fact of you bein' here safe an' sound sorta makes no difference who thet sonofagun was he said
riggs
harve riggs blazed bo
the instant i recognized him i got over my scare
and so mad i burned all through like fire
i don't know what i said but it was wildand it was a whole lot you bet
you sure can ride' he said
i demanded why he had dared to chase me and he said he had an important message for nell
this was it 'tell your sister that beasley means to put her off an' take the ranch
if she'll marry me i'll block his deal
if she won't marry me i'll go in with beasley'
then he told me to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except nell
well here i amand i seem to have been breathing rather fast  she looked from helen to roy and from roy to las vegas
her smile was for the latter and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile would have told volumes
wal i'll be doggoned ejaculated roy feelingly
helen laughed
indeed the working of that man's mind is beyond me marry him to save my ranch
i wouldn't marry him to save my life  carmichael suddenly broke his silence
bo did you see the other men  yes
i was coming to that she replied
i caught a glimpse of them back in the cedars
the three were together or at least three horsemen were there
they had halted behind some trees
then on the way home i began to think
even in my fury i had received impressions
riggs was surprised when i got up
i'll bet he had not expected me to be who i was
he thought i was nell
i look bigger in this buckskin outfit
my hair was up till i lost my hat and that was when i had the tumble
he took me for nell
another thing i rememberhe made some signsome motion while i was calling him names and i believe that was to keep those other men back
i believe riggs had a plan with those other men to waylay nell and make off with her
i absolutely know it  bo you're sosoyou jump at wild ideas so protested helen trying to believe in her own assurance
but inwardly she was trembling
miss helen that ain't a wild idee said roy seriously
i reckon your sister is pretty close on the trail
las vegas don't you savvy it thet way  carmichael's answer was to stalk out of the room
call him back cried helen apprehensively
hold on boy called roy sharply
helen reached the door simultaneously with roy
the cowboy picked up his sombrero jammed it on his head gave his belt a vicious hitch that made the gunsheath jump and then in one giant step he was astride ranger
carmichael
stay cried helen
the cowboy spurred the black and the stones rang under ironshod hoofs
bo
call him back
please call him back importuned helen in distress
i won't declared bo rayner
her face shone whiter now and her eyes were like fiery flint
that was her answer to a loving gentlehearted sister that was her answer to the call of the west
no use said roy quietly
an' i reckon i'd better trail him up  he too strode out and mounting his horse galloped swiftly away
it turned out that bo was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she had imagined
one knee was rather badly cut which injury alone would have kept her from riding again very soon
helen who was somewhat skilled at bandaging wounds worried a great deal over these sundry blotches on bo's fair skin and it took considerable time to wash and dress them
long after this was done and during the early supper and afterward bo's excitement remained unabated
the whiteness stayed on her face and the blaze in her eyes
helen ordered and begged her to go to bed for the fact was bo could not stand up and her hands shook
go to bed
not much she said
i want to know what he does to riggs  it was that possibility which had helen in dreadful suspense
if carmichael killed riggs it seemed to helen that the bottom would drop out of this structure of western life she had begun to build so earnestly and fearfully
she did not believe that he would do so
but the uncertainty was torturing
dear bo appealed helen you don't wantoh
you do want carmichael toto kill riggs  no i don't but i wouldn't care if he did replied bo bluntly
do you thinkhe will  nell if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before he left declared bo
and he knew what i thought he'd do  and what'sthat faltered helen
i want him to round riggs up down in the villagesomewhere in a crowd
i want riggs shown up as the coward braggart fourflush that he is
and insulted slapped kickeddriven out of pine  her passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came footsteps on the porch
helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and open it just as a tap sounded on the doorpost
roy's face stood white out of the darkness
his eyes were bright
and his smile made helen's fearful query needless
how are youall this evenin' he drawled as he came in
a fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table
by their light bo looked white and eagereyed as she reclined in the big armchair
what 'd he do she asked with all her amazing force
wal now ain't you goin' to tell me how you are  roy i'm all bunged up
i ought to be in bed but i just couldn't sleep till i hear what las vegas did
i'd forgive anything except him getting drunk  wal i shore can ease your mind on thet replied roy
he never drank a drop  roy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have guessed he was eager to tell
for once the hard intent quietness the soul of labor pain and endurance so plain in his face was softened by pleasurable emotion
he poked at the burning logs with the toe of his boot
helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no spurs
then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down in pine
where is he asked bo
who
riggs
wal i don't know
but i reckon he's somewhere out in the woods nursin' himself  not riggs
first tell me where he is  shore then you must mean las vegas
i just left him down at the cabin
he was gettin' ready for bed early as it is
all tired out he was an' thet white you wouldn't have knowed him
but he looked happy at thet an' the last words he said more to himself than to me i reckon was 'i'm some locoed gent but if she doesn't call me tom now she's no good
'  bo actually clapped her hands notwithstanding that one of them was bandaged
call him tom
i should smile i will she declared in delight
hurry nowwhat 'd  it's shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle las vegas went on roy imperturbably
roy tell me what he didwhat tom didor i'll scream cried bo
miss helen did you ever see the likes of thet girl asked roy appealing to helen
no roy i never did agreed helen
but pleaseplease tell us what has happened  roy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight almost fiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep within him
whatever had happened to riggs had not been too much for roy beeman
helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real westerner hated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado the makebelieve gunman who pretended to sail under the true wild and reckoning colors of the west
roy leaned his lithe tall form against the stone mantelpiece and faced the girls
when i rode out after las vegas i seen him 'way down the road began roy rapidly
an' i seen another man ridin' down into pine from the other side
thet was riggs only i didn't know it then
las vegas rode up to the store where some fellars was hangin' round an' he spoke to them
when i come up they was all headin' for turner's saloon
i seen a dozen hosses hitched to the rails
las vegas rode on
but i got off at turner's an' went in with the bunch
whatever it was las vegas said to them fellars shore they didn't give him away
pretty soon more men strolled into turner's an' there got to be 'most twenty altogether i reckon
jeff mulvey was there with his pards
they had been drinkin' sorta free
an' i didn't like the way mulvey watched me
so i went out an' into the store but kept alookin' for las vegas
he wasn't in sight
but i seen riggs ridin' up
now turner's is where riggs hangs out an' does his braggin'
he looked powerful deep an' thoughtful dismounted slow without seein' the unusual number of hosses there an' then he slouches into turner's
no more 'n a minute after las vegas rode down there like a streak
an' just as quick he was off an' through thet door  roy paused as if to gain force or to choose his words
his tale now appeared all directed to bo who gazed at him spellbound a fascinated listener
before i got to turner's dooran' thet was only a little waysi heard las vegas yell
did you ever hear him
wal he's got the wildest yell of any cowpuncher i ever beard
quicklike i opened the door an' slipped in
there was riggs an' las vegas alone in the center of the big saloon with the crowd edgin' to the walls an' slidin' back of the bar
riggs was whiter 'n a dead man
i didn't hear an' i don't know what las vegas yelled at him
but riggs knew an' so did the gang
all of a sudden every man there shore seen in las vegas what riggs had always bragged he was
thet time comes to every man like riggs
'what 'd you call me'
he asked his jaw shakin'
'i 'ain't called you yet' answered las vegas
'i just whooped'
'what d'ye want'
'you scared my girl'
'the hell ye say
who's she'
blustered riggs an' he began to take quick looks 'round
but he never moved a hand
there was somethin' tight about the way he stood
las vegas had both arms half out stretched as if he meant to leap
but he wasn't
i never seen las vegas do thet but when i seen him then i understood it
'you know
an' you threatened her an' her sister
go for your gun' called las vegas low an' sharp
thet put the crowd right an' nobody moved
riggs turned green then
i almost felt sorry for him
he began to shake so he'd dropped a gun if he had pulled one
'hyar you're offsome mistakei 'ain't seen no gurlsi'  'shut up an' draw'
yelled las vegas
his voice just pierced holes in the roof an' it might have been a bullet from the way riggs collapsed
every man seen in a second more thet riggs wouldn't an' couldn't draw
he was afraid for his life
he was not what he had claimed to be
i don't know if he had any friends there
but in the west good men an' bad men all alike have no use for riggs's kind
an' thet stony quiet broke with hawhaw
it shore was as pitiful to see riggs as it was fine to see las vegas
when he dropped his arms then i knowed there would be no gunplay
an' then las vegas got red in the face
he slapped riggs with one hand then with the other
an' he began to cuss him
i shore never knowed thet nicespoken las vegas carmichael could use such language
it was a stream of the baddest names known out here an' lots i never heard of
now an' then i caught somethin' like lowdown an' sneak an' fourflush an' longhaired skunk but for the most part they was just the cussedest kind of names
an' las vegas spouted them till he was black in the face an' foamin' at the mouth an' hoarser 'n a bawlin' cow
when he got out of breath from cussin' he punched riggs all about the saloon threw him outdoors knocked him down an' kicked him till he got kickin' him down the road with the whole hawhawed gang behind
an' he drove him out of town    chapter xviii  for two days bo was confined to her bed suffering considerable pain and subject to fever during which she talked irrationally
some of this talk afforded helen as vast an amusement as she was certain it would have lifted tom carmichael to a seventh heaven
the third day however bo was better and refusing to remain in bed she hobbled to the sittingroom where she divided her time between staring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering helen with questions she tried to make appear casual
but helen saw through her case and was in a state of glee
what she hoped most for was that carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for bo
it was that kind of treatment the young lady needed
and now was the great opportunity
helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint
neither this day nor the next however did he put in an appearance at the house though helen saw him twice on her rounds
he was busy as usual and greeted her as if nothing particular had happened
roy called twice once in the afternoon and again during the evening
he grew more likable upon longer acquaintance
this last visit he rendered bo speechless by teasing her about another girl carmichael was going to take to a dance
bo's face showed that her vanity could not believe this statement but that her intelligence of young men credited it with being possible
roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind
he made a dry casual little remark about the snow never melting on the mountains during the latter part of march and the look with which he accompanied this remark brought a blush to helen's cheek
after roy had departed bo said to helen confound that fellow
he sees right through me  my dear you're rather transparent these days murmured helen
you needn't talk
he gave you a dig retorted bo
he just knows you're dying to see the snow melt  gracious
i hope i'm not so bad as that
of course i want the snow melted and spring to come and flowers  hal ha
ha taunted bo
nell rayner do you see any green in my eyes
spring to come
yes the poet said in the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love
but that poet meant a young woman  helen gazed out of the window at the white stars
nell have you seen himsince i was hurt continued bo with an effort
him
who  oh whom do you suppose
i mean tom she responded and the last word came with a burst
tom
who's he
ah you mean las vegas
yes i've seen him  well did he ask aabout me  i believe he did ask how you weresomething like that  humph
nell i don't always trust you after that she relapsed into silence read awhile and dreamed awhile looking into the fire and then she limped over to kiss helen good night and left the room
next day she was rather quiet seeming upon the verge of one of the dispirited spells she got infrequently
early in the evening just after the lights had been lit and she had joined helen in the sittingroom a familiar step sounded on the loose boards of the porch
helen went to the door to admit carmichael
he was cleanshaven dressed in his dark suit which presented such marked contrast from his ridinggarb and he wore a flower in his buttonhole
nevertheless despite all this style he seemed more than usually the cool easy careless cowboy
evenin' miss helen he said as he stalked in
evenin' miss bo
how are youall  helen returned his greeting with a welcoming smile
good eveningtom said bo demurely
that assuredly was the first time she had ever called him tom
as she spoke she looked distractingly pretty and tantalizing
but if she had calculated to floor carmichael with the initial halfpromising wholly mocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause
the cowboy received that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times or had not heard it at all
helen decided if he was acting a part he was certainly a clever actor
he puzzled her somewhat but she liked his look and his easy manner and the something about him that must have been his unconscious sense of pride
he had gone far enough perhaps too far in his overtures to bo
how are you feelin' he asked
i'm better today she replied with downcast eyes
but i'm lame yet  reckon that bronc piled you up
miss helen said there shore wasn't any joke about the cut on your knee
now a fellar's knee is a bad place to hurt if he has to keep on ridin'  oh i'll be well soon
how's sam
i hope he wasn't crippled  thet samwhy he's so tough he never knowed he had a fall  tomii want to thank you for giving riggs what he deserved  she spoke it earnestly eloquently and for once she had no sly little intonation or pert allurement such as was her wont to use on this infatuated young man
aw you heard about that replied carmichael with a wave of his hand to make light of it
nothin' much
it had to be done
an' shore i was afraid of roy
he'd been bad
an' so would any of the other boys
i'm sorta lookin' out for all of them you know actin' as miss helen's foreman now  helen was unutterably tickled
the effect of his speech upon bo was stupendous
he had disarmed her
he had with the finesse and tact and suavity of a diplomat removed himself from obligation and the detachment of self the casual thing be apparently made out of his magnificent championship was bewildering and humiliating to bo
she sat silent for a moment or two while helen tried to fit easily into the conversation
it was not likely that bo would long be at a loss for words and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a twinkling
anyway plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep
she looked startled hurt wistful and finally sweetly defiant
butyou told riggs i was your girl thus bo unmasked her battery
and helen could not imagine how carmichael would ever resist that and the soft arch glance which accompanied it
helen did not yet know the cowboy any more than did bo
shore
i had to say thet
i had to make it strong before thet gang
i reckon it was presumin' of me an' i shore apologize  bo stared at him and then giving a little gasp she drooped
wal i just run in to say howdy an' to inquire after youall said carmichael
i'm goin' to the dance an' as flo lives out of town a ways i'd shore better rustle good night miss bo i hope you'll be ridin' sam soon
an' good night miss helen  bo roused to a very friendly and laconic little speech much overdone
carmichael strode out and helen bidding him goodby closed the door after him
the instant he had departed bo's transformation was tragic
flo
he meant flo stubbsthat ugly crosseyed bold little frump  bo expostulated helen
the young lady is not beautiful i grant but she's very nice and pleasant
i liked her  nell rayner men are no good
and cowboys are the worst declared bo terribly
why didn't you appreciate tom when you had him asked helen
bo had been growing furious but now the allusion in past tense to the conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her spirit
it was a very pale unsteady and miserable girl who avoided helen's gaze and left the room
next day bo was not approachable from any direction
helen found her a victim to a multiplicity of moods ranging from woe to dire dark broodings from them to' wistfulness and at last to a pride that sustained her
late in the afternoon at helen's leisure hour when she and bo were in the sittingroom horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted the porch
opening to a loud knock helen was surprised to see beasley
and out in the court were several mounted horsemen
helen's heart sank
this visit indeed had been foreshadowed
afternoon miss rayner said beasley doffing his sombrero
i've called on a little business deal
will you see me  helen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly
she might just as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with
come in she said and when he had entered she closed the door
my sister mr beasley  how d' you do miss said the rancher in bluff loud voice
bo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow
at close range beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather handsome man of perhaps thirtyfive heavy of build swarthy of skin and sloeblack of eye like that of the mexicans whose blood was reported to be in him
he looked crafty confident and selfcentered
if helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have distrusted him
i'd called sooner but i was waitin' for old jose the mexican who herded for me when i was pardner to your uncle said beasley and he sat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees
yes queried helen interrogatively
jose rustled over from magdalena an' now i can back up my claim miss rayner this hyar ranch ought to be mine an' is mine
it wasn't so big or so well stocked when al auchincloss beat me out of it
i reckon i'll allow for thet
i've papers an' old jose for witness
an' i calculate you'll pay me eighty thousand dollars or else i'll take over the ranch  beasley spoke in an ordinary matteroffact tone that certainly seemed sincere and his manner was blunt but perfectly natural
mr
beasley your claim is no news to me responded helen quietly
i've heard about it
and i questioned my uncle
he swore on his deathbed that he did not owe you a dollar
indeed he claimed the indebtedness was yours to him
i could find nothing in his papers so i must repudiate your claim
i will not take it seriously  miss rayner i can't blame you for takin' al's word against mine said beasley
an' your stand is natural
but you're a stranger here an' you know nothin' of stock deals in these ranges
it ain't fair to speak bad of the dead but the truth is thet al auchincloss got his start by stealin' sheep an' unbranded cattle
thet was the start of every rancher i know
it was mine
an' we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin'  helen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement
talk's cheap anywhere an' in the west talk ain't much at all  continued beasley
i'm no talker
i jest want to tell my case an' make a deal if you'll have it
i can prove more in black an' white an' with witness than you can
thet's my case
the deal i'd make is this let's marry an' settle a bad deal thet way  the man's direct assumption absolutely without a qualifying consideration for her woman's attitude was amazing ignorant and base but helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust
thank you mr beasley but i can't accept your offer she replied
would you take time an' consider he asked spreading wide his huge gloved hands
absolutely no  beasley rose to his feet
he showed no disappointment or chagrin but the bold pleasantness left his face and slight as that change was it stripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed
thet means i'll force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you off he said
mr
beasley even if i owed you that how could i raise so enormous a sum
i don't owe it
and i certainly won't be put off my property
you can't put me off  an' why can't i he demanded with lowering dark gaze
because your claim is dishonest
and i can prove it declared helen forcibly
who 're you goin' to prove it tothet i'm dishonest  to my mento your mento the people of pineto everybody
there's not a person who won't believe me  he seemed curious discomfited surlily annoyed and yet fascinated by her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she spiritedly defended her cause
an' how 're you goin' to prove all thet he growled
mr
beasley do you remember last fall when you met snake anson with his gang up in the woodsand hired him to make off with me asked helen in swift ringing words
the dark olive of beasley's bold face shaded to a dirty white
whaat he jerked out hoarsely
i see you remember
well milt dale was hidden in the loft of that cabin where you met anson
he heard every word of your deal with the outlaw  beasley swung his arm in sudden violence so hard that he flung his glove to the floor
as he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant hiss
then stalking to the door he jerked it open and slammed it behind him
his loud voice hoarse with passion preceded the scrape and crack of hoofs
shortly after supper that day when helen was just recovering her composure carmichael presented himself at the open door
bo was not there
in the dimming twilight helen saw that the cowboy was pale somber grim
oh what's happened cried helen
roy's been shot
it come off in turner's saloon but he ain't dead
we packed him over to widow cass's
an' he said for me to tell you he'd pull through  shot
pull through repeated helen in slow unrealizing exclamation
she was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood in all her external body
yes shot replied carmichael fiercely
an' whatever he says i reckon he won't pull through  o heaven how terrible burst out helen
he was so goodsuch a man
what a pity
oh he must have met that in my behalf
tell me what happened
who shot him  wal i don't know
an' thet's what's made me hoppin' mad
i wasn't there when it come off
an' he won't tell me  why not  i don't know thet either
i reckoned first it was because he wanted to get even
but after thinkin' it over i guess he doesn't want me lookin' up any one right now for fear i might get hurt
an' you're goin' to need your friends
thet's all i can make of roy  then helen hurriedly related the event of beasley's call on her that afternoon and all that had occurred
wal the halfbreed sonofagreaser ejaculated carmichael in utter confoundment
he wanted you to marry him  he certainly did
i must say it was aa rather abrupt proposal  carmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered behind his teeth
at last he let out an explosive breath
miss nell i've shore felt in my bones thet i'm the boy slated to brand thet big bull  oh he must have shot roy
he left here in a rage  i reckon you can coax it out of roy
fact is all i could learn was thet roy come in the saloon alone
beasley was there an' riggs  riggs interrupted helen
shore riggs
he come back again
but he'd better keep out of my way an' jeff mulvey with his outfit
turner told me he heard an argument an' then a shot
the gang cleared out leavin' roy on the floor
i come in a little later
roy was still layin' there
nobody was doin' anythin' for him
an' nobody had
i hold that against turner
wal i got help an' packed roy over to widow cass's
roy seemed all right
but he was too bright an' talky to suit me
the bullet hit his lung thet's shore
an' he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it
thet skunk turner might have lent a hand
an' if roy croaks i reckon i'll  tom why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody demanded helen angrily
'cause somebody's got to be killed 'round here
thet's why he snapped back
even soshould you risk leaving bo and me without a friend asked helen reproachfully
at that carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness
aw miss nell i'm only mad
if you'll just be patient with mean' mebbe coax me
but i can't see no other way out  let's hope and pray said helen earnestly
you spoke of my coaxing roy to tell who shot him
when can i see him  tomorrow i reckon
i'll come for you
fetch bo along with you
we've got to play safe from now on
an' what do you say to me an' hal sleepin' here at the ranchhouse  indeed i'd feel safer she replied
there are rooms
please come  allright
an' now i'll be goin' to fetch hal
shore wish i hadn't made you pale an' scared like this   about ten o'clock next morning carmichael drove helen and bo into pine and tied up the team before widow cass's cottage
the peach and appletrees were mingling blossoms of pink and white a drowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air rich darkgreen alfalfa covered the small orchard flat a wood fire sent up a lazy column of blue smoke and birds were singing sweetly
helen could scarcely believe that amid all this tranquillity a man lay perhaps fatally injured
assuredly carmichael had been somber and reticent enough to rouse the gravest fears
widow cass appeared on the little porch a gray bent worn but cheerful old woman whom helen had come to know as her friend
my land
i'm thet glad to see you miss helen she said
an' you've fetched the little lass as i've not got acquainted with yet  good morning mrs cass
howhow is roy replied helen anxiously scanning the wrinkled face
roy
now don't you look so scared
roy's 'most ready to git on his hoss an' ride home if i let him
he knowed you was acomin'
an' he made me hold a lookin'glass for him to shave
how's thet fer a man with a bullethole through him
you can't kill them mormons nohow  she led them into a little sittingroom where on a couch underneath a window roy beeman lay
he was wide awake and smiling but haggard
he lay partly covered with a blanket
his gray shirt was open at the neck disclosing bandages
mornin'girls he drawled
shore is good of you now comin' down  helen stood beside him bent over him in her earnestness as she greeted him
she saw a shade of pain in his eyes and his immobility struck her but he did not seem badly off
bo was pale roundeyed and apparently too agitated to speak
carmichael placed chairs beside the couch for the girls
wal what's ailin' you this nice mornin' asked roy eyes on the cowboy
huh
would you expect me to be wearin' the smile of a fellar goin' to be married retorted carmichael
shore you haven't made up with bo yet returned roy
bo blushed rosy red and the cowboy's face lost something of its somber hue
i allow it's none of your ddarn bizness if she ain't made up with me he said
las vegas you're a wonder with a hoss an' a rope an' i reckon with a gun but when it comes to girls you shore ain't there  i'm no mormon by golly
come ma cass let's get out of here so they can talk  folks i was jest agoin' to say thet roy's got fever an' he oughtn't t' talk too much said the old woman
then she and carmichael went into the kitchen and closed the door
roy looked up at helen with his keen eyes more kindly piercing than ever
my brother john was here
he'd just left when you come
he rode home to tell my folks i'm not so bad hurt an' then he's goin' to ride a beeline into the mountains  helen's eyes asked what her lips refused to utter
he's goin' after dale
i sent him
i reckoned weall sorta needed sight of thet doggone hunter  roy had averted his gaze quickly to bo
don't you agree with me lass  i sure do replied bo heartily
all within helen had been stilled for the moment of her realization and then came swell and beat of heart and inconceivable chafing of a tide at its restraint
can johnfetch dale outwhen the snow's so deep she asked unsteadily
shore
he's takin' two hosses up to the snowline
then if necessary he'll go over the pass on snowshoes
but i bet him dale would ride out
snow's about gone except on the north slopes an' on the peaks  thenwhen may iwe expect to see dale  three or four days i reckon
i wish he was here now miss helen there's trouble afoot  i realize that
i'm ready
did las vegas tell you about beasley's visit to me  no
you tell me replied roy
briefly helen began to acquaint him with the circumstances of that visit and before she had finished she made sure roy was swearing to himself
he asked you to marry him
jerusalem
thet i'd never have reckoned
thelowdown coyote of a greaser
wal miss helen when i met up with senor beasley last night he was shore spoilin' from somethin' now i see what thet was
an' i reckon i picked out the bad time  for what
roy what did you do  wal i'd made up my mind awhile back to talk to beasley the first chance i had
an' thet was it
i was in the store when i seen him go into turner's
so i followed
it was 'most dark
beasley an' riggs an' mulvey an' some more were drinkin' an' powwowin'
so i just braced him right then  roy
oh the way you boys court danger  but miss helen thet's the only way
to be afraid makes more danger
beasley 'peared civil enough first off
him an' me kept edgin' off an' his pards kept edgin' after us till we got over in a corner of the saloon
i don't know all i said to him
shore i talked a heap
i told him what my old man thought
an' beasley knowed as well as i thet my old man's not only the oldest inhabitant hereabouts but he's the wisest too
an' he wouldn't tell a lie
wal i used all his sayin's in my argument to show beasley thet if he didn't haul up short he'd end almost as short
beasley's thickheaded an' powerful conceited
vain as a peacock
he couldn't see an' he got mad
i told him he was rich enough without robbin' you of your ranch an'wal i shore put up a big talk for your side
by this time he an' his gang had me crowded in a corner an' from their looks i begun to get cold feet
but i was in it an' had to make the best of it
the argument worked down to his pinnin' me to my word that i'd fight for you when thet fight come off
an' i shore told him for my own sake i wished it 'd come off quick thenwalthen somethin' did come off quick  roy then he shot you exclaimed helen passionately
now miss helen i didn't say who done it replied roy with his engaging smile
tell me thenwho did  wal i reckon i sha'n't tell you unless you promise not to tell las vegas
thet cowboy is plumb off his head
he thinks he knows who shot me an' i've been lyin' somethin' scandalous
you see if he learnsthen he'll go gunnin'
an' miss helen thet texan is bad
he might get plugged as i didan' there would be another man put off your side when the big trouble comes  roy i promise you i will not tell las vegas replied helen earnestly
wal thenit was riggs roy grew still paler as he confessed this and his voice almost a whisper expressed shame and hate
thet fourflush did it
shot me from behind beasley
i had no chance
i couldn't even see him draw
but when i fell an' lay there an' the others dropped back then i seen the smokin' gun in his hand
he looked powerful important
an' beasley began to cuss him an' was cussin' him as they all run out  oh coward
the despicable coward cried helen
no wonder tom wants to find out exclaimed bo low and deep
i'll bet he suspects riggs  shore he does but i wouldn't give him no satisfaction  roy you know that riggs can't last out here  wal i hope he lasts till i get on my feet again  there you go
hopeless all you boys
you must spill blood murmured helen shudderingly
dear miss helen don't take on so
i'm like daleno man to hunt up trouble
but out here there's a sort of unwritten lawan eye for an eyea tooth for a tooth
i believe in god almighty an' killin' is against my religion but riggs shot methe same as shootin' me in the back  roy i'm only a womani fear fainthearted and unequal to this west  wait till somethin' happens to you
'supposin' beasley comes an' grabs you with his own dirty big paws an' after maulin' you some throws you out of your home
or supposin' riggs chases you into a corner  helen felt the start of all her physical beinga violent leap of blood
but she could only judge of her looks from the grim smile of the wounded man as he watched her with his keen intent eyes
my friend anythin' can happen he said
but let's hope it won't be the worst  he had begun to show signs of weakness and helen rising at once said that she and bo had better leave him then but would come to see him the next day
at her call carmichael entered again with mrs cass and after a few remarks the visit was terminated
carmichael lingered in the doorway
wal cheer up you old mormon he called
cheer up yourself you cross old bachelor retorted roy quite unnecessarily loud
can't you raise enough nerve to make up with bo  carmichael evacuated the doorway as if he had been spurred
he was quite red in the face while he unhitched the team and silent during the ride up to the ranchhouse
there he got down and followed the girls into the sitting room
he appeared still somber though not sullen and had fully regained his composure
did you find out who shot roy he asked abruptly of helen
yes
but i promised roy i would not tell replied helen nervously
she averted her eyes from his searching gaze intuitively fearing his next query
was it thetriggs  las vegas don't ask me
i will not break my promise  he strode to the window and looked out a moment and presently when he turned toward bo he seemed a stronger loftier more impelling man with all his emotions under control
bo will you listen to meif i swear to speak the truthas i know it  why certainly replied bo with the color coming swiftly to her face
roy doesn't want me to know because he wants to meet thet fellar himself
an' i want to know because i want to stop him before he can do more dirt to us or our friends
thet's roy's reason an' mine
an' i'm askin' you to tell me  but tomi oughtn't replied bo haltingly
did you promise roy not to tell  no  or your sister  no
i didn't promise either  wal then you tell me
i want you to trust me in this here matter
but not because i love you an' once had a wild dream you might care a little for me  ohtom faltered bo
listen
i want you to trust me because i'm the one who knows what's best
i wouldn't lie an' i wouldn't say so if i didn't know shore
i swear dale will back me up
but he can't be here for some days
an' thet gang has got to be bluffed
you ought to see this
i reckon you've been quick in savvyin' western ways
i couldn't pay you no higher compliment bo rayner now will you tell me  yes i will replied bo with the blaze leaping to her eyes
oh boplease don'tplease don't
wait implored helen
boit's between you an' me said carmichael
tom i'll tell you whispered bo
it was a lowdown cowardly trick roy was surroundedand shot from behind beasleyby that fourflush riggs    chapter xix  the memory of a woman had ruined milt dale's peace had confounded his philosophy of selfsufficient lonely happiness in the solitude of the wilds had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal significance of life
when he realized his defeat that things were not as they seemed that there was no joy for him in the coming of spring that he had been blind in his free sensorial indian relation to existence he fell into an inexplicably strange state a despondency a gloom as deep as the silence of his home
dale reflected that the stronger an animal the keener its nerves the higher its intelligence the greater must be its suffering under restraint or injury
he thought of himself as a high order of animal whose great physical need was action and now the incentive to action seemed dead
he grew lax
he did not want to move
he performed his diminishing duties under compulsion
he watched for spring as a liberation but not that he could leave the valley
he hated the cold he grew weary of wind and snow he imagined the warm sun the park once more green with grass and bright with daisies the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts would be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him
then he might gradually return to past contentment though it would never be the same
but spring coming early to paradise park brought a fever to dale's blooda fire of unutterable longing
it was good perhaps that this was so because he seemed driven to work climb tramp and keep ceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark
action strengthened his lax muscles and kept him from those motionless senseless hours of brooding
he at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never be histhe sweetness of a womana home full of light joy hope the meaning and beauty of children
but those dark moods were sinkings into a pit of hell
dale had not kept track of days and weeks
he did not know when the snow melted off three slopes of paradise park
all he knew was that an age had dragged over his head and that spring had come
during his restless waking hours and even when he was asleep there seemed always in the back of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from this trial a changed man ready to sacrifice his chosen lot to give up his lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature and to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service to people
nevertheless he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness until his ordeal was overuntil he could meet her and the world knowing himself more of a man than ever before
one bright morning while he was at his campfire the tame cougar gave a low growling warning
dale was startled
tom did not act like that because of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag
presently dale espied a horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces
and with that sight dale's heart gave a leap recalling to him a divination of his future relation to his kind
never had he been so glad to see a man
this visitor resembled one of the beemans judging from the way he sat his horse and presently dale recognized him to be john
at this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot soon reaching the pines and the camp
howdy there you ole b'arhunter called john waving his hand
for all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from dale
the horse was mud to his flanks and john was mud to his knees wet bedraggled worn and white
this hue of his face meant more than fatigue
howdy john replied dale
they shook hands
john wearily swung his leg over the pommel but did not at once dismount
his clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon the hunter
miltwhat 'n hell's wrong he queried
why  bust me if you ain't changed so i hardly knowed you
you've been sickall alone here  do i look sick  wal i should smile
thin an' pale an' down in the mouth
milt what ails you  i've gone to seed  you've gone off your head jest as roy said livin' alone here
you overdid it milt
an' you look sick  john my sickness is here replied dale soberly as he laid a hand on his heart
lung trouble ejaculated john
with thet chest an' up in this air
get out  nonot lung trouble said dale
i savvy
had a hunch from roy anyhow  what kind of a hunch  easy now dale ole man don't you reckon i'm ridin' in on you pretty early
look at thet hoss john slid off and waved a hand at the drooping beast then began to unsaddle him
wal he done great
we bogged some comin' over
an' i climbed the pass at night on the frozen snow  you're welcome as the flowers in may
john what month is it  by spades
are you as bad as thet
let's see
it's the twentythird of march  march
well i'm beat
i've lost my reckonin'an' a lot more maybe  thar declared john slapping the mustang
you can jest hang up here till my next trip
milt how 're your hosses  wintered fine  wal thet's good
we'll need two big strong hosses right off  what for queried dale sharply
he dropped a stick of wood and straightened up from the campfire
you're goin' to ride down to pine with methet's what for  familiarly then came back to dale the quiet intent suggestiveness of the beemans in moments foreboding trial
at this certain assurance of john's too significant to be doubted dale's thought of pine gave slow birth to a strange sensation as if he had been dead and was vibrating back to life
tell what you got to tell he broke out
quick as a flash the mormon replied roy's been shot
but he won't die
he sent for you
bad deal's afoot
beasley means to force helen rayner out an' steal her ranch  a tremor ran all through dale
it seemed another painful yet thrilling connection between his past and this vaguely calling future
his emotions had been broodings dreams longings
this thing his friend said had the sting of real life
then old al's dead he asked
long agoi reckon around the middle of february
the property went to helen
she's been doin' fine
an' many folks say it's a pity she'll lose it  she won't lose it declared dale
how strange his voice sounded to his own ears
it was hoarse and unreal as if from disuse
wal weall have our idees
i say she will
my father says so
carmichael says so  who's he  reckon you remember thet cowpuncher who came up with roy an' auchincloss after the girlslast fall  yes
they called him laslas vegas
i liked his looks  humph
you'll like him a heap when you know him
he's kept the ranch goin' for miss helen all along
but the deal's comin' to a head
beasley's got thick with thet riggs
you remember him  yes  wal he's been hangin' out at pine all winter watchin' for some chance to get at miss helen or bo
everybody's seen thet
an' jest lately he chased bo on hossbackgave the kid a nasty fall
roy says riggs was after miss helen
but i think one or t'other of the girls would do thet varmint
wal thet sorta started goin'son
carmichael beat riggs an' drove him out of town
but he come back
beasley called on miss helen an' offered to marry her so's not to take the ranch from her he said  dale awoke with a thundering curse
shore exclaimed john
i'd say the sameonly i'm religious
don't thet beadyeyed greaser's gall make you want to spit all over yourself
my gawd
but roy was mad
roy's powerful fond of miss helen an' bo wal then roy first chance he got braced beasley an' give him some straight talk
beasley was foamin' at the mouth roy said
it was then riggs shot roy
shot him from behind beasley when roy wasn't lookin'
an' riggs brags of bein' a gunfighter
mebbe thet wasn't a bad shot for him  i reckon replied dale as he swallowed hard
now just what was roy's message to me  wal i can't remember all roy said answered john dubiously
but roy shore was excited an' dead in earnest
he says 'tell milt what's happened
tell him helen rayner's in more danger than she was last fall
tell him i've seen her look away acrost the mountains toward paradise park with her heart in her eyes
tell him she needs him most of all
'  dale shook all over as with an attack of ague
he was seized by a whirlwind of passionate terrible sweetness of sensation when what he wildly wanted was to curse roy and john for their simpleminded conclusions
roy'scrazy panted dale
wal now miltthet's downright surprisin' of you
roy's the levelheadest of any fellars i know  man
if he made me believe himan' it turned out untruei'di'd kill him replied dale
untrue
do you think roy beeman would lie  but johnyou fellows can't see my case
nell rayner wants meneeds me
it can't be true  wal my lovesick pardit jest is true exclaimed john feelingly
thet's the hell of lifenever knowin'
but here it's joy for you
you can believe roy beeman about women as quick as you'd trust him to track your lost hoss
roy's married three girls
i reckon he'll marry some more
roy's only twentyeight an' he has two big farms
he said he'd seen nell rayner's heart in her eyes lookin' for youan' you can jest bet your life thet's true
an' he said it because he means you to rustle down there an' fight for thet girl  i'llgo said dale in a shaky whisper as he sat down on a pine log near the fire
he stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his feet while storm after storm possessed his breast
they were fierce and brief because driven by his will
in those few moments of contending strife dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which had made his winter a nightmare
and when he stood erect again it seemed that the old earth had a stirring electrifying impetus for his feet
something black bitter melancholy and morbid always unreal to him had passed away forever
the great moment had been forced upon him
he did not believe roy beeman's preposterous hint regarding helen but he had gone back or soared onward as if by magic to his old true self
mounted on dale's strongest horses with only a light pack an ax and their weapons the two men had reached the snowline on the pass by noon that day
tom the tame cougar trotted along in the rear
the crust of the snow now half thawed by the sun would not hold the weight of a horse though it upheld the men on foot
they walked leading the horses
travel was not difficult until the snow began to deepen then progress slackened materially
john had not been able to pick out the line of the trail so dale did not follow his tracks
an old blaze on the trees enabled dale to keep fairly well to the trail and at length the height of the pass was reached where the snow was deep
here the horses labored plowing through foot by foot
when finally they sank to their flanks they had to be dragged and goaded on and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their hoofs
it took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards of deep snow on the height of the pass
the cougar did not have great difficulty in following though it was evident he did not like such traveling
that behind them the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge of the steep descent where they had all they could do to hold back from sliding and rolling
fast time was made on this slope at the bottom of which began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls hard to locate
the men here performed herculean labors but they got through to a park where the snow was gone
the ground however soft and boggy in places was more treacherous than the snow and the travelers had to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite and then go on through the forest
when they reached bare and solid ground just before dark that night it was high time for the horses were ready to drop and the men likewise
camp was made in an open wood
darkness fell and the men were resting on bough beds feet to the fire with tom curled up close by and the horses still drooping where they had been unsaddled
morning however discovered them grazing on the long bleached grass
john shook his head when he looked at them
you reckoned to make pine by nightfall
how far is itthe way you'll go  fifty mile or thereabouts replied dale
wal we can't ride it on them critters  john we'd do more than that if we had to  they were saddled and on the move before sunrise leaving snow and bog behind
level parks and level forests led one after another to long slopes and steep descents all growing sunnier and greener as the altitude diminished
squirrels and grouse turkeys and deer and less tame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced
in this game zone however dale had trouble with tom
the cougar had to be watched and called often to keep him off of trails
tom doesn't like a long trip said dale
but i'm goin' to take him
some way or other he may come in handy  sic him onto beasley's gang replied john
some men are powerful scared of cougars
but i never was  nor me
though i've had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin'  the men talked but little
dale led the way with tom trotting noiselessly beside his horse
john followed close behind
they loped the horses across parks trotted through the forests walked slow up what few inclines they met and slid down the soft wet pinematted descents
so they averaged from six to eight miles an hour
the horses held up well under that steady travel and this without any rest at noon
dale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance
yet despite this the same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him strangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun nor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir him
his mind his heart his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating wine of expectation while his eyes and ears and nose had never been keener to register the facts of the forestland
he saw the black thing far ahead that resembled a burned stump but he knew was a bear before it vanished he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote and the red of fox and the small wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above the grass and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slowrising blades of bluebells where some softfooted beast had just trod
and he heard the melancholy notes of birds the twitter of grouse the sough of the wind the light dropping of pinecones the near and distant bark of squirrels the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge from a rival far away the cracking of twigs in the thickets the murmur of running water the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk and always the soft dull steady pads of the hoofs of the horses
the smells too were the sweet stinging ones of spring warm and pleasantthe odor of the clean fresh earth cutting its way through that thick strong fragrance of pine the smell of logs rotting in the sun and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snowwater
i smell smoke said dale suddenly as he reined in and turned for corroboration from his companion
john sniffed the warm air
wal you're more of an injun than me he replied shaking his head
they traveled on and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope
a long league of green slanted below them breaking up into straggling lines of trees and groves that joined the cedars and these in turn stretched on and down in grayblack patches to the desert that glittering and bare with streaks of somber hue faded in the obscurity of distance
the village of pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the great forest and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green
look there said dale pointing
some miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the slope forming a promontory and from it a thin pale column of smoke curled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of green
thet's your smoke shore enough replied john thoughtfully
now i jest wonder who's campin' there
no water near or grass for hosses  john that point's been used for smoke signals many a time  was jest thinkin' of thet same
shall we ride around there an' take a peek  no
but we'll remember that
if beasley's got his deep scheme goin' he'll have snake anson's gang somewhere close  roy said thet same
wal it's some three hours till sundown
the hosses keep up
i reckon i'm fooled for we'll make pine all right
but old tom there he's tired or lazy  the big cougar was lying down panting and his halfshut eyes were on dale
tom's only lazy an' fat
he could travel at this gait for a week
but let's rest a halfhour an' watch that smoke before movin' on
we can make pine before sundown   when travel had been resumed halfway down the slope dale's sharp eyes caught a broad track where shod horses had passed climbing in a long slant toward the promontory
he dismounted to examine it and john coming up proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise
dale made his deductions after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse waiting for john
wal what 'd you make of these here tracks asked that worthy
some horses an' a pony went along here yesterday an' today a single horse made that fresh track  wal milt for a hunter you ain't so bad at hoss tracks observed john but how many hosses went yesterday  i couldn't make outseveralmaybe four or five  six hosses an' a colt or little mustang unshod to be strictcorrect
wal supposin' they did
what 's it mean to us  i don't know as i'd thought anythin' unusual if it hadn't been for that smoke we saw off the rim an' then this here fresh track made along today
looks queer to me  wish roy was here replied john scratching his head
milt i've a hunch if he was he'd foller them tracks  maybe
but we haven't time for that
we can backtrail them though if they keep clear as they are here
an' we'll not lose any time either  that broad track led straight toward pine down to the edge of the cedars where amid some jagged rocks evidences showed that men had camped there for days
here it ended as a broad trail
but from the north came the single fresh track made that very day and from the east more in a line with pine came two tracks made the day before
and these were imprints of big and little hoofs
manifestly these interested john more than they did dale who had to wait for his companion
milt it ain't a colt'sthet little track avowed john
why notan' what if it isn't queried dale
wal it ain't because a colt always straggles back an' from one side to t'other
this little track keeps close to the big one
an' by george
it was made by a led mustang  john resembled roy beeman then with that leaping intent fire in his gray eyes
dale's reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call sharply to the lagging cougar
when they turned into the broad blossombordered road that was the only thoroughfare of pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the mountains
the horses were too tired for any more than a walk
natives of the village catching sight of dale and beeman and the huge gray cat following like a dog called excitedly to one another
a group of men in front of turner's gazed intently down the road and soon manifested signs of excitement
dale and his comrade dismounted in front of widow cass's cottage
and dale called as he strode up the little path
mrs cass came out
she was white and shaking but appeared calm
at sight of her john beeman drew a sharp breath
wal now he began hoarsely and left off
how's roy queried dale
lord knows i'm glad to see you boys
milt you're thin an' strangelookin'
roy's had a little setback
he got a shock today an' it throwed him off
feveran' now he's out of his head
it won't do no good for you to waste time seein' him
take my word for it he's all right
but there's others asfor the land's sakes milt dale you fetched thet cougar back
don't let him near me  tom won't hurt you mother said dale as the cougar came padding up the path
you were sayin' somethin'about others
is miss helen safe
hurry  ride up to see heran' waste no more time here  dale was quick in the saddle followed by john but the horses had to be severely punished to force them even to a trot
and that was a lagging trot which now did not leave torn behind
the ride up to auchincloss's ranchhouse seemed endless to dale
natives came out in the road to watch after he had passed
stern as dale was in dominating his feelings he could not wholly subordinate his mounting joy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe
but no matter what awaitednor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless circumstance about to be disclosed the wonderful and glorious fact of the present was that in a moment he would see helen rayner
there were saddled horses in the courtyard but no riders
a mexican boy sat on the porch bench in the seat where dale remembered he had encountered al auchincloss
the door of the big sittingroom was open
the scent of flowers the murmur of bees the pounding of hoofs came vaguely to dale
his eyes dimmed so that the ground when he slid out of his saddle seemed far below him
he stepped upon the porch
his sight suddenly cleared
a tight fullness at his throat made incoherent the words he said to the mexican boy
but they were understood as the boy ran back around the house
dale knocked sharply and stepped over the threshold
outside john true to his habits was thinking even in that moment of suspense about the faithful exhausted horses
as he unsaddled them he talked fer soft an' fat hosses winterin' high up wal you've done somethin'  then dale heard a voice in another room a step a creak of the door
it opened
a woman in white appeared
he recognized helen
but instead of the rich brown bloom and darkeyed beauty so hauntingly limned on his memory he saw a white beautiful face strained and quivering in anguish and eyes that pierced his heart
he could not speak
oh
my friendyou've come she whispered
dale put out a shaking hand
but she did not see it
she clutched his shoulders as if to feel whether or not he was real and then her arms went up round his neck
oh thank god
i knew you would come she said and her head sank to his shoulder
dale divined what he had suspected
helen's sister had been carried off
yet while his quick mind grasped helen's broken spiritthe unbalance that was reason for this marvelous and glorious acthe did not take other meaning of the embrace to himself
he just stood there transported charged like a tree struck by lightning making sure with all his keen senses so that he could feel forever how she was clinging round his neck her face over his bursting heart her quivering form close pressed to his
it'sbo he said unsteadily
she went riding yesterdayandnevercameback replied helen brokenly
i've seen her trail
she's been taken into the woods
i'll find her
i'll fetch her back he replied rapidly
with a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning
with another shock she raised her faceleaned back a little to look at him
you'll find herfetch her back  yes he answered instantly
with that ringing word it seemed to dale she realized how she was standing
he felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back while the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of scarlet
but she was brave in her confusion
her eyes never fell though they changed swiftly darkening with shame amaze and with feelings he could not read
i'm almostout of my head she faltered
no wonder
i saw that
but now you must get clearheaded
i've no time to lose  he led her to the door
john it's bo that's gone he called
since yesterday
send the boy to get me a bag of meat an' bread
you run to the corral an' get me a fresh horse
my old horse ranger if you can find him quick
an' rustle  without a word john leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just unsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard
then the big cougar seeing helen got up from where he lay on the porch and came to her
oh it's tom cried helen and as he rubbed against her knees she patted his head with trembling hand
you big beautiful pet
oh how i remember
oh how bo would love to  where's carmichael interrupted dale
out huntin' bo  yes
it was he who missed her first
he rode everywhere yesterday
last night when he came back he was wild
i've not seen him today
he made all the other men but hal and joe stay home on the ranch  right
an' john must stay too declared dale
but it's strange
carmichael ought to have found the girl's tracks
she was ridin' a pony  bo rode sam
he's a little bronc very strong and fast  i come across his tracks
how'd carmichael miss them  he didn't
he found themtrailed them all along the north range
that's where he forbade bo to go
you see they're in love with each other
they've been at odds
neither will give in
bo disobeyed him
there's hard ground off the north range so he said
he was able to follow her tracks only so far  were there any other tracks along with hers  no  miss helen i found them 'way southeast of pine up on the slope of the mountain
there were seven other horses makin' that trailwhen we run across it
on the way down we found a camp where men had waited
an' bo's pony led by a rider on a big horse come into that camp from the eastmaybe north a little
an' that tells the story  riggs ran her downmade off with her cried helen passionately
oh the villain
he had men in waiting
that's beasley's work
they were after me  it may not be just what you said but that's close enough
an' bo's in a bad fix
you must face that an' try to bear up underfears of the worst  my friend
you will save her  i'll fetch her back alive or dead  dead
oh my god helen cried and closed her eyes an instant to open them burning black
but bo isn't dead
i know thati feel it
she'll not die very easy
she's a little savage
she has no fear
she'd fight like a tigress for her life
she's strong
you remember how strong
she can stand anything
unless they murder her outright she'll livea long timethrough any ordeal
so i beg you my friend don't lose an hourdon't ever give up  dale trembled under the clasp of her hands
loosing his own from her clinging hold he stepped out on the porch
at that moment john appeared on ranger coming at a gallop
nell i'll never come back without her said dale
i reckon you can hopeonly be prepared
that's all
it's hard
but these damned deals are common out here in the west  suppose beasley comeshere exclaimed helen and again her hand went out toward him
if he does you refuse to get off replied dale
but don't let him or his greasers put a dirty hand on you
should he threaten forcewhy pack some clothesan' your valuablesan' go down to mrs cass's
an' wait till i come back  waittill youcome back she faltered slowly turning white again
her dark eyes dilated
miltyou're like las vegas
you'll kill beasley  dale heard his own laugh very cold and strange foreign to his ears
a grim deadly hate of beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt for this distressed girl
it was a sore trial to see her leaning there against the doorto be compelled to leave her alone
abruptly be stalked off the porch
tom followed him
the black horse whinnied his recognition of dale and snorted at sight of the cougar
just then the mexican boy returned with a bag
dale tied this with the small pack behind the saddle
john you stay here with miss helen said dale
an' if carmichael comes back keep him too
an' tonight if any one rides into pine from the way we come you be sure to spot him  i'll do thet milt responded john
dale mounted and turning for a last word to helen he felt the words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and brokenhearted with her hands to her bosom
he could not look twice
come on there you tom he called to the cougar
reckon on this track you'll pay me for all my trainin' of you  oh my friend came helen's sad voice almost a whisper to his throbbing ears
heaven help youto save her
i  then ranger started and dale heard no more
he could not look back
his eyes were full of tears and his breast ached
by a tremendous effort he shifted that emotioncalled on all the spiritual energy of his being to the duty of this grim task before him
he did not ride down through the village but skirted the northern border and worked round to the south where coming to the trail he had made an hour past he headed on it straight for the slope now darkening in the twilight
the big cougar showed more willingness to return on this trail than he had shown in the coming
ranger was fresh and wanted to go but dale held him in
a cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night
against the brightening stars dale saw the promontory lift its bold outline
it was miles away
it haunted him strangely calling
a night and perhaps a day separated him from the gang that held bo rayner prisoner
dale had no plan as yet
he had only a motive as great as the love he bore helen rayner
beasley's evil genius had planned this abduction
riggs was a tool a cowardly knave dominated by a stronger will
snake anson and his gang had lain in wait at that cedar camp had made that broad hoof track leading up the mountain
beasley had been there with them that very day
all this was as assured to dale as if he had seen the men
but the matter of dale's recovering the girl and doing it speedily strung his mental strength to its highest pitch
many outlines of action flashed through his mind as he rode on peering keenly through the night listening with practised ears
all were rejected
and at the outset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the gray form of the cougar long graceful heavy as he padded beside the horse
from the first thought of returning to help helen rayner he had conceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his pet
tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing but he had never been tried on men
dale believed he could make him trail anything yet he had no proof of this
one fact stood out of all dale's conjectures and it was that he had known men and brave men to fear cougars
far up on the slope in a little hollow where water ran and there was a little grass for ranger to pick dale haltered him and made ready to spend the night
he was sparing with his food giving tom more than he took himself
curled close up to dale the big cat went to sleep
but dale lay awake for long
the night was still with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered slope
dale saw hope in the stars
he did not seem to have promised himself or helen that he could save her sister and then her property
he seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled outside of his thinking
strange how this certainty was not vague yet irreconcilable with any plans he created
behind it somehow nameless with inconceivable power surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest of trails of scents of night of the nature of men lying down to sleep in the dark lonely woods of the nature of this great cat that lived its every action in accordance with his will
he grew sleepy and gradually his mind stilled with his last conscious thought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task
chapter xx  young burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in snake anson's gang for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty promontory
his instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open slopes below and to report any sight of a horse
a cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long pale column of smoke
this signalfire had been kept burning since sunrise
the preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars back of the promontory
but manifestly anson did not expect to remain there long
for after breakfast the packs had been made up and the horses stood saddled and bridled
they were restless and uneasy tossing bits and fighting flies
the sun now halfway to meridian was hot and no breeze blew in that sheltered spot
shady jones had ridden off early to fill the waterbags and had not yet returned
anson thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever was dealing a greasy dirty deck of cards his opponent being the squareshaped blackvisaged moze
in lieu of money the gamblers wagered with cedarberries each of which berries represented a pipeful of tobacco
jim wilson brooded under a cedartree his unshaven face a dirty dusthue a smoldering fire in his light eyes a sullen set to his jaw
every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at riggs and it seemed that a quick glance was enough
riggs paced to and fro in the open coatless and hatless his blackbroadcloth trousers and embroidered vest dusty and torn
an enormous gun bumped awkwardly in its sheath swinging below his hip
riggs looked perturbed
his face was sweating freely yet it was far from red in color
he did not appear to mind the sun or the flies
his eyes were staring dark wild shifting in gaze from everything they encountered
but often that gaze shot back to the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man
bo rayner's little booted feet were tied together with one end of a lasso and the other end trailed off over the ground
her hands were free
her ridinghabit was dusty and disordered
her eyes blazed defiantly out of a small pale face
harve riggs i wouldn't be standing in those cheap boots of yours for a million dollars she said sarcastically
riggs took no notice of her words
you pack that gunsheath wrong end out
what have you got the gun for anyhow she added tauntingly
snake anson let out a hoarse laugh and moze's black visage opened in a huge grin
jim wilson seemed to drink in the girl's words
sullen and somber he bent his lean head very still as if listening
you'd better shut up said riggs darkly
i will not shut up declared bo
then i'll gag you he threatened
gag me
why you dirty lowdown twobit of a bluff she exclaimed hotly i'd like to see you try it
i'll tear that long hair of yours right off your head  riggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching as if eager to throttle her
the girl leaned forward her face reddening her eyes fierce
you damned little cat muttered riggs thickly
i'll gag youif you don't stop squallin'  come on
i dare you to lay a hand on me harve riggs i'm not the least afraid of you
can't you savvy that
you're a liar a fourflush a sneak
why you're not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws  riggs took two long strides and bent over her his teeth protruding in a snarl and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head
bo's head jerked back with the force of the blow but she uttered no cry
are you goin' to keep your jaw shut he demanded stridently and a dark tide of blood surged up into his neck
i should smile i'm not retorted bo in cool deliberate anger of opposition
you've roped meand you've struck me
now get a clubstand off thereout of my reachand beat me
oh if i only knew cuss words fit for youi'd call you them  snake anson had stopped playing cards and was watching listening with halfdisgusted halfamused expression on his serpentlike face
jim wilson slowly rose to his feet
if any one had observed him it would have been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this scene yet all the while absorbed in himself
once he loosened the neckband of his blouse
riggs swung his arm more violently at the girl
but she dodged
you dog she hissed
oh if i only had a gun  her face then with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame held a tragic impelling beauty that stung anson into remonstrance
aw riggs don't beat up the kid he protested
thet won't do any good
let her alone  but she's got to shut up replied riggs
how 'n hell air you goin' to shet her up
mebbe if you get out of her sight she'll be quiet how about thet girl  anson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed bo
have i made any kick to you or your men yet she queried
it strikes me you 'ain't replied anson
you won't hear me make any so long as i'm treated decent said bo
i don't know what you've got to do with riggs
he ran me downroped medragged me to your camp
now i've a hunch you're waiting for beasley  girl your hunch 's correct said anson
well do you know i'm the wrong girl  what's thet
i reckon you're nell rayner who got left all old auchincloss's property  no
i'm bo rayner
nell is my sister
she owns the ranch
beasley wanted her  anson cursed deep and low
under his sharp bristling eyebrows he bent cunning green eyes upon riggs
say you
is what this kid says so  yes
she's nell rayner's sister replied riggs doggedly
ahuh
wal why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an' off up here to signal beasley
he ain't wantin' her
he wants the girl who owns the ranch
did you take one fer the othersame as thet day we was with you  guess i must have replied riggs sullenly
but you knowed her from her sister afore you come to my camp  riggs shook his head
he was paler now and sweating more freely
the dank hair hung wet over his forehead
his manner was that of a man suddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place
oh he's a liar exclaimed bo with contemptuous ring in her voice
he comes from my country
he has known nell and me for years  snake anson turned to look at wilson
jim now hyar's a queer deal this feller has rung in on us
i thought thet kid was pretty young
don't you remember beasley told us nell rayner was a handsome woman  wal pard anson if this heah gurl ain't handsome my eyes have gone pore drawled wilson
ahuh
so your texas chilvaree over the ladies is some operatin'  retorted anson with fine sarcasm
but thet ain't tellin' me what you think  wal i ain't tellin' you what i think yet
but i know thet kid ain't nell rayner
for i've seen her  anson studied his righthand man for a moment then taking out his tobaccopouch he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely to roll a cigarette
he put it between his thin lips and apparently forgot to light it
for a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and some scant sagebrush
riggs took to pacing up and down
wilson leaned as before against the cedar
the girl slowly recovered from her excess of anger
kid see hyar said anson addressing the girl if riggs knowed you wasn't nell an' fetched you along anyhowwhat 'd he do thet fur  he chased mecaught me
then he saw some one after us and he hurried to your camp
he was afraidthe cur  riggs heard her reply for he turned a malignant glance upon her
anson i fetched her because i know nell rayner will give up anythin' on earth for her he said in loud voice
anson pondered this statement with an air of considering its apparent sincerity
don't you believe him declared bo rayner bluntly
he's a liar
he's doublecrossing beasley and all of you  riggs raised a shaking hand to clench it at her
keep still or it 'll be the worse for you  riggs shut up yourself put in anson as he leisurely rose
mebbe it 'ain't occurred to you thet she might have some talk interestin' to me
an' i'm runnin' this hyar camp
 now kid talk up an' say what you like  i said he was doublecrossing you all replied the girl instantly
why i'm surprised you'd be caught in his company
my uncle al and my sweetheart carmichael and my friend dalethey've all told me what western men are even down to outlaws robbers cutthroat rascals like you
and i know the west well enough now to be sure that fourflush doesn't belong here and can't last here
he went to dodge city once and when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man
he was a swaggering bragging drinking gunfighter
he talked of the men he'd shot of the fights he'd had
he dressed like some of those gunthrowing gamblers
he was in love with my sister nell
she hated him
he followed us out west and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking indian
why nell and i couldn't even walk to the store in the village
he rode after me out on the rangechased me for that carmichael called riggs's bluff down in turner's saloon
dared him to draw
cussed him every name on the range
slapped and beat and kicked him
drove him out of pine
and now whatever he has said to beasley or you it's a dead sure bet he's playing his own game
that's to get hold of nell and if not herthen me
oh i'm out of breathand i'm out of names to call him
if i talked foreveri'd never beable todo him justice
but lend mea guna minute  jim wilson's quiet form vibrated with a start
anson with his admiring smile pulled his gun and taking a couple of steps forward held it out butt first
she stretched eagerly for it and he jerked it away
hold on there yelled riggs in alarm
damme jim if she didn't mean bizness exclaimed the outlaw
wal nowsee heah miss
would you bore himif you hed a gun  inquired wilson with curious interest
there was more of respect in his demeanor than admiration
no
i don't want his cowardly blood on my hands replied the girl
but i'd make him dancei'd make him run  shore you can handle a gun  she nodded her answer while her eyes flashed hate and her resolute lips twitched
then wilson made a singularly swift motion and his gun was pitched butt first to within a foot of her hand
she snatched it up cocked it aimed it all before anson could move
but he yelled  drop thet gun you little devil  riggs turned ghastly as the big blue gun lined on him
he also yelled but that yell was different from anson's
run or dance cried the girl
the big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand
she took both hands and called derisively as she fired again
the second bullet hit at riggs's feet scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over him
he bounded heretherethen darted for the rocks
a third time the heavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked riggs for he let out a hoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock
plug him
shoot off a leg yelled snake anson whooping and stamping as riggs got out of sight
jim wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness that had characterized his manner toward the girl
then as riggs disappeared wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girl's trembling hands
she was whiter than ever but still resolute and defiant
wilson took a glance over in the direction riggs had hidden and then proceeded to reload the gun
snake anson's roar of laughter ceased rather suddenly
hyar jim she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun he protested
i reckon she 'ain't nothin' ag'in' us replied wilson
ahuh
you know a lot about wimmen now don't you
but thet did my heart good
jim what 'n earth would you have did if thet 'd been you instead of riggs  the query seemed important and amazing
wilson pondered
shore i'd stood therestockstillan' never moved an eyewinker  an' let her shoot ejaculated anson nodding his long head
me too  so these rough outlaws inured to all the violence and baseness of their dishonest calling rose to the challenging courage of a slip of a girl
she had the one thing they respectednerve
just then a halloo from the promontory brought anson up with a start
muttering to himself he strode out toward the jagged rocks that hid the outlook
moze shuffled his burly form after anson
miss it shore was grandthet performance of mister gunman riggs  remarked jim wilson attentively studying the girl
much obliged to you for lending me your gun she replied
ii hope i hit hima little  wal if you didn't sting him then jim wilson knows nothin' about lead  jim wilson
are you the manthe outlaw my uncle al knew  reckon i am miss
fer i knowed al shore enough
what 'd he say aboot me  i remember once he was telling me about snake anson's gang
he mentioned you
said you were a real gunfighter
and what a shame it was you had to be an outlaw  wal
an' so old al spoke thet nice of me
it's tolerable likely i'll remember
an' now miss can i do anythin' for you  swift as a flash she looked at him
what do you mean  wal shore i don't mean much i'm sorry to say
nothin' to make you look like thet
i hev to be an outlaw shore as you're born
butmebbe there's a difference in outlaws  she understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden upflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader
please take this rope off my feet
let me walk a little
let me have aa little privacy
that fool watched every move i made
i promise not to run away
and oh
i'm thirsty  shore you've got sense he freed her feet and helped her get up
there'll be some fresh water any minit now if you'll wait  then he turned his back and walked over to where riggs sat nursing a bulletburn on his leg
say riggs i'm takin' the responsibility of loosin' the girl for a little spell
she can't get away
an' there ain't any sense in bein' mean  riggs made no reply and went on rolling down his trousers leg lapped a fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot
then he strode out toward the promontory
halfway there he encountered anson tramping back
beasley's comin' one way an' shady's comin' another
we'll be off this hot point of rock by noon said the outlaw leader
riggs went on to the promontory to look for himself
where's the girl demanded anson in surprise when he got back to the camp
wal she's walkin' 'round between heah an' pine drawled wilson
jim you let her loose  shore i did
she's been hawgtied all the time
an' she said she'd not run off
i'd take thet girl's word even to a sheepthief  ahuh
so would i for all of thet
but jim somethin's workin' in you
ain't you sort of rememberin' a time when you was youngan' mebbe knowed pretty kids like this one  wal if i am it 'll shore turn out bad fer somebody  anson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone
ahuh
so thet's how it's workin' he replied and flung himself down in the shade
young burt made his appearance then wiping his sallow face
his deepset hungry eyes upon which his comrades set such store roved around the camp
whar's the gurl he queried
jim let her go out fer a stroll replied anson
i seen jim was gittin' softy over her
haw
haw
haw  but snake anson did not crack a smile
the atmosphere appeared not to be congenial for jokes a fact burt rather suddenly divined
riggs and moze returned from the promontory the latter reporting that shady jones was riding up close
then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached to find a seat within ten yards of the group
they waited in silence until the expected horseman rode up with waterbottles slung on both sides of his saddle
his advent was welcome
all the men were thirsty
wilson took water to the girl before drinking himself
thet's an allfired hot ride fer water declared the outlaw shady who somehow fitted his name in color and impression
an' boss if it's the same to you i won't take it ag'in  cheer up shady
we'll be rustlin' back in the mountains before sundown said anson
hang me if that ain't the cheerfulest news i've hed in some days
hey moze  the blackfaced moze nodded his shaggy head
i'm sick an' sore of this deal broke out burt evidently encouraged by his elders
ever since last fall we've been hangin' 'roundtill jest lately freezin' in campsno moneyno drinkno grub wuth havin'
all on promises  not improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck the note of discord
wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment prevailing there
some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain
burt you ain't insinuatin' thet i made promises inquired anson ominously
no boss i ain't
you allus said we might hit it rich
but them promises was made to you
an' it 'd be jest like thet greaser to go back on his word now we got the gurl  son it happens we got the wrong one
our longhaired pard hyarmister riggshim with the big gunhe waltzes up with this sassy kid instead of the woman beasley wanted  burt snorted his disgust while shady jones roundly swearing pelted the smoldering campfire with stones
then they all lapsed into surly silence
the object of their growing scorn riggs sat a little way apart facing none of them but maintaining as bold a front as apparently he could muster
presently a horse shot up his ears the first indication of scent or sound imperceptible to the men
but with this cue they all except wilson sat up attentively
soon the crack of ironshod hoofs on stone broke the silence
riggs nervously rose to his feet
and the others still excepting wilson one by one followed suit
in another moment a rangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars up to the camp and his rider jumped off nimbly for so heavy a man
howdy beasley was anson's greeting
hello snake old man replied beasley as his bold snapping black eyes swept the group
he was dusty and hot and wet with sweat yet evidently too excited to feel discomfort
i seen your smoke signal first off an' jumped my hoss quick
but i rode north of pine before i headed 'round this way
did you corral the girl or did riggs
sayyou look queer
what's wrong here
you haven't signaled me for nothin'  snake anson beckoned to bo
come out of the shade
let him look you over  the girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her from sight
beasley stared aghasthis jaw dropped
thet's the kid sister of the woman i wanted he ejaculated
so we've jest been told  astonishment still held beasley
told he echoed
suddenly his big body leaped with a start
who got her
who fetched her  why mister gunman riggs hyar replied anson with a subtle scorn
riggs you got the wrong girl shouted beasley
you made thet mistake once before
what're you up to  i chased her an' when i got her seein' it wasn't nell raynerwhyi kept her anyhow replied riggs
an' i've got a word for your ear alone  man you're crazyqueerin' my deal thet way roared beasley
you heard my plans riggs this girlstealin' can't be done twice
was you drinkin' or locoed or what  beasley he was giving you the doublecross cut in bo rayner's cool voice
the rancher stared speechlessly at her then at anson then at wilson and last at riggs when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple blood
with one lunge he knocked riggs flat then stood over him with a convulsive hand at his gun
you whitelivered cardsharp
i've a notion to bore you
they told me you had a deal of your own an' now i believe it  yesi had replied riggs cautiously getting up
he was ghastly
but i wasn't doublecrossin' you
your deal was to get the girl away from home so you could take possession of her property
an' i wanted her  what for did you fetch the sister then demanded beasley his big jaw bulging
because i've a plan to  plan hell
you've spoiled my plan an' i've seen about enough of you  beasley breathed hard his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward the man who had crossed him his hand still hung low and clutching
beasley tell them to get my horse
i want to go home said bo rayner
slowly beasley turned
her words enjoined a silence
what to do with her now appeared a problem
i had nothin' to do with fetchin' you here an' i'll have nothin' to do with sendin' you back or whatever's done with you declared beasley
then the girl's face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire
you're as big a liar as riggs she cried passionately
and you're a thief a bully who picks on defenseless girls
oh we know your game
milt dale heard your plot with this outlaw anson to steal my sister
you ought to be hangedyou halfbreed greaser  i'll cut out your tongue hissed beasley
yes i'll bet you would if you had me alone
but these outlawsthese sheepthievesthese tools you hire are better than you and riggs what do you suppose carmichael will do to you
carmichael
he's my sweetheartthat cowboy
you know what he did to riggs
have you brains enough to know what he'll do to you  he'll not do much growled beasley
but the thick purplish blood was receding from his face
your cowpuncher  bah she interrupted and she snapped her fingers in his face
he's from texas
he's from texas  supposin' he is from texas demanded beasley in angry irritation
what's thet
texans are all over
there's jim wilson snake anson's righthand man
he's from texas
but thet ain't scarin' any one  he pointed toward wilson who shifted uneasily from foot to foot
the girl's flaming glance followed his hand
are you from texas she asked
yes miss i aman' i reckon i don't deserve it replied wilson
it was certain that a vague shame attended his confession
oh
i believed even a bandit from texas would fight for a helpless girl she replied in withering scorn of disappointment
jim wilson dropped his head
if any one there suspected a serious turn to wilson's attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw leader
beasley you're courtin' death he broke in
you bet you are added bo with a passion that made her listeners quiver
you've put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws
you may force my sister out of her home
but your day will come'
tom carmichael will kill you  beasley mounted his horse
sullen livid furious he sat shaking in the saddle to glare down at the outlaw leader
snake thet's no fault of mine the deal's miscarried
i was square
i made my offer for the workin' out of my plan
it 'ain't been done
now there's hell to pay an' i'm through  beasley i reckon i couldn't hold you to anythin' replied anson slowly
but if you was square you ain't square now
we've hung around an' tried hard
my men are all sore
an' we're broke with no outfit to speak of
me an' you never fell out before
but i reckon we might  do i owe you any moneyaccordin' to the deal demanded beasley
no you don't responded anson sharply
then thet's square
i wash my hands of the whole deal
make riggs pay up
he's got money an' he's got plans
go in with him  with that beasley spurred his horse wheeled and rode away
the outlaws gazed after him until he disappeared in the cedars
what'd you expect from a greaser queried shady jones
anson didn't i say so added burt
the blackvisaged moze rolled his eyes like a mad bull and jim wilson studiously examined a stick he held in his hands
riggs showed immense relief
anson stake me to some of your outfit an' i'll ride off with the girl he said eagerly
where'd you go now queried anson curiously
riggs appeared at a loss for a quick answer his wits were no more equal to this predicament than his nerve
you're no woodsman
an' onless you're plumb locoed you'd never risk goin' near pine or show down
there'll be real trackers huntin' your trail  the listening girl suddenly appealed to wilson
don't let him take me offalonein the woods she faltered
that was the first indication of her weakening
jim wilson broke into gruff reply
i'm not bossin' this gang  but you're a man she importuned
riggs you fetch along your precious firebrand an' come with us said anson craftily
i'm particular curious to see her brand you  snake lemme take the girl back to pine said jim wilson
anson swore his amaze
it's sense continued wilson
we've shore got our own troubles an' keepin' her 'll only add to them
i've a hunch
now you know i ain't often givin' to buckin' your sayso
but this deal ain't tastin' good to me
thet girl ought to be sent home  but mebbe there's somethin' in it for us
her sister 'd pay to git her back  wal i shore hope you'll recollect i offeredthet's all concluded wilson
jim if we wanted to git rid of her we'd let riggs take her off  remonstrated the outlaw leader
he was perturbed and undecided
wilson worried him
the long texan veered around full faced
what subtle transformation in him
like hell we would he said
it could not have been the tone that caused anson to quail
he might have been leader here but he was not the greater man
his face clouded
break camp he ordered
riggs had probably not heard that last exchange between anson and wilson for he had walked a few rods aside to get his horse
in a few moments when they started off burt jones and moze were in the lead driving the packhorses anson rode next the girl came between him and riggs and significantly it seemed jim wilson brought up the rear
this start was made a little after the noon hour
they zigzagged up the slope took to a deep ravine and followed it up to where it headed in the level forest
from there travel was rapid the packhorses being driven at a jogtrot
once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket into a glade to stand with ears high young burt halted the cavalcade
his wellaimed shot brought down a deer
then the men rode on leaving him behind to dress and pack the meat
the only other halt made was at the crossing of the first water a clear swift brook where both horses and men drank thirstily
here burt caught up with his comrades
they traversed glade and park and wended a crooked trail through the deepening forest and climbed bench after bench to higher ground while the sun sloped to the westward lower and redder
sunset had gone and twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when anson breaking his silence of the afternoon ordered a halt
the place was wild dismal a shallow vale between dark slopes of spruce
grass firewood and water were there in abundance
all the men were off throwing saddles and packs before the tired girl made an effort to get down
riggs observing her made a not ungentle move to pull her off
she gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand
keep your paws to yourself she said
no evidence of exhaustion was there in her spirit
wilson had observed this byplay but anson had not
what come off he asked
wal the honorable gunman riggs jest got caressed by the ladyas he was doin' the elegant replied moze who stood nearest
jim was you watchin' queried anson
his curiosity had held through the afternoon
he tried to yank her off an' she biffed him replied wilson
that riggs is jest daffy or plain locoed said snake in an aside to moze
boss you mean plain cussed
mark my words he'll hoodoo this outfit
jim was figgerin' correct  hoodoo cursed anson under his breath
many hands made quick work
in a few moments a fire was burning brightly water was boiling pots were steaming the odor of venison permeated the cool air
the girl had at last slipped off her saddle to the ground where she sat while riggs led the horse away
she sat there apparently forgotten a pathetic droop to her head
wilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces
one by one they fell with swish and soft crash
then the sliding ring of the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps
presently he appeared in the semidarkness dragging halftrimmed spruces behind him
he made several trips the last of which was to stagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs
these he spread under a low projecting branch of an aspen
then he leaned the bushy spruces slantingly against this branch on both sides quickly improvising a vshaped shelter with narrow aperture in front
next from one of the packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter
then touching the girl on the shoulder he whispered  when you're ready slip in there
an' don't lose no sleep by worryin' fer i'll be layin' right here  he made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow aperture
oh thank you
maybe you really are a texan she whispered back
mebbe was his gloomy reply
chapter xxi  the girl refused to take food proffered her by riggs but she ate and drank a little that wilson brought her then she disappeared in the spruce leanto
whatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in snake anson's gang were not manifest in this camp
each man seemed preoccupied as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not clear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows
they all smoked
then moze and shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire but it was a dull game in which either seldom spoke
riggs sought his blanket first and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from the spruce shelter which contained bo rayner
presently young burt went off grumbling to his bed
and not long afterward the cardplayers did likewise
snake anson and jim wilson were left brooding in silence beside the dying campfire
the night was dark with only a few stars showing
a fitful wind moaned unearthly through the spruce
an occasional thump of hoof sounded from the dark woods
no cry of wolf or coyote or cat gave reality to the wildness of forestland
by and by those men who had rolled in their blankets were breathing deep and slow in heavy slumber
jim i take it this hyar riggs has queered our deal said snake anson in low voice
i reckon replied wilson
an' i'm feared he's queered this hyar white mountain country fer us  shore i 'ain't got so far as thet
what d' ye mean snake  damme if i savvy was the gloomy reply
i only know what was bad looks growin' wuss
last fallan' winteran' now it's near april
we've got no outfit to make a long stand in the woods jim jest how strong is thet beasley down in the settlements  i've a hunch he ain't half as strong as he bluffs  me too
i got thet idee yesterday
he was scared of the kidwhen she fired up an' sent thet hotshot about her cowboy sweetheart killin' him
he'll do it jim
i seen that carmichael at magdalena some years ago
then he was only a youngster
but whew
mebbe he wasn't bad after toyin' with a little red liquor  shore
he was from texas she said  jim i savvied your feelin's was hurtby thet talk about texasan' when she up an' asked you  wilson had no rejoinder for this remark
wal lord knows i ain't wonderin'
you wasn't a hunted outlaw all your life
an' neither was i wilson i never was keen on this girl dealnow was i  i reckon it's honest to say no to thet replied wilson
but it's done
beasley 'll get plugged sooner or later
thet won't help us any
chasin' sheepherders out of the country an' stealin' sheepthet ain't stealin' gurls by a long sight
beasley 'll blame that on us an' be greaser enough to send some of his men out to hunt us
for pine an' show down won't stand thet long
there's them mormons
they'll be hell when they wake up
suppose carmichael got thet hunter dale an' them hawkeyed beemans on our trail  wal we'd cash inquick replied anson gruffly
then why didn't you let me take the gurl back home  wal come to think of thet jim i'm sore an' i need moneyan' i knowed you'd never take a dollar from her sister
an' i've made up my mind to git somethin' out of her  snake you're no fool
how 'll you do thet same an' do it quick  'ain't reckoned it out yet  wal you got aboot tomorrer an' thet's all returned wilson gloomily
jim what's ailin' you  i'll let you figger thet out  wal somethin' ails the whole gang declared anson savagely
with them it's nothin' to eatno whiskyno money to bet withno tobacco
but thet's not what's ailin' you jim wilson nor me  wal what is then queried wilson
with me it's a strange feelin' thet my day's over on these ranges
i can't explain but it jest feels so
somethin' in the air
i don't like them dark shadows out there under the spruces
savvy
an' as fer you jimwal you allus was half decent an' my gang's got too lowdown fer you  snake did i ever fail you  no you never did
you're the best pard i ever knowed
in the years we've rustled together we never had a contrary word till i let beasley fill my ears with his promises
thet's my fault
but jim it's too late  it mightn't have been too late yesterday  mebbe not
but it is now an' i'll hang on to the girl or git her worth in gold declared the outlaw grimly
snake i've seen stronger gangs than yours come an' go
them big bend gangs in my countrythem rustlersthey were all bad men
you have no likes of them gangs out heah
if they didn't get wiped out by rangers or cowboys why they jest naturally wiped out themselves
thet's a law i recognize in relation to gangs like them
an' as for yourswhy anson it wouldn't hold water against one real gunslinger  ahuh' then if we ran up ag'in' carmichael or some such fellarwould you be suckin' your finger like a baby  wal i wasn't takin' count of myself
i was takin' generalities  aw what 'n hell are them asked anson disgustedly
jim i know as well as you thet this hyar gang is hard put
we're goin' to be trailed an' chased
we've got to hidebe on the go all the timehere an' thereall over in the roughest woods
an' wait our chance to work south  shore
but snake you ain't takin' no count of the feelin's of the menan' of mine an' yours
i'll bet you my hoss thet in a day or so this gang will go to pieces  i'm feared you spoke what's been crowdin' to git in my mind replied anson
then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation
the outlaw was brave but all men of the wilds recognized a force stronger than themselves
he sat there resembling a brooding snake with basilisk eyes upon the fire
at length he arose and without another word to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark quiet forms of the sleepers
jim wilson remained beside the flickering fire
he was reading something in the red embers perhaps the past
shadows were on his face not all from the fading flames or the towering spruces
ever and anon he raised his head to listen not apparently that he expected any unusual sound but as if involuntarily
indeed as anson had said there was something nameless in the air
the black forest breathed heavily in fitful moans of wind
it had its secrets
the glances wilson threw on all sides betrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night though it hid him
wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black circle of spruce
he might have been reflecting on the strange reaction happening to every man in that group since a girl had been brought among them
nothing was clear however the forest kept its secret as did the melancholy wind the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts with their dark secrets locked in their hearts
after a while wilson put some sticks on the red embers then pulled the end of a log over them
a blaze sputtered up changing the dark circle and showing the sleepers with their set shadowed faces upturned
wilson gazed on all of them a sardonic smile on his lips and then his look fixed upon the sleeper apart from the othersriggs
it might have been the false light of flame and shadow that created wilson's expression of dark and terrible hate
or it might have been the truth expressed in that lonely unguarded hour from the depths of a man born in the southa man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all womanhoodby whose strange wild outlawed bloody life of a gunfighter he must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his fame
it was a long gaze wilson rested upon riggsas strange and secretive as the forest wind moaning down the great aislesand when that dark gaze was withdrawn wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one ill whom spirit had liberated force
he laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had entered and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily stretched his long length to rest
the campfire blazed up showing the exquisite green and brownflecked festooning of the spruce branches symmetrical and perfect yet so irregular and then it burned out and died down leaving all in the dim gray starlight
the horses were not moving around the moan of night wind had grown fainter the low hum of insects was dying away even the tinkle of the brook had diminished
and that growth toward absolute silence continued yet absolute silence was never attained
life abided in the forest only it had changed its form for the dark hours
anson's gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour common to all woodsmen hunters or outlaws to whom the break of day was welcome
these companionsanson and riggs includedmight have hated to see the dawn come
it meant only another meager meal then the weary packing and the long long ride to nowhere in particular and another meager mealall toiled for without even the necessities of satisfactory living and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that made their life significant and certainly with a growing sense of approaching calamity
the outlaw leader rose surly and crossgrained
he had to boot burt to drive him out for the horses
riggs followed him
shady jones did nothing except grumble
wilson by common consent always made the sourdough bread and he was slow about it this morning
anson and moze did the rest of the work without alacrity
the girl did not appear
is she dead growled anson
no she ain't replied wilson looking up
she's sleepin'
let her sleep
she'd shore be a sight better off if she was daid  ahuh
so would all of this hyar outfit was anson's response
wal snaake i shore reckon we'll all be thet there soon drawled wilson in his familiar cool and irritating tone that said so much more than the content of the words
anson did not address the texas member of his party again
burt rode bareback into camp driving half the number of the horses riggs followed shortly with several more
but three were missed one of them being anson's favorite
he would not have budged without that horse
during breakfast he growled about his lazy men and after the meal tried to urge them off
riggs went unwillingly
burt refused to go at all
nix
i footed them hills all i'm agoin' to he said
an' from now on i rustle my own hoss  the leader glared his reception of this opposition
perhaps his sense of fairness actuated him once more for he ordered shady and moze out to do their share
jim you're the best tracker in this outfit
suppose you go suggested anson
you allus used to be the first one off  times has changed snake was the imperturbable reply
wal won't you go demanded the leader impatiently
i shore won't  wilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the girl in camp with one or any or all of anson's gang but the truth was as significant as if he had shouted it
the slowthinking moze gave wilson a sinister look
boss ain't it funny how a pretty wench began shady jones sarcastically
shut up you fool broke in anson
come on i'll help rustle them hosses  after they had gone burt took his rifle and strolled off into the forest
then the girl appeared
her hair was down her face pale with dark shadows
she asked for water to wash her face
wilson pointed to the brook and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean scarf from his pack and carried them to her
upon her return to the campfire she looked very different with her hair arranged and the red stains in her cheeks
miss air you hungry asked wilson
yes i am she replied
he helped her to portions of bread venison and gravy and a cup of coffee
evidently she relished the meat but she had to force down the rest
where are they all she asked
rustlin' the hosses  probably she divined that he did not want to talk for the fleeting glance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had changed
presently she sought a seat under the aspentree out of the sun and the smoke continually blowing in her face and there she stayed a forlorn little figure for all the resolute lips and defiant eyes
the texan paced to and fro beside the campfire with bent head and hands locked behind him
but for the swinging gun he would have resembled a lanky farmer coatless and hatless with his brown vest open his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots
and neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for a long time
at length however after peering into the woods and listening he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment and then walked off around the spruces
no sooner had he disappearedin fact so quickly afterward that it presupposed design instead of accidentthan riggs came running from the opposite side of the glade
he ran straight to the girl who sprang to her feet
i hidtwo of thehorses he panted husky with excitement
i'll taketwo saddles
you grab some grub
we'll run for it  no she cried stepping back
but it's not safefor ushere he said hurriedly glancing all around
i'll take youhome
i swear not safei tell youthis gang's after me
hurry  he laid hold of two saddles one with each hand
the moment had reddened his face brightened his eyes made his action strong
i'm saferhere with this outlaw gang she replied
you won't come his color began to lighten then and his face to distort
he dropped his hold on the saddles
harve riggs i'd rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than spend an hour alone with you she flashed at him in unquenchable hate
i'll drag you  he seized her but could not hold her
breaking away she screamed
help  that whitened his face drove him to frenzy
leaping forward he struck her a hard blow across the mouth
it staggered her and tripping on a saddle she fell
his hands flew to her throat ready to choke her
but she lay still and held her tongue
then he dragged her to her feet
hurry nowgrab that packan' follow me again riggs laid hold of the two saddles
a desperate gleam baleful and vainglorious flashed over his face
he was living his one great adventure
the girl's eyes dilated
they looked beyond him
her lips opened
scream again an' i'll kill you he cried hoarsely and swiftly
the very opening of her lips had terrified riggs
reckon one scream was enough spoke a voice slow but without the drawl easy and cool yet incalculable in some terrible sense
riggs wheeled with inarticulate cry
wilson stood a few paces off with his gun half leveled low down
his face seemed as usual only his eyes held a quivering light intensity like boiling molten silver
girl what made thet blood on your mouth  riggs hit me she whispered
then at something she feared or saw or divined she shrank back dropped on her knees and crawled into the spruce shelter
wal riggs i'd invite you to draw if thet 'd be any use said wilson
this speech was reflective yet it hurried a little
riggs could not draw nor move nor speak
he seemed turned to stone except his jaw which slowly fell
harve riggs gunman from down missouri way continued the voice of incalculable intent reckon you've looked into a heap of gunbarrels in your day
shore
wal look in this heah one  wilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with riggs's starting eyes
wasn't you heard to brag in turner's saloonthet you could see lead comin'an' dodge it
shore you must be swift
dodge this heah bullet  the gun spouted flame and boomed
one of riggs's starting popping eyesthe right onewent out like a lamp
the other rolled horribly then set in blank dead fixedness
riggs swayed in slow motion until a lost balance felled him heavily an inert mass
wilson bent over the prostrate form
strange violent contrast to the cool scorn of the preceding moment
hissing spitting as if poisoned by passion he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to express on a living counterfeit
wilson was shaken as if by a palsy
he choked over passionate incoherent invective
it was class hate first then the hate of real manhood for a craven then the hate of disgrace for a murder
no man so fair as a gunfighter in the western creed of an even break
wilson's terrible cataclysm of passion passed
straightening up he sheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire
not many moments afterward he jerked his head high and listened
horses were softly thudding through the forest
soon anson rode into sight with his men and one of the strayed horses
it chanced too that young burt appeared on the other side of the glade
he walked quickly as one who anticipated news
snake anson as he dismounted espied the dead man
jimi thought i heard a shot  the others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted by sight of sudden death
that emotion was only momentary
shot his lamp out ejaculated moze
wonder how gunman riggs liked thet plumb center peg exclaimed shady jones with a hard laugh
back of his head all gone gasped young burt
not improbably he had not seen a great many bulletmarked men
jimthe longhaired fool didn't try to draw on you exclaimed snake anson astounded
wilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing
what was it over added anson curiously
he hit the gurl replied wilson
then there were longdrawn exclamations all around and glance met glance
jim you saved me the job continued the outlaw leader
an' i'm much obliged fellars search riggs an' we'll divvy thet all right jim  shore an' you can have my share  they found banknotes in the man's pocket and considerable gold worn in a moneybelt around his waist
shady jones appropriated his boots and moze his gun
then they left him as he had fallen
jim you'll have to track them lost hosses
two still missin' an' one of them's mine called anson as wilson paced to the end of his beat
the girl heard anson for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and called riggs said he'd hid two of the horses
they must be close
he came that way  howdy kid
thet's good news replied anson
his spirits were rising
he must hev wanted you to slope with him  yes
i wouldn't go  an' then he hit you  yes  wal recallin' your talk of yestiddy i can't see as mister riggs lasted much longer hyar than he'd hev lasted in texas
we've some of thet great country right in our outfit  the girl withdrew her white face
it's break camp boys was the leader's order
a couple of you look up them hosses
they'll be hid in some thick spruces
the rest of us 'll pack   soon the gang was on the move heading toward the height of land and swerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not leave any tracks
they did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon but they climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau that stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks
here rose the great and gloomy forest of firs and pines with the spruce overshadowed and thinned out
the last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome a zigzag winding breaking climbing hunt for the kind of campsite suited to anson's fancy
he seemed to be growing strangely irrational about selecting places to camp
at last for no reason that could have been manifest to a good woodsman he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the densest forest that had been traversed
the opening if such it could have been called was not a park or even a glade
a dark cliff with strange holes rose to one side but not so high as the lofty pines that brushed it
along its base babbled a brook running over such formation of rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different sounds some singing others melodious and one at least of a hollow weird deep sound not loud but strangely penetrating
sure spooky i say observed shady sentiently
the little uplift of mood coincident with the rifling of riggs's person had not worn over to this evening camp
what talk the outlaws indulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones
the place enjoined silence
wilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the night before
only he advised her not to starve herself she must eat to keep up her strength
she complied at the expense of considerable effort
as it had been a backbreaking day in which all of them except the girl had climbed miles on foot they did not linger awake long enough after supper to learn what a wild weird and pitchblack spot the outlaw leader had chosen
the little spaces of open ground between the hugetrunked pinetrees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading foliage
not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that stygian pit
the wind cutting down over abrupt heights farther up sang in the pineneedles as if they were strings vibrant with chords
dismal creaks were audible
they were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one another but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince any human that they were other than ghostly
then despite the wind and despite the changing murmur of the brook there seemed to be a silence insulating them as deep and impenetrable as the darkness
but the outlaws who were fugitives now slept the sleep of the weary and heard nothing
they awoke with the sun when the forest seemed smoky in a golden gloom when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day
the horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night a circumstance that anson was not slow to appreciate
it ain't no cheerful camp but i never seen a safer place to hole up in he remarked to wilson
wal yesif any place is safe replied that ally dubiously
we can watch our back tracks
there ain't any other way to git in hyar thet i see  snake we was tolerable fair sheeprustlers but we're no good woodsmen  anson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his mainstay
then he sent burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other men at cards
as they now had the means to gamble they at once became absorbed
wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the gamblers and the drooping figure of the girl
the morning air was keen and she evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the campfire had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell
a couple of hours passed the sun climbed high the air grew warmer
once the outlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavytimbered slopes that inclosed the camp
jim them hosses are strayin' off he observed
wilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small open patches in the direction of the horses
they had grazed around from the right toward the outlet of the brook
here headed a ravine dense and green
two of the horses had gone down
wilson evidently heard them though they were not in sight and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of them and drive them back
the invisible brook ran down over the rocks with murmur and babble
he halted with instinctive action
he listened
forest sounds soft lulling came on the warm pinescented breeze
it would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls
he moved on cautiously and turned into a little open mossy spot brownmatted and odorous full of ferns and bluebells
in the middle of this deep in the moss he espied a huge round track of a cougar
he bent over it
suddenly he stiffened then straightened guardedly
at that instant he received a hard prod in the back
throwing up his hands he stood still then slowly turned
a tall hunter in gray buckskin grayeyed and squarejawed had him covered with a cocked rifle
and beside this hunter stood a monster cougar snarling and blinking
chapter xxii  howdy dale drawled wilson
reckon you're a little previous on me  sssssh
not so loud said the hunter in low voice
you're jim wilson  shore am
say dale you showed up soon
or did you jest happen to run acrost us  i've trailed you
wilson i'm after the girl  i knowed thet when i seen you  the cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master and he opened his mouth showing great yellow fangs and spat at wilson
the outlaw apparently had no fear of dale or the cocked rifle but that huge snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness
wilson i've heard you spoken of as a white outlaw said dale
mebbe i am
but shore i'll be a scared one in a minit
dale he's goin' to jump me  the cougar won't jump you unless i make him
wilson if i let you go will you get the girl for me  wal lemme see
supposin' i refuse queried wilson shrewdly
then one way or another it's all up with you  reckon i 'ain't got much choice
yes i'll do it
but dale are you goin' to take my word for thet an' let me go back to anson  yes i am
you're no fool
an' i believe you're square
i've got anson and his gang corralled
you can't slip menot in these woods
i could run off your horsespick you off one by oneor turn the cougar loose on you at night  shore
it's your game
anson dealt himself this hand
between you an' me dale i never liked the deal  who shot riggs
i found his body  wal yours truly was around when thet come off replied wilson with an involuntary little shudder
some thought made him sick
the girl
is she safeunharmed queried dale hurriedly
she's shore jest as safe an' sound as when she was home
dale she's the gamest kid thet ever breathed
why no one could hev ever made me believe a girl a kid like her could hev the nerve she's got
nothin's happened to her 'cept riggs hit her in the mouth
i killed him for thet an' so help me god i believe it's been workin' in me to save her somehow
now it'll not be so hard  but how demanded dale
lemme see wal i've got to sneak her out of camp an' meet you
thet's all  it must be done quick  but dale listen remonstrated wilson earnestly
too quick 'll be as bad as too slow
snake is sore these days gittin' sorer all the time
he might savvy somethin' if i ain't careful an' kill the girl or do her harm
i know these fellars
they're all ready to go to pieces
an' shore i must play safe
shore it'd be safer to have a plan  wilson's shrewd light eyes gleamed with an idea
he was about to lower one of his upraised hands evidently to point to the cougar when he thought better of that
anson's scared of cougars
mebbe we can scare him an' the gang so it 'd be easy to sneak the girl off
can you make thet big brute do tricks
rush the camp at night an' squall an' chase off the horses  i'll guarantee to scare anson out of ten years' growth replied dale
shore it's a go then resumed wilson as if glad
i'll post the girlgive her a hunch to do her part
you sneak up tonight jest before dark
i'll hev the gang worked up
an' then you put the cougar to his tricks whatever you want
when the gang gits wild i'll grab the girl an' pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an' whistle fer you
but mebbe thet ain't so good
if thet cougar comes pilin' into camp he might jump me instead of one of the gang
an' another hunch
he might slope up on me in the dark when i was tryin' to find you
shore thet ain't appealin' to me  wilson this cougar is a pet replied dale
you think he's dangerous but he's not
no more than a kitten
he only looks fierce
he has never been hurt by a person an' he's never fought anythin' himself but deer an' bear
i can make him trail any scent
but the truth is i couldn't make him hurt you or anybody
all the same he can be made to scare the hair off any one who doesn't know him  shore thet settles me
i'll be havin' a grand joke while them fellars is scared to death dale you can depend on me
an' i'm beholdin' to you fer what 'll square me some with myself tonight an' if it won't work then tomorrer night shore  dale lowered the rifle
the big cougar spat again
wilson dropped his hands and stepping forward split the green wall of intersecting spruce branches
then he turned up the ravine toward the glen
once there in sight of his comrades his action and expression changed
hosses all thar jim asked anson as he picked up his cards
shore
they act awful queer them hosses replied
wilson
they're afraid of somethin'  ahuh
silvertip mebbe muttered anson
jim you jest keep watch of them hosses
we'd be done if some tarnal varmint stampeded them  reckon i'm elected to do all the work now complained wilson while you cardsharps cheat each other
rustle the hossesan' water an' firewood
cook an' wash hey  no one i ever seen can do them camp tricks any better 'n jim wilson  replied anson
jim you're a lady's man an' thar's our pretty hoodoo over thar to feed an' amoose remarked shady jones with a smile that disarmed his speech
the outlaws guffawed
git out jim you're breakin' up the game said moze who appeared loser
wal thet gurl would starve if it wasn't fer me replied wilson genially and he walked over toward her beginning to address her quite loudly as he approached
wal miss i'm elected cook an' i'd shore like to heah what you fancy fer dinner  the outlaws heard for they guffawed again
haw
haw
if jim ain't funny exclaimed anson
the girl looked up amazed
wilson was winking at her and when he got near he began to speak rapidly and low
i jest met dale down in the woods with his pet cougar
he's after you
i'm goin' to help him git you safe away
now you do your part
i want you to pretend you've gone crazy
savvy
act out of your head
shore i don't care what you do or say only act crazy
an' don't be scared
we're goin' to scare the gang so i'll hev a chance to sneak you away
tonight or tomorrowshore  before he began to speak she was pale sad dull of eye
swiftly with his words she was transformed and when he had ended she did not appear the same girl
she gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and nodded her head rapidly
yes i understand
i'll do it she whispered
the outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air confounded amid his shrewd acting and he did not collect himself until halfway back to his comrades
then beginning to hum an old darky tune he stirred up and replenished the fire and set about preparation for the midday meal
but he did not miss anything going on around him
he saw the girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over her face
wilson back to his comrades grinned his glee and he wagged his head as if he thought the situation was developing
the gambling outlaws however did not at once see the girl preening herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle
busted ejaculated anson with a curse as he slammed down his cards
if i ain't hoodooed i'm a twobit of a gambler  sartin you're hoodooed said shady jones in scorn
is thet jest dawnin' on you  boss you play like a cow stuck in the mud remarked moze laconically
fellars it ain't funny declared anson with pathetic gravity
i'm jest gittin' on to myself
somethin's wrong
since 'way last fall no lucknothin' but the wust end of everythin'
i ain't blamin' anybody
i'm the boss
it's me thet's off  snake shore it was the gurl deal you made rejoined wilson who had listened
i told you
our troubles hev only begun
an' i can see the windup
look  wilson pointed to where the girl stood her hair flying wildly all over her face and shoulders
she was making most elaborate bows to an old stump sweeping the ground with her tresses in her obeisance
anson started
he grew utterly astounded
his amaze was ludicrous
and the other two men looked to stare to equal their leader's bewilderment
what 'n hell's come over her asked anson dubiously
must hev perked up
but she ain't feelin' thet gay  wilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger
shore i was scared of her this mawnin' he whispered
naw exclaimed anson incredulously
if she hain't queer i never seen no queer wimmin vouchsafed shady jones and it would have been judged by the way he wagged his head that he had been all his days familiar with women
moze looked beyond words and quite alarmed
i seen it comin' declared wilson very much excited
but i was scared to say so
youall made fun of me aboot her
now i shore wish i had spoken up  anson nodded solemnly
he did not believe the evidence of his sight but the facts seemed stunning
as if the girl were a dangerous and incomprehensible thing he approached her step by step
wilson followed and the others appeared drawn irresistibly
hey tharkid called anson hoarsely
the girl drew her slight form up haughtily
through her spreading tresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader
but she deigned not to reply
hey tharyou rayner girl added anson lamely
what's ailin' you  my lord
did you address me she asked loftily
shady jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some humor from the situation as his dark face began to break its strain
aww breathed anson heavily
ophelia awaits your command my lord
i've been gathering flowers  she said sweetly holding up her empty hands as if they contained a bouquet
shady jones exploded in convulsed laughter
but his merriment was not shared
and suddenly it brought disaster upon him
the girl flew at him
why do you croak you toad
i will have you whipped and put in irons you scullion she cried passionately
shady underwent a remarkable change and stumbled in his backward retreat
then she snapped her fingers in moze's face
you black devil
get hence
avaunt  anson plucked up courage enough to touch her
aww
now ophelyar  probably he meant to try to humor her but she screamed and he jumped back as if she might burn him
she screamed shrilly in wild staccato notes
you
you she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader
you brute to women
you ran off from your wife  anson turned plumcolor and then slowly white
the girl must have sent a random shot home
and now the devil's turned you into a snake
a long scaly snake with green eyes
uugh
you'll crawl on your belly soonwhen my cowboy finds you
and he'll tramp you in the dust  she floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully arms spread and hair flying and then apparently oblivious of the staring men she broke into a low sweet song
next she danced around a pine then danced into her little green inclosure
from which presently she sent out the most doleful moans
aww
what a shame burst out anson
thet fine healthy nervy kid
clean gone
daffy
crazy 'n a bedbug  shore it's a shame protested wilson
but it's wuss for us
lord
if we was hoodooed before what will we be now
didn't i tell you snake anson
you was warned
ask shady an' mozethey see what's up  no luck 'll ever come our way ag'in predicted shady mournfully
it beats me boss it beats me muttered moze
a crazy woman on my hands
if thet ain't the last straw broke out anson tragically as he turned away
ignorant superstitious worked upon by things as they seemed the outlaw imagined himself at last beset by malign forces
when he flung himself down upon one of the packs his big redhaired hands shook
shady and moze resembled two other men at the end of their ropes
wilson's tense face twitched and he averted it as apparently he fought off a paroxysm of some nature
just then anson swore a thundering oath
crazy or not i'll git gold out of thet kid he roared
but man talk sense
are you gittin' daffy too
i declare this outfit's been eatin' loco
you can't git gold fer her said wilson deliberately
why can't i  'cause we're tracked
we can't make no dickers
why in another day or so we'll be dodgin' lead  tracked
whar 'd you git thet idee
as soon as this queried anson lifting his head like a striking snake
his men likewise betrayed sudden interest
shore it's no idee
i 'ain't seen any one
but i feel it in my senses
i hear somebody comin'a step on our trailall the timenight in particular
reckon there's a big posse after us  wal if i see or hear anythin' i'll knock the girl on the head an' we'll dig out of hyar replied anson sullenly
wilson executed a swift forward motion violent and passionate so utterly unlike what might have been looked for from him that the three outlaws gaped
then you'll shore hev to knock jim wilson on the haid first he said in voice as strange as his action
jim
you wouldn't go back on me implored anson with uplifted hands in a dignity of pathos
i'm losin' my haid too an' you shore might as well knock it in an' you'll hev to before i'll stand you murderin' thet pore little gurl you've drove crazy  jim i was only mad replied anson
fer thet matter i'm growin' daffy myself
aw
we all need a good stiff drink of whisky  so he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension but he failed
his comrades did not rally to his help
wilson walked away nodding his head
boss let jim alone whispered shady
it's orful the way you buck ag'in' himwhen you seen he's stirred up
jim's true blue
but you gotta be careful  moze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods
when the cardplaying was resumed anson did not join the game and both moze and shady evinced little of that wholehearted obsession which usually attended their gambling
anson lay at length his head in a saddle scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept herself out of sight
at times a faint song or laugh very unnatural was wafted across the space
wilson plodded at the cooking and apparently heard no sounds
presently he called the men to eat which office they surlily and silently performed as if it was a favor bestowed upon the cook
snake hadn't i ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl asked wilson
do you hev to ask me thet snapped anson
she's gotta be fed if we hev to stuff it down her throat  wal i ain't stuck on the job replied wilson
but i'll tackle it seein' youall got cold feet  with plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little leanto and kneeling he put his head inside
the girl quickeyed and alert had evidently seen him coming
at any rate she greeted him with a cautious smile
jim was i pretty good she whispered
miss you was shore the finest aktress i ever seen he responded in a low voice
but you dam near overdid it
i'm goin' to tell anson you're sick nowpoisoned or somethin' awful
then we'll wait till night
dale shore will help us out  oh i'm on fire to get away she exclaimed
jim wilson i'll never forget you as long as i live  he seemed greatly embarrassed
walmissii'll do my best licks
but i ain't gamblin' none on results
be patient
keep your nerve
don't get scared
i reckon between me an' dale you'll git away from heah  withdrawing his head he got up and returned to the campfire where anson was waiting curiously
i left the grub
but she didn't touch it
seems sort of sick to me like she was poisoned  jim didn't i hear you talkin' asked anson
shore
i was coaxin' her
reckon she ain't so ranty as she was
but she shore is doubledup an' sickish  wuss an' wuss all the time said anson between his teeth
an' where's burt
hyar it's noon an' he left early
he never was no woodsman
he's got lost  either thet or he's run into somethin' replied wilson thoughtfully
anson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breaththe reaction of a man whose accomplices and partners and tools whose luck whose faith in himself had failed him
he flung himself down under a tree and after a while when his rigidity relaxed he probably fell asleep
moze and shady kept at their game
wilson paced to and fro sat down and then got up to bunch the horses again walked around the dell and back to camp
the afternoon hours were long
and they were waiting hours
the act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did
at sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague thick twilight
anson rolled over yawned and sat up
as he glanced around evidently seeking burt his face clouded
no sign of burt he asked
wilson expressed a mild surprise
wal snake you ain't expectin' burt now  i am course i am
why not demanded anson
any other time we'd look fer him wouldn't we  any other time ain't now burt won't ever come back wilson spoke it with a positive finality
ahuh
some more of them queer feelin's of yournoperatin' again hey
them onnatural kind thet you can't explain hey  anson's queries were bitter and rancorous
yes
an' snake i tax you with this heah
ain't any of them queer feelin's operatin' in you  no rolled out the leader savagely
but his passionate denial was a proof that he lied
from the moment of this outburst which was a fierce clinging to the old brave instincts of his character unless a sudden change marked the nature of his fortunes he would rapidly deteriorate to the breakingpoint
and in such brutal unrestrained natures as his this breakingpoint meant a desperate stand a desperate forcing of events a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal and to meet disaster and blood and death
wilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit
no one asked him to cook
no one made any effort to do so
one by one each man went to the pack to get some bread and meat
then they waited as men who knew not what they waited for yet hated and dreaded it
twilight in that glen was naturally a strange veiled condition of the atmosphere
it was a merging of shade and light which two seemed to make gray creeping shadows
suddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men
somethin' scared the hosses said anson rising
come on  moze accompanied him and they disappeared in the gloom
more trampling of hoofs was heard then a cracking of brush and the deep voices of men
at length the two outlaws returned leading three of the horses which they haltered in the open glen
the campfire light showed anson's face dark and serious
jim them hosses are wilder 'n deer he said
i ketched mine an' moze got two
but the rest worked away whenever we come close
some varmint has scared them bad
we all gotta rustle out thar quick  wilson rose shaking his head doubtfully
and at that moment the quiet air split to a piercing horrid neigh of a terrified horse
prolonged to a screech it broke and ended
then followed snorts of fright pound and crack and thud of hoofs and crash of brush then a gathering thumping crashing roar split by piercing sounds
stampede yelled anson and he ran to hold his own horse which he had haltered right in camp
it was big and wildlooking and now reared and plunged to break away
anson just got there in time and then it took all his weight to pull the horse down
not until the crashing snorting pounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did anson dare leave his frightened favorite
gone
our horses are gone
did you hear 'em he exclaimed blankly
shore
they're a cutup an' crippled bunch by now replied wilson
boss we'll never git 'ern back not 'n a hundred years declared moze
thet settles us snake anson stridently added shady jones
them hosses are gone
you can kiss your hand to them
they wasn't hobbled
they hed an orful scare
they split on thet stampede an' they'll never git together
 see what you've fetched us to  under the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to his seat staggered and silenced
in fact silence fell upon all the men and likewise enfolded the glen
night set in jetblack dismal lonely without a star
faintly the wind moaned
weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in the sound that was hollow
it was never the samea rumble as if faint distant thundera deep gurgle as of water drawn into a vortexa rolling as of a stone in swift current
the black cliff was invisible yet seemed to have many weird faces the giant pines loomed spectral the shadows were thick moving changing
flickering lights from the campfire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the brooding men
this campfire did not burn or blaze cheerily it had no glow no sputter no white heart no red living embers
one by one the outlaws as if with common consent tried their hands at making the fire burn aright
what little wood had been collected was old it would burn up with false flare only to die quickly
after a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred
not one smoked
their gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire
each one was concerned with his own thoughts his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of the future
that brooding hour severed him from comrade
at night nothing seemed the same as it was by day
with success and plenty with fullblooded action past and more in store these outlaws were as different from their present state as this black night was different from the bright day they waited for
wilson though he played a deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girland thus did not have haunting and superstitious fears on her accountwas probably more conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them
the evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature out of the darkness and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears
fear was their predominating sense
for years they had lived with some species of fearof honest men or vengeance of pursuit of starvation of lack of drink or gold of blood and death of stronger men of luck of chance of fate of mysterious nameless force
wilson was the type of fearless spirit but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of allthat of himselfthat he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his manhood
so they hunched around the campfire brooding because hope was at lowest ebb listening because the weird black silence with its moan of wind and hollow laugh of brook compelled them to hear waiting for sleep for the hours to pass for whatever was to come
and it was anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom
chapter xxiii  listen  anson whispered tensely
his poise was motionless his eyes roved everywhere
he held up a shaking bludgy finger to command silence
a third and stranger sound accompanied the low weird moan of the wind and the hollow mockery of the brookand it seemed a barely perceptible exquisitely delicate wail or whine
it filled in the lulls between the other sounds
if thet's some varmint he's close whispered anson
but shore it's far off said wilson
shady jones and moze divided their opinions in the same way
all breathed freer when the wail ceased relaxing to their former lounging positions around the fire
an impenetrable wall of blackness circled the pale space lighted by the campfire and this circle contained the dark somber group of men in the center the dying campfire and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on the outer edge
the horses scarcely moved from their tracks and their erect alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities of the night
then at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a wailing whine
it's thet crazy wench cryin' declared the outlaw leader
apparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as they had expressed for the termination of the sound
shore thet must be it agreed jim wilson gravely
we'll git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin' all night growled shady jones
she gives me the creeps said moze
wilson got up to resume his pondering walk head bent hands behind his back a grim realistic figure of perturbation
jimset down
you make me nervous said anson irritably
wilson actually laughed but low as if to keep his strange mirth well confined
snake i'll bet you my hoss an' my gun ag'in' a biscuit thet in aboot six seconds more or less i'll be stampedin like them hosses  anson's lean jaw dropped
the other two outlaws stared with round eyes
wilson was not drunk they evidently knew but what he really was appeared a mystery
jim wilson are you showin' yellow queried anson hoarsely
mebbe
the lord only knows
but listen heah snake you've seen an' heard people croak  you mean cash indie  shore  wal yesa couple or so replied anson grimly
but you never seen no one die of shockof an orful scare  no i reckon i never did  i have
an' thet's what's ailin' jim wilson and he resumed his dogged steps
anson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one another
ahuh
say what's thet got to do with us hyar
asked anson presently
thet gurl is dyin' retorted wilson in a voice cracking like a whip
the three outlaws stiffened in their seats incredulous yet irresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark lonely illomened hour
wilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle muttering to himself and came back again then he trudged farther this time almost out of sight but only to return the third time he vanished in the impenetrable wall of light
the three men scarcely moved a muscle as they watched the place where he had disappeared
in a few moments he came stumbling back
shore she's almost gone he said dismally
it took my nerve but i felt of her face thet orful wail is her breath chokin' in her throat like a deathrattle only long instead of short  wal if she's gotta croak it's good she gits it over quick replied anson
i 'ain't hed sleep fer three nights
 an' what i need is whisky  snake thet's gospel you're spoutin' remarked shady jones morosely
the direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of but any man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that the difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by different distances and positions
also when it was loudest it was most like a whine
but these outlaws heard with their consciences
at last it ceased abruptly
wilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night
his absence was longer than usual but he returned hurriedly
she's daid he exclaimed solemnly
thet innocent kidwho never harmed no onean' who'd make any man better fer seein' hershe's daid
anson you've shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes  what's eatin' you demanded the leader angrily
her blood ain't on my hands  it shore is shouted wilson shaking his hand at anson
an' you'll hev to take your medicine
i felt thet comin' all along
an' i feel some more  aw
she's jest gone to sleep declared anson shaking his long frame as he rose
gimme a light  boss you're plumb off to go near a dead gurl thet's jest died crazy  protested shady jones
off
haw
haw
who ain't off in this outfit i'd like to know anson possessed himself of a stick blazing at one and and with this he stalked off toward the leanto where the girl was supposed to be dead
his gaunt figure lighted by the torch certainly fitted the weird black surroundings
and it was seen that once near the girl's shelter he proceeded more slowly until he halted
he bent to peer inside
she's gone he yelled in harsh shaken accents
than the torch burned out leaving only a red glow
he whirled it about but the blaze did not rekindle
his comrades peering intently lost sight of his tall form and the end of the redended stick
darkness like pitch swallowed him
for a moment no sound intervened
again the moan of wind the strange little mocking hollow roar dominated the place
then there came a rush of something perhaps of air like the soft swishing of spruce branches swinging aside
dull thudding footsteps followed it
anson came running back to the fire
his aspect was wild his face pale his eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets
he had drawn his gun
didyesee er hearanythin' he panted peering back then all around and at last at his man
no
an' i shore was lookin' an' listenin' replied wilson
boss there wasn't nothin' declared moze
i ain't so sartin said shady jones with doubtful staring eyes
i believe i heerd a rustlin'  she wasn't there ejaculated anson in wondering awe
she's gone
my torch went out
i couldn't see
an' jest then i felt somethin' was passin'
fast
i jerked 'round
all was black an' yet if i didn't see a big gray streak i'm crazier 'n thet gurl
but i couldn't swear to anythin' but a rushin' of wind
i felt thet  gone exclaimed wilson in great alarm
fellars if thet's so then mebbe she wasn't daid an' she wandered off

but she was daid
her heart hed quit beatin'
i'll swear to thet  i move to break camp said shady jones gruffly and he stood up
moze seconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage
jim if she's deadan' gonewhat 'n hell's come off huskily asked anson
it only seems thet way
we're all worked up let's talk sense  anson shore there's a heap you an' me don't know replied wilson
the world come to an end once
wal it can come to another end
i tell you i ain't surprised  thar cried anson whirling with his gun leaping out
something huge shadowy gray against the black rushed behind the men and trees and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air
shore snake there wasn't nothin' said wilson presently  i heerd whispered shady jones
it was only a breeze blowin' thet smoke rejoined moze
i'd bet my soul somethin' went back of me declared anson glaring into the void
listen an' let's make shore suggested wilson
the guilty agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the flickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow
like statues they stood watching and listening
few sounds stirred in the strange silence
now and then the horses heaved heavily but stood still a dismal dreary note of the wind in the pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook
and these low sounds only fastened attention upon the quality of the silence
a breathing lonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell
like a pit of unplumbed depths the dark night yawned
an evil conscience listening there could have heard the most peaceful beautiful and mournful sounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell
suddenly the silent oppressive surcharged air split to a short piercing scream
anson's big horse stood up straight pawing the air and came down with a crash
the other horses shook with terror
wasn'ttheta cougar whispered anson thickly
thet was a woman's scream replied wilson and he appeared to be shaking like a leaf in the wind
theni figgered rightthe kid's alivewonderin' aroundan' she let out thet orful scream said anson
wonderin' 'round yesbut she's daid  my gawd
it ain't possible  wal if she ain't wonderin' round daid she's almost daid replied wilson
and he began to whisper to himself
if i'd only knowed what thet deal meant i'd hev plugged beasley instead of listenin' an' i ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an' made sartin she'd croaked
if she goes screamin' 'round thet way  his voice failed as there rose a thin splitting highpointed shriek somewhat resembling the first scream only less wild
it came apparently from the cliff
from another point in the pitchblack glen rose the wailing terrible cry of a woman in agony
wild haunting mournful wail
anson's horse loosing the halter plunged back almost falling over a slight depression in the rocky ground
the outlaw caught him and dragged him nearer the fire
the other horses stood shaking and straining
moze ran between them and held them
shady jones threw green brush on the fire
with sputter and crackle a blaze started showing wilson standing tragically his arms out facing the black shadows
the strange live shriek was not repeated
but the cry like that of a woman in her deaththroes pierced the silence again
it left a quivering ring that softly died away
then the stillness clamped down once more and the darkness seemed to thicken
the men waited and when they had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close right behind the trees
it was humanthe personification of pain and terrorthe tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death
so pure so exquisite so wonderful was the cry that the listeners writhed as if they saw an innocent tender beautiful girl torn frightfully before their eyes
it was full of suspense it thrilled for death its marvelous potency was the wild notethat beautiful and ghastly note of selfpreservation
in sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall whence the cry came
then he had to fight his horse to keep him from plunging away
following the shot was an interval of silence the horses became tractable the men gathered closer to the fire with the halters still held firmly
if it was a cougarthet 'd scare him off said anson
shore but it ain't a cougar replied wilson
wait an' see  they all waited listening with ears turned to different points eyes roving everywhere afraid of their very shadows
once more the moan of wind the mockery of brook deep gurgle laugh and babble dominated the silence of the glen
boss let's shake this spooky hole whispered moze
the suggestion attracted anson and he pondered it while slowly shaking his head
we've only three hosses
an' mine 'll take ridin'after them squalls  replied the leader
we've got packs too
an' hell 'ain't nothin' on this place fer bein' dark  no matter
let's go
i'll walk an' lead the way said moze eagerly
i got sharp eyes
you fellars can ride an' carry a pack
we'll git out of here an' come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit  anson i'm keen fer thet myself declared shady jones
jim what d'ye say to thet queried anson
rustlin' out of this black hole  shore it's a grand idee agreed wilson
thet was a cougar avowed anson gathering courage as the silence remained unbroken
but jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed been a woman screamin' over a blade twistin' in her gizzards  snake shore you seen a woman heah lately deliberately asked wilson
reckon i did
thet kid replied anson dubiously
wal you seen her go crazy didn't you  yes  'an' she wasn't heah when you went huntin' fer her  correct  wal if thet's so what do you want to blab about cougars for  wilson's argument seemed incontestable
shady and moze nodded gloomily and shifted restlessly from foot to foot
anson dropped his head
no matterif we only don't hear he began suddenly to grow mute
right upon them from some place just out the circle of light rose a scream by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet heard simply petrifying the group until the peal passed
anson's huge horse reared and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap straight out
he struck anson with thudding impact knocking him over the rocks into the depression back of the campfire and plunging after him
wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck and he turned to see anson go down
there came a crash a groan and then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up
apparently he had rolled over his master
help fellars yelled wilson quick to leap down over the little bank and in the dim light to grasp the halter
the three men dragged the horse out and securely tied him close to a tree
that done they peered down into the depression
anson's form could just barely be distinguished in the gloom
he lay stretched out
another groan escaped him
shore i'm scared he's hurt said wilson
hoss rolled right on top of him
an' thet hoss's heavy declared moze
they got down and knelt beside their leader
in the darkness his face looked dull gray
his breathing was not right
snake old man you ain'thurt asked wilson with a tremor in his voice
receiving no reply he said to his comrades lay hold an' we'll heft him up where we can see  the three men carefully lifted anson up on the bank and laid him near the fire in the light
anson was conscious
his face was ghastly
blood showed on his lips
wilson knelt beside him
the other outlaws stood up and with one dark gaze at one another damned anson's chance of life
and on the instant rose that terrible distressing scream of acute agonylike that of a woman being dismembered
shady jones whispered something to moze
then they stood up gazing down at their fallen leader
tell me where you're hurt asked wilson
hesmashedmy chest said anson in a broken strangled whisper
wilson's deft hands opened the outlaw's shirt and felt of his chest
no
shore your breastbone ain't smashed replied wilson hopefully
and he began to run his hand around one side of anson's body and then the other
abruptly he stopped averted his gaze then slowly ran the hand all along that side
anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in by the weight of the horse
he was bleeding at the mouth and his slow painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth which showed that the broken bones had penetrated the lungs
an injury sooner or later fatal
pard you busted a rib or two said wilson
aw jimit must bewuss 'n thet he whispered
i'min orfulpain
an' i can'tgit anybreath  mebbe you'll be better said wilson with a cheerfulness his face belied
moze bent close over anson took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face at the bloodstained lips and the lean hands plucking at nothing
then he jerked erect
shady he's goin' to cash
let's clear out of this  i'm yours pertickler previous replied jones
both turned away
they untied the two horses and led them up to where the saddles lay
swiftly the blankets went on swiftly the saddles swung up swiftly the cinches snapped
anson lay gazing up at wilson comprehending this move
and wilson stood strangely grim and silent somehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours
shady you grab some bread an' i'll pack a bunk of meat said moze
both men came near the fire into the light within ten feet of where the leader lay
fellarsyou ain'tslopin' he whispered in husky amaze
boss we air thet same
we can't do you no good an' this hole ain't healthy replied moze
shady jones swung himself astride his horse all about him sharp eager strung
moze i'll tote the grub an' you lead out of hyar till we git past the wust timber he said
aw mozeyou wouldn't leavejim hyaralone implored anson
jim can stay till he rots retorted moze
i've hed enough of this hole  but mozeit ain't square panted anson
jim wouldn'tleave me
i'd stickby you
i'll make itall up to you  snake you're goin' to cash sardonically returned moze
a current leaped all through anson's stretched frame
his ghastly face blazed
that was the great and the terrible moment which for long had been in abeyance
wilson had known grimly that it would come by one means or another
anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against the tide of fatal issues
moze and shady jones deep locked in their selfcentered motives had not realized the inevitable trend of their dark lives
anson prostrate as he was swiftly drew his gun and shot moze
without sound or movement of hand moze fell
then the plunge of shady's horse caused anson's second shot to miss
a quick third shot brought no apparent result but shady's cursing resort to his own weapon
he tried to aim from his plunging horse
his bullets spattered dust and gravel over anson
then wilson's long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged
shady collapsed in the saddle and the frightened horse throwing him plunged out of the circle of light
thudding hoofs crashings of brush quickly ceased
jimdid yougit him whispered anson
shore did snake was the slow halting response
jim wilson must have sustained a sick shudder as he replied
sheathing his gun he folded a blanket and put it under anson's head
jimmy feetair orful cold whispered anson
wal it's gittin' chilly replied wilson and taking a second blanket he laid that over anson's limbs
snake i'm feared shady hit you once  ahuh
but not so i'd caremuchif i hedno wuss hurt  you lay still now
reckon shady's hoss stopped out heah a ways
an' i'll see  jimi 'ain't heerdthet scream fera little  shore it's gone reckon now thet was a cougar  i knowed it  wilson stalked away into the darkness
that inky wall did not seem so impenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light
he proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps
he groped from tree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge flat rock as high as his head
here the darkness was blackest yet he was able to see a light form on the rock
miss are you thereall right he called softly
yes but i'm scared to death she whispered in reply
shore it wound up sudden
come now
i reckon your trouble's over  he helped her off the rock and finding her unsteady on her feet he supported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to feel for objects
foot by foot they worked out from under the dense shadow of the cliff following the course of the little brook
it babbled and gurgled and almost drowned the low whistle wilson sent out
the girl dragged heavily upon him now evidently weakening
at length he reached the little open patch at the head of the ravine
halting here he whistled
an answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right
wilson waited with the girl hanging on his arm
dale's heah he said
an' don't you keel over nowafter all the nerve you hed  a swishing of brush a step a soft padded footfall a looming dark figure and a long low gray shape stealthily movingit was the last of these that made wilson jump
wilson came dale's subdued voice
heah
i've got her dale
safe an sound replied wilson stepping toward the tall form
and he put the drooping girl into dale's arms
bo
bo
you're all right dale's deep voice was tremulous
she roused up to seize him and to utter little cries of joy  oh dale
oh thank heaven
i'm ready to drop now

the girl's face flashed white in the gloom
she pressed against the outlawwrung his hands
heaven help you jim wilson
you are from texas
i'll remember youpray for you all my life  wilson moved away out toward the pale glow of light under the black pines
chapter xxiv  as helen rayner watched dale ride away on a quest perilous to him and which meant almost life or death for her it was surpassing strange that she could think of nothing except the thrilling tumultuous moment when she had put her arms round his neck
it did not matter that dalesplendid fellow that he washad made the ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken itthe fact that she had actually done it was enough
how utterly impossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them once they were acted upon
confounding realization then was that when dale returned with her sister helen knew she would do the same thing over again
if i doi won't be twofaced about it she soliloquized and a hot blush flamed her cheeks
she watched dale until he rode out of sight
when he had gone worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion
she turned to the business of meeting events
before supper she packed her valuables and books papers and clothes together with bo's and had them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she would have her personal possessions
the mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their tarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranchhouse that night so that helen at least would not be surprised
but the day came with its manifold duties undisturbed by any event
and it passed slowly with the leaden feet of listening watching vigilance
carmichael did not come back nor was there news of him to be had
the last known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day when a sheepherder had seen him far out on the north range headed for the hills
the beemans reported that roy's condition had improved and also that there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village
this second lonely night was almost unendurable for helen
when she slept it was to dream horrible dreams when she lay awake it was to have her heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window and to be in torture of imagination as to poor bo's plight
a thousand times helen said to herself that beasley could have had the ranch and welcome if only bo had been spared
helen absolutely connected her enemy with her sister's disappearance
riggs might have been a means to it
daylight was not attended by so many fears there were things to do that demanded attention
and thus it was that the next morning shortly before noon she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at the corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near
from the window she saw a big smoke
fire
that must be one of the barnsthe old one farthest out  she said gazing out of the window
some careless mexican with his everlasting cigarette  helen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened
she had decided to stay in the house
but when footsteps sounded on the porch and a rap on the door she unhesitatingly opened it
four mexicans stood close
one of them quick as thought flashed a hand in to grasp her and in a single motion pulled her across the threshold
no hurt senora he said and pointedmaking motions she must go
helen did not need to be told what this visit meant
many as her conjectures had been however she had not thought of beasley subjecting her to this outrage
and her blood boiled
how dare you she said trembling in her effort to control her temper
but class authority voice availed nothing with these swarthy mexicans
they grinned
another laid hold of helen with dirty brown hand
she shrank from the contact
let go she burst out furiously
and instinctively she began to struggle to free herself
then they all took hold of her
helen's dignity might never have been
a burning choking rush of blood was her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her inheritance from the auchinclosses
she who had resolved never to lay herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress
the mexicans jabbering in their excitement had all they could do until they lifted her bodily from the porch
they handled her as if she had been a halfempty sack of corn
one holding each hand and foot they packed her with dress disarranged and half torn off down the path to the lane and down the lane to the road
there they stood upright and pushed her off her property
through halfblind eyes helen saw them guarding the gateway ready to prevent her entrance
she staggered down the road to the village
it seemed she made her way through a red dimnessthat there was a congestion in her brainthat the distance to mrs cass's cottage was insurmountable
but she got there to stagger up the path to hear the old woman's cry
dizzy faint sick with a blackness enveloping all she looked at helen felt herself led into the sittingroom and placed in the big chair
presently sight and clearness of mind returned to her
she saw roy white as a sheet questioning her with terrible eyes
the old woman hung murmuring over her trying to comfort her as well as fasten the disordered dress
four greaserspacked me downthe hillthrew me off my ranchinto the road panted helen
she seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the mighty wave of danger that shook her whole body
if i'd knowni would have killed them  she exclaimed that fullvoiced and hard with dry hot eyes on her friends
roy reached out to take her hand speaking huskily
helen did not distinguish what he said
the frightened old woman knelt with unsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in helen's dress
the moment came when helen's quivering began to subside when her blood quieted to let her reason sway when she began to do battle with her rage and slowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a sleeping tigress in her veins
oh miss helen you looked so turrible i made sure you was hurted  the old woman was saying
helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists at the one stocking that hung down over her shoetop at the rent which had bared her shoulder to the profane gaze of those grinning beadyeyed mexicans
my body'snot hurt she whispered
roy had lost some of his whiteness and where his eyes had been fierce they were now kind
wal miss nell it's lucky no harm's done now if you'll only see this whole deal clear
not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin' an' hopin'
if you can only see what's raw in this westan' love it jest the same  helen only half divined his meaning but that was enough for a future reflection
the west was beautiful but hard
in the faces of these friends she began to see the meaning of the keen sloping lines and shadows of pain of a lean naked truth cut as from marble
for the land's sakes tell us all about it importuned mrs cass
whereupon helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her expulsion from her home
shore weall expected thet said roy
an' it's jest as well you're here with a whole skin
beasley's in possession now an' i reckon we'd all sooner hev you away from thet ranch  but roy i won't let beasley stay there cried helen
miss nell shore by the time this here pine has growed big enough fer law you'll hev gray in thet pretty hair
you can't put beasley off with your honest an' rightful claim
al auchincloss was a hard driver
he made enemies an' he made some he didn't kill
the evil men do lives after them
an' you've got to suffer fer al's sins though al was as good as any man who ever prospered in these parts  oh what can i do
i won't give up
i've been robbed
can't the people help me
must i meekly sit with my hands crossed while that halfbreed thiefoh it's unbelievable  i reckon you'll jest hev to be patient fer a few days said roy calmly
it'll all come right in the end  roy
you've had this deal as you call it all worked out in mind for a long time exclaimed helen
shore an' i 'ain't missed a reckonin' yet  then what will happenin a few days  nell rayner are you goin' to hev some spunk an' not lose your nerve again or go wild out of your head  i'll try to be brave butbut i must be prepared she replied tremulously
wal there's dale an' las vegas an' me fer beasley to reckon with
an' miss nell his chances fer long life are as pore as his chances fer heaven  but roy i don't believe in deliberate taking of life replied helen shuddering
that's against my religion
i won't allow it andthenthink dale all of youin danger  girl how 're you ever goin' to help yourself
shore you might hold dale back if you love him an' swear you won't give yourself to him an' i reckon i'd respect your religion if you was goin' to suffer through me
but not dale nor younor bonor love or heaven or hell can ever stop thet cowboy las vegas  oh if dale brings bo back to mewhat will i care for my ranch  murmured helen
reckon you'll only begin to care when thet happens
your big hunter has got to be put to work replied roy with his keen smile
before noon that day the baggage helen had packed at home was left on the porch of widow cass's cottage and helen's anxious need of the hour was satisfied
she was made comfortable in the old woman's one spare room and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance
to her surprise many of mrs cass's neighbors came unobtrusively to the back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries
they appeared a subdued and apprehensive group and whispered to one another as they left
helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the wives of the men dominated by beasley believed no good could come of this highhanded taking over of the ranch
indeed helen found at the end of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune
the next day roy informed her that his brother john had come down the preceding night with the news of beasley's descent upon the ranch
not a shot had been fired and the only damage done was that of the burning of a hayfilled barn
this had been set on fire to attract helen's men to one spot where beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their number
he had boldly ordered them off the land unless they wanted to acknowledge him boss and remain there in his service
the three beemans had stayed having planned that just in this event they might be valuable to helen's interests
beasley had ridden down into pine the same as upon any other day
roy reported also news which had come in that morning how beasley's crowd had celebrated late the night before
the second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away and helen believed they had made her old
at night she lay awake most of the time thinking and praying but during the afternoon she got some sleep
she could think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister and dale's chances of saving her
well shore you pay dale a pore compliment finally protested the patient roy
i tell youmilt dale can do anythin' he wants to do in the woods
you can believe thet

but i reckon he'll run chances after he comes back  this significant speech thrilled helen with its assurance of hope and made her blood curdle at the implied peril awaiting the hunter
on the afternoon of the fifth day helen was abruptly awakened from her nap
the sun had almost set
she heard voicesthe shrill cackling notes of old mrs cass high in excitement a deep voice that made helen tingle all over a girl's laugh broken but happy
there were footsteps and stamping of hoofs
dale had brought bo back
helen knew it
she grew very weak and had to force herself to stand erect
her heart began to pound in her very ears
a sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her soul
she thanked god her prayers had been answered
then suddenly alive with sheer mad physical gladness she rushed out
she was just in time to see roy beeman stalk out as if he had never been shot and with a yell greet a big grayclad grayfaced mandale
howdy roy
glad to see you up said dale
how the quiet voice steadied helen
she beheld bo
bo looking the same except a little pale and disheveled
then bo saw her and leaped at her into her arms
nell
i'm here
safeall right
never was so happy in my life ohh
talk about your adventures
nell you dear old mother to mei've had eenough forever  bo was wild with joy and by turns she laughed and cried
but helen could not voice her feelings
her eyes were so dim that she could scarcely see dale when he loomed over her as she held bo
but he found the hand she put shakily out
nell
reckon it's been harderon you his voice was earnest and halting
she felt his searching gaze upon her face
mrs
cass said you were here
an' i know why  roy led them all indoors
milt one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss he said as dale turned toward the dusty and weary ranger
where'd you leave the cougar  i sent him home replied date
laws now milt if this ain't grand cackled mrs cass
we've worried some here
an' miss helen near starved ahopin' fer you  mother i reckon the girl an' i are nearer starved than anybody you know replied dale with a grim laugh
fer the land's sake
i'll be fixin' supper this minit  nell why are you here asked bo suspiciously
for answer helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door
bo saw the baggage
her expression changed
the old blaze leaped to the telltale eyes
he's done it she cried hotly
dearestthank god
i've got youback again murmured helen finding her voice
nothing else matters
i've prayed only for that  good old nell whispered bo and she kissed and embraced helen
you really mean that i know
but nix for yours truly
i'm back alive and kicking you bet where's mywhere's tom  bo not a word has been heard of him for five days
he's searching for you of course  and you've beenbeen put off the ranch  well rather replied helen and in a few trembling words she told the story of her eviction
bo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance but it became her passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister
oh
does tom carmichael know this she added breathlessly
how could he  when he finds out thenoh won't there be hell
i'm glad i got here first nell my boots haven't been off the whole blessed time
help me
and oh for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes
nell old girl i wasn't raised right for these western deals
too luxurious  and then helen had her ears filled with a rapidfire account of running horses and riggs and outlaws and beasley called boldly to his teeth and a long ride and an outlaw who was a heroa fight with riggsblood and deathanother long ridea wild camp in black woodsnightlonely ghostly soundsand day againplota great actress lost to the worldopheliasnakes and ansonshoodooed outlawsmournful moans and terrible criescougarstampedefight and shots more blood and deathwilson heroanother tom carmichaelfallen in love with outlaw gunfighter ifblack night and dale and horse and rides and starved and oh nell he was from texas  helen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over the bright head of this beloved little sister but the bewilderment occasioned by bo's fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last sentence clear
presently helen got a word in to inform bo that mrs cass had knocked twice for supper and that welcome news checked bo's flow of speech when nothing else seemed adequate
it was obvious to helen that roy and dale had exchanged stories
roy celebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he had been shot and despite helen's misfortune and the suspended waiting balance in the air the occasion was joyous
old mrs cass was in the height of her glory
she sensed a romance here and true to her sex she radiated to it
daylight was still lingering when roy got up and went out on the porch
his keen ears had heard something
helen fancied she herself had heard rapid hoofbeats
dale come out called roy sharply
the hunter moved with his swift noiseless agility
helen and bo followed halting in the door
thet's las vegas whispered dale
to helen it seemed that the cowboy's name changed the very atmosphere
voices were heard at the gate one that harsh and quick sounded like carmichael's
and a spirited horse was pounding and scattering gravel
then a lithe figure appeared striding up the path
it was carmichaelyet not the carmichael helen knew
she heard bo's strange little cry a corroboration of her own impression
roy might never have been shot judging from the way he stepped out and dale was almost as quick
carmichael reached themgrasped them with swift hard hands
boysi jest rode in
an' they said you'd found her  shore las vegas
dale fetched her home safe an' sound
there she is  the cowboy thrust aside the two men and with a long stride he faced the porch his piercing eyes on the door
all that helen could think of his look was that it seemed terrible
bo stepped outside in front of helen
probably she would have run straight into carmichael's arms if some strange instinct had not withheld her
helen judged it to be fear she found her heart lifting painfully
bo he yelled like a savage yet he did not in the least resemble one
ohtom cried bo falteringly
she half held out her arms
you girl that seemed to be his piercing query like the quivering blade in his eyes
two more long strides carried him close up to her and his look chased the red out of bo's cheek
then it was beautiful to see his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered las vegas magnified in all his old spirit
aw the exclamation was a tremendous sigh
i shore am glad  that beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men
he wrung dale's hand long and hard and his gaze confused the older man
riggs he said and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the word disappeared the strange fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion
wilson killed him replied dale
jim wilsonthat old texas ranger
reckon he lent you a hand  my friend he saved bo replied dale with emotion
my old cougar an' mewe just hung 'round  you made wilson help you cut in the hard voice
yes
but he killed riggs before i come up an' i reckon he'd done well by bo if i'd never got there  how about the gang  all snuffed out i reckon except wilson  somebody told me beasley hed ran miss helen off the ranch
thet so  yes
four of his greasers packed her down the hillmost tore her clothes off so roy tells me  four greasers
shore it was beasley's deal clean through  yes
riggs was led
he had an itch for a bad name you know
but beasley made the plan
it was nell they wanted instead of bo  abruptly carmichael stalked off down the darkening path his silver heelplates ringing his spurs jingling
hold on carmichael called dale taking a step
oh tom cried bo
shore folks callin' won't be no use if anythin would be said roy
las vegas has hed a look at red liquor  he's been drinking
oh that accounts
he nevernever even touched me  for once helen was not ready to comfort bo
a mighty tug at her heart had sent her with flying uneven steps toward dale
he took another stride down the path and another
daleohplease stop she called very low
he halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path
when he turned helen had come close
twilight was deep there in the shade of the peachtrees but she could see his face the hungry flaring eyes
ii haven't thanked youyetfor bringing bo home she whispered
nell never mind that he said in surprise
if you mustwhy wait
i've got to catch up with that cowboy  no
let me thank you now she whispered and stepping closer she put her arms up meaning to put them round his neck
that action must be her selfpunishment for the other time she had done it
yet it might also serve to thank him
but strangely her hands got no farther than his breast and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin jacket
she felt a heave of his deep chest
ii do thank youwith all my heart she said softly
i owe you nowfor myself and hermore than i can ever repay  nell i'm your friend he replied hurriedly
don't talk of repayin' me
let me go nowafter las vegas  what for she queried suddenly
i mean to line up beside himat the baror wherever he goes  returned dale
don't tell me that
i know
you're going straight to meet beasley  nell if you hold me up any longer i reckon i'll have to runor never get to beasley before that cowboy  helen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacketleaned closer to him all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her
i'll not let you go she said
he laughed and put his great hands over hers
what 're you sayin' girl
you can't stop me  yes i can
dale i don't want you to risk your life  he stared at her and made as if to tear her hands from their hold
listenpleaseohplease she implored
if you go deliberately to kill beasleyand do itthat will be murder
it's against my religion
i would be unhappy all my life  but child you'll be ruined all your life if beasley is not dealt withas men of his breed are always dealt with in the west he remonstrated and in one quick move he had freed himself from her clutching fingers
helen with a move as swift put her arms round his neck and clasped her hands tight
milt i'm finding myself she said
the other day when i didthisyou made an excuse for me
i'm not twofaced now  she meant to keep him from killing beasley if she sacrificed every last shred of her pride
and she stamped the look of his face on her heart of hearts to treasure always
the thrill the beat of her pulses almost obstructed her thought of purpose
nell just nowwhen you're overcomerash with feelin'sdon't say to mea worda  he broke down huskily
my first friendmyoh dale i know you love me
she whispered
and she hid her face on his breast there to feel a tremendous tumult
oh don't you she cried in low smothered voice as his silence drove her farther on this mad yet glorious purpose
if you need to be toldyesi reckon i do love you nell rayner he replied
it seemed to helen that he spoke from far off
she lifted her face her heart on her lips
if you kill beasley i'll never marry you she said
who's expectin' you to he asked with low hoarse laugh
do you think you have to marry me to square accounts
this's the only time you ever hurt me nell rayner
i'm 'shamed you could think i'd expect youout of gratitude  ohyouyou are as dense as the forest where you live she cried
and then she shut her eyes again the better to remember that transfiguration of his face the better to betray herself
mani love you full and deep yet tremulous the words burst from her heart that had been burdened with them for many a day
then it seemed in the throbbing riot of her senses that she was lifted and swung into his arms and handled with a great and terrible tenderness and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a bear and held with her feet off the ground and rendered blind dizzy rapturous and frightened and utterly torn asunder from her old calm thinking self
he put her downreleased her
nothin' could have made me so happy as what you said he finished with a strong sigh of unutterable wondering joy
then you will not go toto meet  helen's happy query froze on her lips
i've got to go he rejoined with his old quiet voice
hurry in to bo an' don't worry
try to think of things as i taught you up in the woods  helen heard his soft padded footfalls swiftly pass away
she was left there alone in the darkening twilight suddenly cold and stricken as if turned to stone
thus she stood an agelong moment until the upflashing truth galvanized her into action
then she flew in pursuit of dale
the truth was that in spite of dale's' early training in the east and the long years of solitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling he had also become a part of this raw bold and violent west
it was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw dale's tall dark form against the yellow light of turner's saloon
somehow in that poignant moment when her flying feet kept pace with her heart helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this raw primitive justice of the west
she was one of the first influences emanating from civilized life from law and order
in that flash of truth she saw the west as it would be some future time when through women and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever
also just as clearly she saw the present need of men like roy beeman and dale and the fireblooded carmichael
beasley and his kind must be killed
but helen did not want her lover her future husband and the probable father of her children to commit what she held to be murder
at the door of the saloon she caught up with dale
miltohwait'
wait she panted
she heard him curse under his breath as he turned
they were alone in the yellow flare of light
horses were champing bits and drooping before the rails
you go back ordered dale sternly
his face was pale his eyes were gleaming
no
not tillyou take meor carry me she replied resolutely with all a woman's positive and inevitable assurance
then he laid hold of her with ungentle hands
his violence especially the look on his face terrified helen rendered her weak
but nothing could have shaken her resolve
she felt victory
her sex her love and her presence would be too much for dale
as he swung helen around the low hum of voices inside the saloon suddenly rose to sharp hoarse roars accompanied by a scuffling of feet and crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables
dale let go of helen and leaped toward the door
but a silence inside quicker and stranger than the roar halted him
helen's heart contracted then seemed to cease beating
there was absolutely not a perceptible sound
even the horses appeared like dale to have turned to statues
two thundering shots annihilated this silence
then quickly came a lighter shotthe smash of glass
dale ran into the saloon
the horses began to snort to rear to pound
a low muffled murmur terrified helen even as it drew her
dashing at the door she swung it in and entered
the place was dim bluehazed smelling of smoke
dale stood just inside the door
on the floor lay two men
chairs and tables were overturned
a motley dark shirtsleeved booted and belted crowd of men appeared hunched against the opposite wall with pale set faces turned to the bar
turner the proprietor stood at one end his face livid his hands aloft and shaking
carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar
he held a gun low down
it was smoking
with a gasp helen flashed her eyes back to dale
he had seen herwas reaching an arm toward her
then she saw the man lying almost at her feet
jeff mulveyher uncle's old foreman
his face was awful to behold
a smoking gun lay near his inert hand
the other man had fallen on his face
his garb proclaimed him a mexican
he was not yet dead
then helen as she felt dale's arm encircle her looked farther because she could not prevent itlooked on at that strange figure against the barthis boy who had been such a friend in her hour of needthis naive and frank sweetheart of her sister's
she saw a man nowwild white intense as fire with some terrible cool kind of deadliness in his mien
his left elbow rested upon the bar and his hand held a glass of red liquor
the big gun low down in his other hand seemed as steady as if it were a fixture
heah's to thethalfbreed beasley an' his outfit  carmichael drank while his flaming eyes held the crowd then with savage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering form of the still living mexican on the floor
helen felt herself slipping
all seemed to darken around her
she could not see dale though she knew he held her
then she fainted
chapter xxv  las vegas carmichael was a product of his day
the pan handle of texas the old chisholm trail along which were driven the great cattle herds northward fort dodge where the cowboys conflicted with the cardsharpsthese hard places had left their marks on carmichael
to come from texas was to come from fighting stock
and a cowboy's life was strenuous wild violent and generally brief
the exceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns and they drifted from south to north and west taking with them the reckless chivalrous vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed
the pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the west habitable had it not been for these wild cowboys these harddrinking hardriding hardliving rangers of the barrens these easy cool laconic simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who possessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death
las vegas ran his horse from widow cass's cottage to turner's saloon and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door
las vegas's entrance was a leap
then he stood still with the door ajar and the horse pounding and snorting back
all the men in that saloon who saw the entrance of las vegas knew what it portended
no thunderbolt could have more quickly checked the drinking gambling talking crowd
they recognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival
for a second the bluehazed room was perfectly quiet then men breathed moved rose and suddenly caused a quick sliding crash of chairs and tables
the cowboy's glittering eyes flashed to and fro and then fixed on mulvey and his mexican companion
that glance singled out these two and the sudden rush of nervous men proved it
mulvey and the sheepherder were left alone in the center of the floor
howdy jeff
where's your boss asked las vegas
his voice was cool friendly his manner was easy natural but the look of him was what made mulvey pale and the mexican livid
reckon he's home replied mulvey
home
what's he call home now  he's hangin' out hyar at auchincloss's replied mulvey
his voice was not strong but his eyes were steady watchful
las vegas quivered all over as if stung
a flame that seemed white and red gave his face a singular hue
jeff you worked for old al a long time an' i've heard of your differences said las vegas
thet ain't no mix of mine
but you doublecrossed miss helen  mulvey made no attempt to deny this
he gulped slowly
his hands appeared less steady and he grew paler
again las vegas's words signified less than his look
and that look now included the mexican
pedro you're one of beasley's old hands said las vegas accusingly
an'you was one of them four greasers thet  here the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material poison
the mexican showed his guilt and cowardice
he began to jabber
shet up hissed las vegas with a savage and significant jerk of his arm as if about to strike
but that action was read for its true meaning
pellmell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open space behind the three
las vegas waited
but mulvey seemed obstructed
the mexican looked dangerous through his fear
his fingers twitched as if the tendons running up into his arms were being pulled
an instant of suspensemore than long enough for mulvey to be tried and found wantingand las vegas with laugh and sneer turned his back upon the pair and stepped to the bar
his call for a bottle made turner jump and hold it out with shaking hands
las vegas poured out a drink while his gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar
this turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what kind of a school las vegas had been trained in
if those men had been worthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them
as it was when mulvey and the mexican jerked at their guns las vegas swiftly wheeled and shot twice
mulvey's gun went off as he fell and the mexican doubled up in a heap on the floor
then las vegas reached around with his left hand for the drink he had poured out
at this juncture dale burst into the saloon suddenly to check his impetus to swerve aside toward the bar and halt
the door had not ceased swinging when again it was propelled inward this time to admit helen rayner white and wideeyed
in another moment then las vegas had spoken his deadly toast to beasley's gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing mexican on the floor
also dale had gravitated toward the reeling helen to catch her when she fainted
las vegas began to curse and striding to dale he pushed him out of the saloon

what 're you doin' heah he yelled stridently
hevn't you got thet girl to think of
then do it you big indian
lettin' her run after you heahriskin' herself thet way
you take care of her an' bo an' leave this deal to me  the cowboy furious as he was at dale yet had keen swift eyes for the horses near at hand and the men out in the dim light
dale lifted the girl into his arms and turning without a word stalked away to disappear in the darkness
las vegas holding his gun low returned to the barroom
if there had been any change in the crowd it was slight
the tension had relaxed
turner no longer stood with hands up
youall go on with your fun called the cowboy with a sweep of his gun
but it'd be risky fer any one to start leavin'  with that he backed against the bar near where the black bottle stood
turner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs and presently the crowd with some caution and suspense resumed their games and drinking
it was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door
from time to time turner served liquor to men who called for it
las vegas leaned with back against the bar
after a while he sheathed his gun and reached around for the bottle
he drank with his piercing eyes upon the door
no one entered and no one went out
the games of chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed
it was a hard scenethat smoky long illsmelling room with its dim yellow lights and dark evil faces with the stealthystepping turner passing to and fro and the dead mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling and the mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently then lay still and with the drinking somber waiting cowboy more fiery and more flaming with every drink listening for a step that did not come
time passed and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy
drink affected him but he did not become drunk
it seemed that the liquor he drank was consumed by a mounting fire
it was fuel to a driving passion
he grew more sullen somber brooding redder of eye and face more crouching and restless
at last when the hour was so late that there was no probability of beasley appearing las vegas flung himself out of the saloon
all lights of the village had now been extinguished
the tired horses drooped in the darkness
las vegas found his horse and led him away down the road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in the starlight
morning was not far off
he unsaddled the horse and turning him loose went into the barn
here he seemed familiar with his surroundings for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft where he threw himself on the hay
he rested but did not sleep
at daylight he went down and brought his horse into the barn
sunrise found las vegas pacing to and fro the short length of the interior and peering out through wide cracks between the boards
then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched the occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the village
about the breakfast hour las vegas saddled his horse and rode back the way he had come the night before
at turner's he called for something to eat as well as for whisky
after that he became a listening watching machine
he drank freely for an hour then he stopped
he seemed to be drunk but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in drinking men
savage fierce sullen he was one to avoid
turner waited on him in evident fear
at length las vegas's condition became such that action was involuntary
he could not stand still nor sit down
stalking out he passed the store where men slouched back to avoid him and he went down the road wary and alert as if he expected a rifleshot from some hidden enemy
upon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person was to be seen
he went in to turner's
the proprietor was there at his post nervous and pale
las vegas did not order any more liquor
turner i reckon i'll bore you next time i run in heah he said and stalked out
he had the stores the road the village to himself and he patrolled a beat like a sentry watching for an indian attack
toward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the cowboy
las vegas i'm tellin' youall the greasers air leavin' the range he said
howdy abe replied las vegas
what 'n hell you talkin' about  the man repeated his information
and las vegas spat out frightful curses
abeyou heah what beasley's doin'  yes
he's with his menup at the ranch
reckon he can't put off ridin' down much longer  that was where the west spoke
beasley would be forced to meet the enemy who had come out singlehanded against him
long before this hour a braver man would have come to face las vegas
beasley could not hire any gang to bear the brunt of this situation
this was the test by which even his own men must judge him
all of which was to say that as the wildness of the west had made possible his crimes so it now held him responsible for them
abe if thetgreaser don't rustle down heah i'm goin' after him  sure
but don't be in no hurry replied abe
i'm waltzin' to slow music gimme a smoke  with fingers that slightly trembled abe rolled a cigarette lit it from his own and handed it to the cowboy
las vegas i reckon i hear hosses he said suddenly
me too replied las vegas with his head high like that of a listening deer
apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend
abe hurried back to the store where he disappeared
las vegas began his stalking up and down and his action now was an exaggeration of all his former movements
a rational ordinary mortal from some eastern community happening to meet this redfaced cowboy would have considered him drunk or crazy
probably las vegas looked both
but all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and efficient instrument to meet the portending issue
how many thousands of times on the trails and in the widestreeted little towns all over the west had this stalk of the cowboy's been perpetrated
violent bloody tragic as it was it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the use of a horse or the need of a plow
at length pine was apparently a deserted village except for las vegas who patrolled his long beat in many wayshe lounged while he watched he stalked like a mountaineer he stole along indian fashion stealthily from tree to tree from corner to corner he disappeared in the saloon to reappear at the back he slipped round behind the barns to come out again in the main road and time after time he approached his horse as if deciding to mount
the last visit he made into turner's saloon he found no one there
savagely he pounded on the bar with his gun
he got no response
then the longpentup rage burst
with wild whoops he pulled another gun and shot at the mirror the lamps
he shot the neck off a bottle and drank till he choked his neck corded bulging and purple
his only slow and deliberate action was the reloading of his gun
then he crashed through the doors and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle hauling his horse up high and goading him to plunge away
men running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust flying down the road
and then they trooped out to see it disappear
the hour of suspense ended for them
las vegas had lived up to the code of the west had dared his man out had waited far longer than needful to prove that man a coward
whatever the issue now beasley was branded forever
that moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded
he and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face him but that would not change the brand
the preceding night beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his newly acquired ranch when buck weaver one of his men burst in upon him with news of the death of mulvey and pedro
who's in the outfit
how many he had questioned quickly
it's a oneman outfit boss replied weaver
beasley appeared astounded
he and his men had prepared to meet the friends of the girl whose property he had taken over and because of the superiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended feud
this amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult form
one man he ejaculated
yep
thet cowboy las vegas
an' boss he turns out to be a gunslinger from texas
i was in turner's
hed jest happened to step in the other room when las vegas come bustin' in on his hoss an' jumped off fust thing he called jeff an' pedro
they both showed yaller
an' then damn if thet cowboy didn't turn his back on them an' went to the bar fer a drink
but he was lookin' in the mirror an' when jeff an' pedro went fer their guns why he whirled quick as lightnin' an' bored them both
i sneaked out an  why didn't you bore him roared beasley
buck weaver steadily eyed his boss before he replied
i ain't takin' shots at any fellar from behind doors
an' as fer meetin' las vegasexcoose me boss
i've still a hankerin' fer sunshine an' red liquor
besides i 'ain't got nothin' ag'in' las vegas
if he's rustled over here at the head of a crowd to put us off i'd fight jest as we'd all fight
but you see we figgered wrong
it's between you an' las vegas
you oughter seen him throw thet hunter dale out of turner's  dale
did he come queried beasley
he got there just after the cowboy plugged jeff
an' thet bigeyed girl she came runnin' in too
an' she keeled over in dale's arms
las vegas shoved him outcussed him so hard we all heerd
so beasley there ain't no fight comin' off as we figgered on  beasley thus heard the west speak out of the mouth of his own man
and grim sardonic almost scornful indeed were the words of buck weaver
this rider had once worked for al auchincloss and had deserted to beasley under mulvey's leadership
mulvey was dead and the situation was vastly changed
beasley gave weaver a dark lowering glance and waved him away
from the door weaver sent back a doubtful scrutinizing gaze then slouched out
that gaze beasley had not encountered before
it meant as weaver's cronies meant as beasley's longfaithful riders and the people of the range and as the spirit of the west meant that beasley was expected to march down into the village to face his single foe
but beasley did not go
instead he paced to and fro the length of helen rayner's long sittingroom with the nervous energy of a man who could not rest
many times he hesitated and at others he made sudden movements toward the door only to halt
long after midnight he went to bed but not to sleep
he tossed and rolled all night and at dawn arose gloomy and irritable
he cursed the mexican servingwomen who showed their displeasure at his authority
and to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to the house
he waited and waited
then he stalked off to the corrals and stables carrying a rifle with him
the men were there in a group that dispersed somewhat at his advent
not a mexican was in sight
beasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into the village with him
that order was disobeyed
beasley stormed and raged
his riders sat or lounged with lowered faces
an unspoken hostility seemed present
those who had been longest with him were least distant and strange but still they did not obey
at length beasley roared for his mexicans
boss we gotta tell you thet every greaser on the ranch hes slopedgone these two hourson the way to magdalena said buck weaver
of all these suddenuprising perplexities this latest was the most astounding
beasley cursed with his questioning wonder
boss they was sure scared of thet gunslingin' cowboy from texas  replied weaver imperturbably
beasley's dark swarthy face changed its hue
what of the subtle reflection in weaver's slow speech
one of the men came out of a corral leading beasley's saddled and bridled horse
this fellow dropped the bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word
no one spoke
the presence of the horse was significant
with a snarling muttered curse beasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranchhouse
in his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for hoursthat if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well as for his life the hour was long past
beasley avoided the open paths to the house and when he got there he nervously poured out a drink
evidently something in the fiery liquor frightened him for he threw the bottle aside
it was as if that bottle contained a courage which was false
again he paced the long sittingroom growing more and more wroughtup as evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs
twice the pale servingwoman called him to dinner
the diningroom was light and pleasant and the meal fragrant and steaming was ready for him
but the women had disappeared
beasley seated himselfspread out his big hands on the table
then a slight rustlea clink of spurstartled him
he twisted his head
howdy beasley said las vegas who had appeared as if by magic
beasley's frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his veins
sweatdrops stood out on his pallid face
whatyouwant he asked huskily
wal now my boss miss helen says seein' i am foreman heah thet it'd be nice an' proper fer me to drop in an' eat with youthe last time  replied the cowboy
his drawl was slow and cool his tone was friendly and pleasant
but his look was that of a falcon ready to drive deep its beak
beasley's reply was loud incoherent hoarse
las vegas seated himself across from beasley
eat or not it's shore all the same to me said las vegas and he began to load his plate with his left hand
his right hand rested very lightly with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of the table and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his piercing eyes off beasley
wal my halfbreed greaser guest it shore roils up my blood to see you sittin' therethinkin' you've put my boss miss helen off this ranch  began las vegas softly
and then he helped himself leisurely to food and drink
in my day i've shore stacked up against a lot of outlaws thieves rustlers an' sich like but fer an out an' out dirty lowdown skunk you shore take the dough
i'm goin to kill you in a minit or so jest as soon as you move one of them dirty paws of yourn
but i hope you'll be polite an' let me say a few words
i'll never be happy again if you don't of all theyaller greaser dogs i ever seen you're the worst
i was thinkin' last night mebbe you'd come down an' meet me like a man so 's i could wash my hands ever afterward without gettin' sick to my stummick
but you didn't come beasley i'm so ashamed of myself thet i gotta call youwhen i ought to bore you theti ain't even second cousin to my old self when i rode fer chisholm
it don't mean nuthin' to you to call you liar
robber
blackleg
a sneakin' coyote
an' a cheat thet hires others to do his dirty work
by gawd  carmichael gimme a word in hoarsely broke out beasley
you're right it won't do no good to call me
but let's talk
i'll buy you off
ten thousand dollars  haw
haw
haw roared las vegas
he was as tense as a strung cord and his face possessed a singular pale radiance
his right hand began to quiver more and more
i'lldoubleit panted beasley
i'llmake overhalf the ranchall the stock  swaller thet yelled las vegas with terrible strident ferocity
listenman
i takeit back
i'll give upauchincloss's ranch  beasley was now a shaking whispering frenzied man ghastly white with rolling eyes
las vegas's left fist pounded hard on the table
greaser come on he thundered
then beasley with desperate frantic action jerked for his gun
chapter xxvi  for helen rayner that brief dark period of expulsion from her home had become a thing of the past almost forgotten
two months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of finding her place there in the west
all her old men had been only too glad of the opportunity to come back to her and under dale and roy beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch
helen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of rooms and adding a new section
only once had she ventured into the old diningroom where las vegas carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner for beasley
she made a storeroom of it and a place she would never again enter
helen was happy almost too happy she thought and therefore made more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of life
carmichael had ridden out of pine ostensibly on the trail of the mexicans who had executed beasley's commands
the last seen of him had been reported from show down where he had appeared redeyed and dangerous like a hound on a scent
then two months had flown by without a word
dale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's absence
it would be just like las vegas never to be heard of again
also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his drunken savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by his friends
bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than helen
but bo grew more restless wilder and more wilful than ever
helen thought she guessed bo's secret and once she ventured a hint concerning carmichael's return
if tom doesn't come back pretty soon i'll marry milt dale retorted bo tauntingly
this fired helen's cheeks with red
but child she protested half angry half grave
milt and i are engaged  sure
only you're so slow
there's many a slipyou know  bo i tell you tom will come back replied helen earnestly
i feel it
there was something fine in that cowboy
he understood me better than you or milt either and he was perfectly wild in love with you  oh
was he  very much more than you deserved bo rayner  then occurred one of bo's sweet bewildering unexpected transformations
her defiance resentment rebelliousness vanished from a softly agitated face
oh nell i know that you just watch me if i ever get another chance at him
thenmaybe he'd never drink again  bo be happyand be good
don't ride off any moredon't tease the boys
it'll all come right in the end  bo recovered her equanimity quickly enough
humph
you can afford to be cheerful
you've got a man who can't live when you're out of his sight
he's like a fish on dry land and youwhy once you were an old pessimist  bo was not to be consoled or changed
helen could only sigh and pray that her convictions would be verified
the first day of july brought an early thunderstorm just at sunrise
it roared and flared and rolled away leaving a gorgeous golden cloud pageant in the sky and a fresh sweetly smelling glistening green range that delighted helen's eye
birds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the flowers
from the fields down along the brook came a blended song of swampblackbird and meadowlark
a clarionvoiced burro split the air with his coarse and homely bray
the sheep were bleating and a soft baa of little lambs came sweetly to helen's ears
she went her usual rounds with more than usual zest and thrill
everywhere was color activity life
the wind swept warm and pinescented down from the mountain heights now black and bold and the great green slopes seemed to call to her
at that very moment she came suddenly upon dale in his shirtsleeves dusty and hot standing motionless gazing at the distant mountains
helen's greeting startled him
ii was just looking away yonder he said smiling
she thrilled at the clear wonderful light of his eyes
so was ia moment ago she replied wistfully
do you miss the forestvery much  nell i miss nothing
but i'd like to ride with you under the pines once more  we'll go she cried
when he asked eagerly
ohsoon and then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on
for long helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in paradise park where she had fallen in love with dale and had realized herself
but she had kept that hope secret
dale's eager tone his flashing eyes had made her feel that her secret was there in her telltale face
as she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the new stableboys driving a packmule
jim whose pack is that she asked
ma'am i dunno but i heard him tell roy he reckoned his name was mud  replied the boy smiling
helen's heart gave a quick throb
that sounded like las vegas
she hurried on and upon entering the courtyard she espied roy beeman holding the halter of a beautiful wildlooking mustang
there was another horse with another man who was in the act of dismounting on the far side
when he stepped into better view helen recognized las vegas
and he saw her at the same instant
helen did not look up again until she was near the porch
she had dreaded this meeting yet she was so glad that she could have cried aloud
miss helen i shore am glad to see you he said standing bareheaded before her the same young frankfaced cowboy she had seen first from the train
tom she exclaimed and offered her hands
he wrung them hard while he looked at her
the swift woman's glance helen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of her heart
this was the same boy she had knownwhom she had liked so wellwho had won her sister's love
helen imagined facing him thus was like awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt
carmichael's face was clean fresh young with its healthy tan it wore the old glad smile cool easy and natural his eyes were like dale'spenetrating clear as crystal without a shadow
what had evil drink blood to do with the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of western hardihood
wherever he had been whatever he had done during that long absence he had returned long separated from that wild and savage character she could now forget
perhaps there would never again be call for it
how's my girl he asked just as naturally as if he had been gone a few days on some errand of his employer's
bo
oh she's wellfine
ii rather think she'll be glad to see you  replied helen warmly
an' how's thet big indian dale he drawled
well tooi'm sure  reckon i got back heah in time to see youall married  ii assure you ino one around here has been married yet replied helen with a blush
thet shore is fine
was some worried he said lazily
i've been chasin' wild hosses over in new mexico an' i got after this heah blue roan
he kept me chasin' him fer a spell
i've fetched him back for bo  helen looked at the mustang roy was holding to be instantly delighted
he was a roan almost blue in color neither large nor heavy but powerfully built cleanlimbed and racy with a long mane and tail black as coal and a beautiful head that made helen love him at once
well i'm jealous declared helen archly
i never did see such a pony  i reckoned you'd never ride any hoss but ranger said las vegas
no i never will
but i can be jealous anyhow can't i  shore
an i reckon if you say you're goin' to have himwal bo 'd be funny he drawled
i reckon she would be funny retorted helen
she was so happy that she imitated his speech
she wanted to hug him
it was too good to be truethe return of this cowboy
he understood her
he had come back with nothing that could alienate her
he had apparently forgotten the terrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her enemies
that moment was wonderful for helen in its revelation of the strange significance of the west as embodied in this cowboy
he was great
but he did not know that
then the door of the livingroom opened and a sweet high voice pealed out  roy
oh what a mustang
whose is he  wal bo if all i hear is so he belongs to you replied roy with a huge grin
bo appeared in the door
she stepped out upon the porch
she saw the cowboy
the excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled
bo i shore am glad to see you drawled las vegas as he stepped forward sombrero in hand
helen could not see any sign of confusion in him
but indeed she saw gladness
then she expected to behold bo run right into the cowboys's arms
it appeared however that she was doomed to disappointment
tom i'm glad to see you she replied
they shook hands as old friends
you're lookin' right fine he said
oh i'm well and how have you been these six months she queried
reckon i though it was longer he drawled
wal i'm pretty tiptop now but i was laid up with heart trouble for a spell  heart trouble she echoed dubiously
shore
i ate too much over heah in new mexico  it's no news to mewhere your heart's located laughed bo
then she ran off the porch to see the blue mustang
she walked round and round him clasping her hands in sheer delight
bo he's a plumb dandy said roy
never seen a prettier hoss
he'll run like a streak
an' he's got good eyes
he'll be a pet some day
but i reckon he'll always be spunky  bo ventured to step closer and at last got a hand on the mustang and then another
she smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him until he submitted to her hold
what's his name she asked
blue somethin' or other replied roy
tom has my new mustang a name asked bo turning to the cowboy
shore  what then  wal i named him bluebo answered las vegas with a smile
blueboy  nope
he's named after you
an' i chased him roped him broke him all myself  very well
bluebo he is then and he's a wonderful darling horse
oh nell just look at him tom i can't thank you enough  reckon i don't want any thanks drawled the cowboy
but see heah bo you shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him  what exclaimed bo who was startled by his slow cool meaning tone of voice
helen delighted in looking at las vegas then
he had never appeared to better advantage
so cool careless and assured
he seemed master of a situation in which his terms must be accepted
yet he might have been actuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of helen to divine
bo rayner drawled las vegas thet blue mustang will be yours an' you can ride himwhen you're mrs tom carmichael  never had he spoken a softer more drawling speech nor gazed at bo more mildly
roy seemed thunderstruck
helen endeavored heroically to restrain her delicious bursting glee
bo's wide eyes stared at her loverdarkeneddilated
suddenly she left the mustang to confront the cowboy where he lounged on the porch steps
do you mean that she cried
shore do  bah
it's only a magnificent bluff she retorted
you're only in fun
it's youryour darned nerve  why bo began las vegas reproachfully
you shore know i'm not the fourflusher kind
never got away with a bluff in my life
an' i'm jest in daid earnest aboot this heah  all the same signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was almost unable to restrain his mirth
helen realized then that bo saw through the cowboythat the ultimatum was only one of his tricks
it is a bluff and i call you declared bo ringingly
las vegas suddenly awoke to consequences
he essayed to speak but she was so wonderful then so white and blazingeyed that he was stricken mute
i'll ride bluebo this afternoon deliberately stated the girl
las vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning and he seemed about to collapse
very well you can make me mrs tom carmichael todaythis morningjust before dinner go get a preacher to marry usand make yourself look a more presentable bridegroomunless it was only a bluff  her imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed to make las vegas a blank stone image of a man
with a wildrose color suffusing her face she swiftly bent over him kissed him and flashed away into the house
her laugh pealed back and it thrilled helen so deep and strange was it for the wilful sister so wild and merry and full of joy
it was then that roy beeman recovered from his paralysis to let out such a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses
helen was laughing and crying too but laughing mostly
las vegas carmichael was a sight for the gods to behold
bo's kiss had unclamped what had bound him
the sudden truth undeniable insupportable glorious made him a madman
bluffshe called meride bluebo saf'ternoon he raved reaching wildly for helen
mrstomcarmichaelbefore dinnerpreacherpresentable bridegroom
aw
i'm drunk again
iwho swore off forever  no tom you're just happy said helen
between her and roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the situation and to see his wonderful opportunity
nownow miss helenwhat'd bo mean by prepresentable bridegroom
presents
lord i'm clean busted flat  she meant you must dress up in your best of course replied helen
where 'n earth will i get a preacher
show down's forty miles can't ride there in time roy i've gotta have a preacher life or death deal fer me  wal old man if you'll brace up i'll marry you to bo said roy with his glad grin
aw gasped las vegas as if at the coming of a sudden beautiful hope
tom i'm a preacher replied roy now earnestly
you didn't know thet but i am
an' i can marry you an' bo as good as any one an' tighter 'n most  las vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached for solid rock
roy can you really marry themwith my bibleand the service of my church asked helen a happy hope flushing her face
wal indeed i can
i've married more 'n one couple whose religion wasn't mine  bbbeforedddinner burst out las vegas like a stuttering idiot
i reckon
come on now an' make yourself presenttible said roy
miss helen you tell bo thet it's all settled  he picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the corrals
las vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm and seemed to be following in a trance with his dazed rapt face held high
bring dale called helen softly after them
so it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that bo rode the blue mustang before the afternoon ended
las vegas disobeyed his first orders from mrs tom carmichael and rode out after her toward the greenrising range
helen seemed impelled to follow
she did not need to ask dale the second time
they rode swiftly but never caught up with bo and las vegas whose riding resembled their happiness
dale read helen's mind or else his own thoughts were in harmony with hers for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking
and as they rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a few days to visit his old camp
and take boand tom
oh of all things i'd like to' she replied
yesan' roy too added dale significantly
of course said helen lightly as if she had not caught his meaning
but she turned her eyes away while her heart thumped disgracefully and all her body was aglow
will tom and bo go  it was tom who got me to ask you replied dale
john an' hal can look after the men while we're gone  ohso tom put it in your head
i guessmaybei won't go  it is always in my mind nell he said with his slow seriousness
i'm goin' to work all my life for you
but i'll want to an' need to go back to the woods often an' if you ever stoop to marry mean' make me the richest of menyou'll have to marry me up there where i fell in love with you  ah
did las vegas tom carmichael say that too inquired helen softly
nell do you want to know what las vegas said  by all means  he said thisan' not an hour ago
'milt old hoss let me give you a hunch
i'm a man of family nowan' i've been a devil with the wimmen in my day
i can see through 'em
don't marry nell rayner in or near the house where i killed beasley
she'd remember
an' don't let her remember thet day
go off into the woods
paradise park
bo an' me will go with you  helen gave him her hand while they walked the horses homeward in the long sunset shadows
in the fullness of that happy hour she had time for a grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy carmichael
dale had saved her life but it was las vegas who had saved her happiness
not many days later when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low helen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far above paradise park
roy was singing as he drove the packburros down the slope bo and las vegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast so they could hold hands dale had dismounted to stand beside helen's horse as she gazed down the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray meadows and shining ribbons of brooks
it was july and there were no goldenred glorious flames and blazes of color such as lingered in helen's memory
black spruce slopes and green pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark outcroppings of rockthese colors and forms greeted her gaze with all the old enchantment
wildness beauty and loneliness were there the same as ever immutable like the spirit of those heights
helen would fain have lingered longer but the others called and ranger impatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below
and she knew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be another woman
nell come on said dale as he led on
it's better to look up   the sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountainrim when those three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and had prepared a bountiful supper
then roy beeman took out the little worn bible which helen had given him to use when he married bo and as he opened it a light changed his dark face
come helen an' dale he said
they arose to stand before him
and he married them there under the great stately pines with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward and the wind singing through the branches while the waterfall murmured its low soft dreamy music and from the dark slope came the wild lonely cry of a wolf full of the hunger for life and a mate
let us pray said roy as he closed the bible and knelt with them
there is only one god an' him i beseech in my humble office for the woman an' man i have just wedded in holy bonds
bless them an' watch them an' keep them through all the comin' years
bless the sons of this strong man of the woods an' make them like him with love an' understandin' of the source from which life comes
bless the daughters of this woman an' send with them more of her love an' soul which must be the softenin' an' the salvation of the hard west
o lord blaze the dim dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life
o lord lead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows
we ask in thy name
amen  when the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their kneeling posture it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left him
this young man was again the darkfaced cleareyed roy droll and dry with the enigmatic smile on his lips
mrs
dale he said taking her hands i wish you joy an' now after this here my crownin' service in your behalfi reckon i'll claim a reward  then he kissed her
bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations and the cowboy with characteristic action also made at helen
nell shore it's the only chance i'll ever have to kiss you he drawled
because when this heah big indian once finds out what kissin' is  las vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions
all this left helen red and confused and unutterably happy
she appreciated dale's state
his eyes reflected the precious treasure which manifestly he saw but realization of ownership had not yet become demonstrable
then with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook of the supper
when it was finished roy made known his intention to leave
they all protested and coaxed but to no avail
he only laughed and went on saddling his horse
roy please stay implored helen
the day's almost ended
you're tired  nope
i'll never be no third party when there's only two  but there are four of us  didn't i just make you an' dale one
an' mrs dale you forget i've been married more 'n once  helen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument
las vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth
dale looked strange
roy then that's why you're so nice said bo with a little devil in her eyes
do you know i had my mind made up if tom hadn't come around i was going to make up to you roy
i sure was
what number wife would i have been  it always took bo to turn the tables on anybody
roy looked mightily embarrassed
and the laugh was on him
he did not face them again until he had mounted
las vegas i've done my best for youhitched you to thet blueeyed girl the best i know how he declared
but i shore ain't guaranteein' nothin'
you'd better build a corral for her  why roy you shore don't savvy the way to break these wild ones  drawled las vegas
bo will be eatin' out of my hand in about a week  bo's blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary claim
goodby friends said roy and rode away to disappear in the spruces
thereupon bo and las vegas forgot roy and dale and helen the camp chores to be done and everything else except themselves
helen's first wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her husband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper
before they had finished a sound startled them
it came from roy evidently high on the darkening slope and was a long mellow pealing halloo that rang on the cool air burst the dreamy silence and rapped across from slope to slope and cliff to cliff to lose its power and die away hauntingly in the distant recesses
dale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that beautiful call
silence once again enfolded the park and twilight seemed to be born of the air drifting downward
nell do you miss anythin' asked dale
no
nothing in all the world she murmured
i am happier than i ever dared pray to be  i don't mean people or things
i mean my pets  ah
i had forgotten milt where are they  gone back to the wild he said
they had to live in my absence
an' i've been away long  just then the brooding silence with its soft murmur of falling water and faint sigh of wind in the pines was broken by a piercing scream high quivering like that of a woman in exquisite agony
that's tom exclaimed dale
ohi was soso frightened whispered helen
bo came running with las vegas at her heels
milt that was your tame cougar cried bo excitedly
oh i'll never forget him
i'll hear those cries in my dreams  yes it was tom said dale thoughtfully
but i never heard him cry just like that  oh call him in  dale whistled and called but tom did not come
then the hunter stalked off in the gloom to call from different points under the slope
after a while he returned without the cougar
and at that moment from far up the dark ravine drifted down the same wild cry only changed by distance strange and tragic in its meaning
he scented us
he remembers
but he'll never come back said dale
helen felt stirred anew with the convictions of dale's deep knowledge of life and nature
and her imagination seemed to have wings
how full and perfect her trust her happiness in the realization that her love and her future her children and perhaps grandchildren would come under the guidance of such a man
only a little had she begun to comprehend the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature
ages before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of the wilderness and the holes of the rocks and the nests of the trees and rain frost heat dew sunlight and night storm and calm the honey of the wildflower and the instinct of the beeall the beautiful and multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design
to know something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of earthperhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven
for whatever breathed and moved was a part of that creation
the coo of the dove the lichen on the mossy rock the mourn of a hunting wolf and the murmur of the waterfall the evergreen and growing tips of the spruces and the thunderbolts along the battlements of the heightsthese one and all must be actuated by the great spiritthat incalculable thing in the universe which had produced man and soul
and there in the starlight under the widegnarled pines sighing low with the wind helen sat with dale on the old stone that an avalanche of a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as camptable and bench for lovers in the wilderness the sweet scent of spruce mingled with the fragrance of woodsmoke blown in their faces
how white the stars and calm and true
how they blazed their single task
a coyote yelped off on the south slope dark now as midnight
a bit of weathered rock rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf
and the wind moaned
helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this lonely fastness and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness that all would some day be well with the troubled world beyond
nell i'll homestead this park said dale
then it'll always be ours  homestead
what's that murmured helen dreamily
the word sounded sweet
the government will give land to men who locate an' build replied dale
we'll run up a log cabin  and come here often paradise park whispered helen
dale's first kisses were on her lips then hard and cool and clean like the life of the man singularly exalting to her completing her woman's strange and unutterable joy of the hour and rendering her mute
bo's melodious laugh and her voice with its old mockery of torment drifted softly on the night breeze
and the cowboy's aw bo drawling his reproach and longing was all that the tranquil waiting silence needed
paradise park was living again one of its romances
love was no stranger to that lonely fastness
helen heard in the whisper of the wind through the pine the oldearth story beautiful ever new and yet eternal
she thrilled to her depths
the sparpointed spruces stood up black and clear against the noble stars
all that vast solitude breathed and waited charged full with its secret ready to reveal itself to her tremulous soul
