i  making good with mother   when men began to build cities vertically instead of horizontally there passed from our highways a picturesque figure and from our language an expressive figure of speech
that oilytongued persuasive softstepping stranger in the rusty prince albert and the black string tie who had been wont to haunt our back steps and front offices with his carefully wrapped bundle retreated in bewildered defeat before the clanging blows of steel on steel that meant the erection of the first twentystory skyscraper
as slick we used to say as a lightningrod agent
of what use his wares on a building whose tower was robed in clouds and which used the chain lightning for a necklace
the fourth avenue antique dealer had another curio to add to his collection of andirons knockers snuff boxes and warming pans
but even as this quaint figure vanished there sprang up a new and glittering one to take his place
he stood framed in the great plateglass window of the very building which had brought about the defeat of his predecessor
a miracle of close shaving his face was and a marvel of immaculateness his linen
dapper he was and dressy albeit inclined to glittering effects and a certain plethory at the back of the neck
back of him stood shining shapes that reflected his glory in enamel and brass and glass
his language was floral but choice his talk was of gearings and bearings and cylinders and magnetos his method differed from that of him who went before as the method of a skilled aronaut differs from that of the man who goes over niagara in a barrel
and as he multiplied and spread over the land we coined a new figure of speech
smooth
we chuckled
as smooth as an automobile salesman
but even as we listened fascinated by his fluent verbiage there grew within us a certain resentment
familiarity with his glittering wares bred a contempt of them so that he fell to speaking of them as necessities instead of luxuries
he juggled figures and thought nothing of four of them in a row
we looked at our fivethousanddollar salary so strangely shrunken and thin now and even as we looked we saw that the method of the unctuous anxious stranger had become antiquated in its turn
then from his ashes emerged a new being
neither urger nor spellbinder he
the twentieth century was stamped across his brow and on his lips was ever the word service
silent courteous watchful alert he listened while you talked
his method in turn made that of the silklined salesman sound like the hoarse hoots of the ballyhoo man at a county fair
blithely he accepted five hundred thousand dollars and gave in returna promise
and when we would search our soul for a synonym to express all that was lowvoiced and suave and judicious and patient and sure we began to say as alert as an advertising expert
jock mcchesney looking as fresh and cleareyed as only twentyone and a cold shower can make one look stood in the doorway of his mother's bedroom
his toilette had halted abruptly at the bathrobe stage
one of those bulky garments swathed his slim figure while over his left arm hung a gray tweed norfolk coat
from his right hand dangled a pair of trousers in pattern a modish blackandwhite
jock regarded the gray garment on his arm with moody eyes
well i'd like to know what's the matter with it
he demanded a trifle irritably
emma mcchesney in the act of surveying her back hair in the mirror paused hand glass poised half way to regard her son
all right she answered cheerfully
i'll tell you
it's too young
young
he held it at arm's length and stared at it
what d'you meanyoung
emma mcchesney came forward wrapping the folds of her kimono about her
she took the disputed garment in one hand and held it aloft
i know that you look like a man on a magazine cover in it
but norfolk suits spell tennis and seashore and elegant leisure
and you're going out this morning son to interview business men
you're going to try to impress the advertising world with the fact that it needs your expert services
you walk into a business office in a norfolk suit and everybody from the office boy to the president of the company will ask you what your score is
she tossed it back over his arm
i'll wear the black and white said jock resignedly and turned toward his own room
at his doorway he paused and raised his voice slightly for that matter they're looking for young men
everybody's young
why the biggest men in the advertising game are just kids
he disappeared within his room still talking
look at mcquirk advertising manager of the combs car company
he's so young he has to disguise himself in bonetrimmed eyeglasses with a black ribbon to get away with it
look at hopper of the berg shriner company
pulls down ninety thousand a year and if he's thirtyfive i'll  well you asked my advice interrupted his mother's voice with that muffled effect which is caused by a skirt being slipped over the head and i gave it
wear a white duck sailor suit with blue anchors and carry a red tin pail and a shovel if you want to look young
only get into it in a jiffy son because breakfast will be ready in ten minutes
i can tell by the way annie's crashing the cups
so step lively if you want to pay your lovely mother's subway fare
ten minutes later the slim young figure in its englishfitting black and white sat opposite emma mcchesney at the breakfast table and between excited gulps of coffee outlined a meteoric career in his chosen field
and the more he talked and the rosier his figures of speech became the more silent and thoughtful fell his mother
she wondered if five o'clock would find a droop to the set of those young shoulders if the springy young legs in their absurdly scant modish trousers would have lost some of their elasticity if the buoyant step in the flatheeled shoes would not drag a little
thirteen years of business experience had taught her to swallow smilingly the bitter pill of rebuff
but this boy was to experience his first dose today
she felt again that sensation of almost physical nauseathat sickness of heart and spirit which had come over her when she had met her first sneer and intolerant shrug
it had been her maiden trip on the road for the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company
she was secretary of that company now and moving spirit in its policy
but the wound of that first insult still ached
a word from her would have placed the boy and saved him from curt refusals
she withheld that word
he must fight his fight alone
i want to write the kind of ad jock was saying excitedly that you see 'em staring at in the subways and street cars and ltrains
i want to sit across the aisle and watch their upturned faces staring at that oblong and reading it aloud to each other
isn't that an awfully obvious necktie you're wearing jock
inquired his mother irrelevantly
this
you ought to see some of them
this is a quaker stock in comparison
he glanced down complacently at the vividhued silken scarf that the season's mode demanded
immediately he was off again
and the first thing you know mrs mcchesney ma'am we'll have a motor truck backing up at the door once a month and six strong men carrying my salary to the freight elevator in sacks
emma mcchesney buttered her bit of toast then looked up to remark quietly  hadn't you better qualify for the trial heats jock before you jump into the finals
trial heats
sneered jock
they're poky
i want real money
now
it isn't enough to be just welltodo in these days
it needs money
i want to be rich
not just prosperous but rich
so rich that i can let the bath soap float around in the water without any pricks of conscience
so successful that they'll say 'and he's a mere boy too
imagine'
and jock dear emma mcchesney said you've still to learn that plans and ambitions are like soap bubbles
the harder you blow and the more you inflate them the quicker they burst
plans and ambitions are things to be kept locked away in your heart son with no one but yourself to take an occasional peep at them
jock leaned over the table with his charming smile
you're a jealous blonde he laughed
because i'm going to be a captain of financean advertising wizard you're afraid i'll grab the glory all away from you
illustration 'you're a jealous blond' he said  mrs mcchesney folded her napkin and rose
she looked unbelievably young and trim and radiant to be the mother of this boasting boy
i'm not afraid she drawled a wicked little glint in her blue eyes
you see they'll only regard your feats and say 'h'm no wonder
he ought to be able to sell ice to an eskimo
his mother was emma mcchesney'
and then being a modern mother she donned smart autumn hat and tailored suit coat and stood ready to reach her office by ninethirty
but because she was as motherly as she was modern she swung open the door between kitchen and diningroom to advise with annie the adept
lamb chops tonight eh annie
and sweet potatoes
jock loves 'em
and corn au gratin and some head lettuce
she glanced toward jock in the hallway then lowered her voice
annie she teased just give us one of your peach cobblers will you
you see hehe's going to be awfullytired when he gets home
so they went stepping off to work together mother and son
a mother of twentyfive years before would have watched her son with teardimmed eyes from the vinewreathed porch of a cottage
there was no watching a son from the tenth floor of an uptown apartment house
besides she had her work to do
the subway swallowed both of them
together they jostled and swung their way downtown in the close packed train
at the twentythird street station jock left her
you'll have dinner tonight with a fullfledged professional gent he bragged in his youth and exuberance and was off down the aisle and out on the platform
emma mcchesney managed to turn in her nineinch space of train seat so that she watched the slim buoyant young figure from the window until the train drew away and he was lost in the stairway jam
just so rachel had watched the boy joseph go to meet the persian caravans in the desert
don't let them buffalo you jock emma had said just before he left her
they'll try it
if they give you a broom and tell you to sweep down the back stairs take it and sweep and don't forget the corners
and if while you're sweeping you notice that that kind of broom isn't suited to the stairs go in and suggest a new kind
they'll like it
brooms and back stairways had no place in jock mcchesney's mind as the mahogany and gold elevator shot him up to the fourteenth floor of the great office building that housed the berg shriner company
down the marble hallway he went and into the reception room
a cruel test it was that reception room with the cruelty peculiar to the modern in business
with its softshaded lamp its twotoned rug its jacobean chairs its magazineladen cathedral oak table its pot of bright flowers making a smart touch of color in the somber richness of the room it was no place for the shabby the downandout the cringing the rusty or the mendicant
jock mcchesney from the tips of his twelvedollar shoes to his radiant face took the test and stood it triumphantly
he had entered with an air in which was mingled the briskness of assurance with the languor of ease
there were times when jock mcchesney was every inch the son of his mother
there advanced toward jock a large plump dignified personage a personage courteous yet reserved inquiring yet not offensively curiousa very machiavelli of receptionroom ushers
even while his lips questioned his eyes appraised clothes character conduct
mr hupp please said jock serene in the perfection of his shirt tie collar and scarf pin upon which the appraising eye now rested
mr
mcchesney
he produced a card
appointment
nobut he'll see me
but machiavelli had seen too many overconfident callers
their very confidence had taught him caution
if you will please state yourahbusiness  jock smiled a little patient smile and brushed an imaginary fleck of dust from the sleeve of his very correct coat
i want to ask him for a job as office boy he jibed
an answering grin overspread the fat features of the usher
even an usher likes his little joke
the sense of humor dies hard
i have a letter from him asking me to call said jock to clinch it
this way
the keeper of the door led jock toward the sacred inner portal and held it open
mr hupp's is the last door to the right
the door closed behind him
jock found himself in the big busy lightflooded central office
down either side of the great room ran a row of tiny private offices each partitioned off each outfitted with desk and chairs and a big bright window
on his way to the last door at the right jock glanced into each tiny office glimpsing busy men bent absorbedly over papers girls busy with dictation here and there a door revealing two men or three deep in discussion of a problem heads close together voices low faces earnest
it came suddenly to the smartly modish overconfident boy walking the length of the long room that the last person needed in this marvelously perfected and smoothrunning organization was a somewhat awed young man named jock mcchesney
there came to him that strange sensation which comes to every jobhunter that feeling of having his spiritual legs carry him out of the room past the door down the hall and into the street even as in reality they bore him on to the very presence which he dreaded and yet wished to see
two steps more and he stood in the last doorway right
no matinee idol nervously awaiting his cue in the wings could have planned his entrance more carefully than jock had planned this
ease was the thing ease bordering on nonchalance mixed with a brisk and businesslike assurance
the entrance was lost on the man at the desk
he did not even look up
if jock had entered on allfours doing a double tango to vocal accompaniment it is doubtful if the man at the desk would have looked up
pencil between his fingers head held a trifle to one side in critical contemplation of the work before him eyes narrowed judicially lips pursed he was the concentrated essence of doitnow
illustration he was the concentrated essence of doitnow  jock waited a moment in silence
the man at the desk worked on
his head was semibald
jock knew him to be thirty
jock fixed his eye on the semibald spot and spoke
my name's mcchesney he began
i wrote you three days ago you probably will remember
you replied asking me to call and i  minute exploded the man at the desk still absorbed
jock faltered stopped
the man at the desk did not look up
a moment of silence except for the sound of the busy pencil traveling across the paper
jock glaring at the semibald spot spoke again
of course mr hupp if you're too busy to see me  mmmm a preoccupied hum such as a busy man makes when he is trying to give attention to two interests  
why i suppose there's no sense in staying but it seems to me that common courtesy  the busy pencil paused quivered in the making of a final period enclosed the dot in a proofreader's circle and rolled away across the desk its work done
now said sam hupp and swung around smiling to face the affronted jock
i had to get that out
they're waiting for it
he pressed a desk button
what can i do for you
sit down sit down
there was a certain abrupt geniality about him
his tortoiserimmed glasses gave him an oddly owlish look like a small boy taking liberties with grandfather's spectacles
jock found himself sitting down his anger slipping from him
my name's mcchesney he began
i'm here because i want to work for this concern
he braced himself to present the convincing reasonwhy arguments with which he had prepared himself
whereupon sam hupp the brisk proceeded to whisk his breath and arguments away with an unexpected  all right
what do you want to do
jock's mouth fell open
do
he stammered
do
whyanything  sam hupp's quick eye swept over the slim attractive radiant correctlygarbed young figure before him
unconsciously he rubbed his bald spot with a rueful hand
know anything about writing or advertising
jock was at ease immediately
quite a lot yes
i practically rewrote the gridiron play that we gave last year and i was assistant advertising manager of the college publications for two years
that gives a fellow a pretty broad knowledge of advertising
oh lord
groaned sam hupp and covered his eyes with his hand as if in pain
jock stared
the affronted feeling was returning
sam hupp recovered himself and smiled a little wistfully
mcchesney when i came up here twelve years ago i got a job as receptionroom usher
a receptionroom usher is an office boy in long pants
sometimes when i'm optimistic i think that if i live twelve years longer i'll begin to know something about the rudiments of this game
oh of course began jock apologetically
but hupp's glance was over his head
involuntarily jock turned to follow the direction of his eyes
busy
said a voice from the doorway
come in dutch
come in
boomed hupp
the man who entered was of the sort that the boldest might well hesitate to address as dutcha tall slim elegant figure vandyked bronzed
mcchesney this is von herman head of our art department
their hands met in a brief clasp
von herman's thoughts were evidently elsewhere
just wanted to tell you that that cussed model's skipped out
gone with a show
just when i had the whole series blocked out in my mind
he was a wonder
no brains but a marvel for looks and style
these people want real stuff
don't know how i'm going to give it to them now
hupp sat up
got to
he snapped
campaign's late as it is
can't you get an ordinary man model and fake the greek god beauty
yesbut it'll look faked
if i could lay my hands on a chap who could wear clothes as if they belonged to him  hupp rose
here's your man he cried with a snap of his fingers
clothes
look at him
he invented 'em
why you could photograph him and he'd look like a drawing
von herman turned surprised incredulous hopeful his artist eye brightening at the ease and grace and modishness of the smart wellknit figure before him
me
exploded jock his face suffused with a dull painful red
me
pose
for a clothing ad
well hupp reminded him you said you'd do anything
jock mcchesney glared belligerently
hupp returned the stare with a faint gleam of amusement shining behind the absurd glasses
the amused look changed to surprise as he beheld the glare in jock's eyes fading
for even as he glared there had come a warning to jocka warning sent just in time from that wireless station located in his subconscious mind
a vivid face full of pride and hope and encouragement flashed before him
jock it said don't let 'em buffalo you
they'll try it
if they give you a broom and tell you to sweep down the back stairs  jock was smiling his charming boyish smile
lead me to your north light he laughed at von herman
got any robert w chambers's heroines tucked away there
hupp's broad hand came down on his shoulder with a thwack
that's the spirit mcchesney
that's the he stopped abruptly
say are you related to mrs emma mcchesney of the featherloom skirt company
slightly
she's my one and only mother
sheyou meanher son
well i'll be darned
he held out his hand to jock
if you're a real son of your mother i wish you'd just call the office boy as you step down the hall with von herman and tell him to bring me a hammer and a couple of spikes
i'd better nail down my desk
i'll promise not to crowd you for a year or two grinned jock from the doorway and was off with the pleased von herman
past the double row of beehives again into the elevator out again up a narrow iron stairway into a busy cluttered skylighted room
pictures posters photographs hung all about
some of the pictures jock recognized as old friends that had gazed familiarly at him from subway trains and street cars and theater programmes
golf clubs tennis rackets walking sticks billiard cues were stacked up in corners
and yet there was a bare and orderly look about the place
two silent shirtsleeved men were busy at drawing boards
through a doorway beyond jock could see others similarly engaged in the next room
on a platform in one corner of the room posed a young man in one of those costumes the coat of which is a mongrel mixture of cutaway and sack
you see them worn by clergymen with unsecular ideas in dress and by the leader of the counterfeiters' gang in the moving pictures
the pose was that met with in the backs of magazinesthe head lifted eyes fixed on an interesting object unseen one arm crooked to hold a cane one foot advanced the other trailing slightly to give a fifth avenue four o'clock air
his face was expressionless
on his head was a sadly unironed silk hat
von herman glanced at the drawing tacked to the board of one of the men
that'll do flynn he said to the model
he glanced again at the drawing
bring out the hat a little more mack
they won't burnish it if you don'tto the artist
then turning about where's that girl
from a far corner sheltered by long green curtains stepped a graceful almost childishly slim figure in a bronzegreen norfolk suit and closefitting hat from beneath which curled a fluff of bright golden hair
von herman stared at her
you're not the girl he said
you won't do
you sent for me retorted the girl
i'm miss michelingelda michelin
i posed for you six months ago but i've been out of town with the show since then
von herman frowning opened a table drawer pulled out a card index ran his long fingers through it and extracted a card
he glanced at it and then the frown deepening read it aloud
'michelin gelda
telephone bryant 
brunette
medium build
good neck and eyes
good figure
good clothes'
he glanced up
well
that's me said miss michelin calmly
i've got the same telephone number and eyes and neck and clothes
of course my hair is different and i am thinner but that's business
i'd like to know what chance a fat girl would have in the chorus these days
von herman groaned
i'll pay you for the time you've waited and for your trouble
can't use you for these pictures
then as she left he turned a comically despairing face to the two men at the drawing boards
what are we going to do
we've got to make a start on these pictures and everything has gone wrong
they want something special
two figures young man and woman
said expressly they didn't want a chicken
no romping curls and none of that eyes and lips foolgirl stuff
this chap's ideal for the man
he pointed to jock
jock had been staring fascinated at the shaded zigzag marks which the artistdarkskinned velveteyed foreignlooking youthwas making on the sheet of paper before him
he had scarcely glanced up during the entire scene
now he looked briefly and coolly at jock
where did you get him
he asked with the precise enunciation of the foreignborn
good figure
and he wears his clothes not like a cab driver as the others do
thanks drawled jock flushing a little
then boyish curiosity getting the better of him say tell me what in the world are you doing to that drawing
he of the velvety eyes smiled a twisted little smile
his slim brown fingers never stopped in their work of guiding the pen in its zigzag path
it is work he sneered to delight the soul of an artist
i am now engaged in the pleasing task of putting the bones in a herringbone suit
but jock did not smile
here was another man he thought who had been given a broom and told to sweep down the stairway
von herman was regarding him almost wistfully
i hate to let you slip he said
then his face brightening by jove
i wonder if miss galt would pose for us if we told her what a fix we were in
he picked up the telephone receiver
miss galt please he said
then aside of course it's nerve to ask a girl who's earning three thousand a year to leave her desk and come up and pose forhello
miss galt
jock seated on the edge of the models' platform was beginning to enjoy himself
even this end of the advertising business had its interesting side he thought
ten minutes later he knew it had
ten minutes later there appeared miss galt
jock left off swinging his legs from the platform and stood up
miss galt was that kind of girl
smooth black hair parted and coiled low as only an exquisitely shaped head can dare to wear its glorycrown
a face whose expression was sweetly serious in spite of its youth
a girl whose clothes were the sort of clothes that girls ought to wear in offices and don't
this is mighty good of you miss galt began von herman
it's the kool komfort klothes company's summer campaign stuff
we'll only need you for an hour or soto get the expression and general outline
poster stuff really
then this young man will pose for the summer union suit pictures
don't apologize said miss galt
we had a hard enough time to get that kool komfort account
we don't want to start wrong with the pictures
besides i think posing's real fun
jock thought so too quite suddenly
just as suddenly von herman remembered the conventions and introduced them
mcchesney
repeated miss galt crisply
i know a mrs mcchesney of the ta
buck  my mother proudly
your mother
then why she stopped
because said jock i'm the rawest rooky in the berg shriner company
and when i begin to realize what i don't know about advertising i'll probably want to plunge off the palisades
miss galt smiled up at him her clear frank eyes meeting his
you'll win she said
even if i losei win now said jock suddenly audacious
hi
hold that pose
called von herman happily
illustration 'hi
hold that pose'
called von herman     ii  personality plus  there are seven stages in the evolution of that individual whose appearance is the signal for a listless whodoyouwanttosee
from the whitebloused drabhaired anmic little girl who sits in the outer office forever reading last month's magazines
the badge of fear brands the novice
standing hat in hand nervous apprehensive gulpy with the elevator door clanging behind him and the sacred inner door closed before him he offers up a silent and paradoxical thank heaven
at the office girl's languid not in and dives into the friendly shelter of the next elevator going down
when at that same message he can smile as with a certain grim agreeableness he says i'll wait then has he reached the seventh stage and taken the orders of the regularly ordained
jock mcchesney had learned to judge an unknown prospective by glancing at his hall rug and stenographer which marks the fifth stage
he had learned to regard office boys with something less than whitehot hate
he had learned to let the other fellow do the talking
he had learned to condense a written report into twentyfive words
and he had learned that there was as much difference between the profession of advertising as he had thought of it and advertising as it really was as there is between a steam calliope and a cathedral pipe organ
in the big office of the berg shriner advertising company they had begun to chuckle a bit over the mcchesney solicitor's reports
those same reports indicated that young mcchesney was beginning to find the key to that maddening jumble of complexities known as human nature
big sam hupp who was the pet caged copywriting genius of the place used even to bring an occasional example of jock's business badinage into the old man's office and the two would grin in secret
as when they ran thus      pepsinale manufacturing company      mr bowser is the kind of gentleman who curses his     subordinates in front of the whole office force

or still another      hodge manufacturing company      mr hodge is a very conservative gentleman

has gained quite a reputation for     business acumen with this one attribute
spent  last year
holding his breath preparatory to taking another plunge
it was about the time that jock mcchesney had got over the novelty of paying for his own clothes and had begun to talk business in a slightly patronizing way to his clever and secretly amused mother mrs emma mcchesney secretary of the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company that sam hupp noticed a rather cocky overassurance in jock's attitude toward the world in general
whereupon he sent for him
on sam hupp's broad flat desk stood an array of diminutive jars and bottles and tiny pots that would have shamed the toilette table of a musical comedy star's dressingroom
there were rosetinted salves in white bottles
there were white creams in rosetinted jars
there were tins of ointment and boxes of fragrant soap
jock mcchesney entering briskly eyed the array in some surprise
then he grinned and glanced wickedly at sam hupp's prematurely bald head
no use mr hupp
they say if it's once gone it's gone
get a toupee
shut up
growled sam hupp goodhumoredly
stay in this game long enough and you'll be a hairless wonder yourself
ten years ago the girls used to have to tie their hands or wear mittens to keep from running their white fingers through my waving silken locks
sit down a minute
jock reached forward and took up a jar of cream
he frowned in thought
then thought i recognized this stuff
mother uses it
i've seen it on the bathroom shelf
you bet she uses it retorted sam hupp
what's more millions of other women will be using it in the next few years
this woman he pointed to the name on the label has hit upon the real thing in toilette flubdub
she's made a little fortune already and if she don't look out she'll be rich
they've got quite a plant
when she started she used to put the stuff together herself over the kitchen stove
they say it's made of cottage cheese stirred smooth and tinted pink
well anyway they're nationally known nowor will be when they start to advertise right
i've seen some of their stuff advertisedsomewhere interrupted jock but i don't remember  there you are
you see the head of this concern is a little bit frightened at the way she seems slated to become a lady cold cream magnate
they say she's scared pink for fear somebody will steal her recipes
she has a kid nephew who acts as general manager and they're both on the job all the time
they say the lady herself looks like the spinster in a b'gosh drama
you can get a boy to look up your train schedule
train
schedule
across jock mcchesney's mind there flashed a vision of himself alert confident brisk taking the luxurious nine o'clock for philadelphia
or maybe the limited to chicago
dashing down to the station in a taxi of course
strolling down the car aisle to take his place among those other thoroughbreds of commercemen whose chamois gloves and walking sticks and talk of golf and baseball and motoring spelled elegant leisure even as their keen eyes and shrewd faces and lowvoiced exchange of such terms as stocks and sales and propositions proclaimed them intent on bagging the day's business
sam hupp's next words brought him back to reality with a jerk
i think you have to change at buffalo
it gets you to tonawanda in the morning
rotten train
tonawanda
repeated jock
now listen kid
sam hupp leaned forward and his eyes behind their great round blackrimmed glasses were intent on jock
i'm not going to try to steer you
you think that advertising is a game
it isn't
there are those who think it's a science
but it isn't that either
it's white magic that's what it is
and you can't learn it from books any more than you can master trout fishing from reading 'the complete angler'
he swung about and swept the beauty lotions before him in a little heap at the end of his desk
here take this stuff
and get chummy with it
eat it if necessary learn it somehow
jock stood up a little dazed
but whathowi mean  sam hupp glanced up at him
sending you down there isn't my idea
it's the old man's
he's got an idea that you he paused and put a detaining hand on jock mcchesney's arm
look here
you think i know a little something about advertising don't you
you
laughed jock
you're the guy who put the whitening in the great white way
everybody knows you were the  mmm thanks interrupted sam hupp a little dryly
let me tell you something young 'un
i've got what you might call a thirtyhorsepower mind
i keep it running on high all the time with the muffler cut out and you can hear me coming for miles
but the old manhe leaned forward impressivelythe old man boy has the eightypower kind built like a watchno smoke no dripping and you can't even hear the engine purr
but when he throws her open
well he can pass everything on the road
don't forget that
he turned to his desk again and reached for a stack of papers and cuts
good luck to you
if you want any further details you can get 'em from hayes
he plunged into his work
there arose in jock mcchesney's mind that instinct of the man in his hour of triumphthe desire to tell a woman of his greatness
he paused a second outside sam hupp's office turned and walked quickly down the length of the great central room
he stopped before a little glass door at the end tapped lightly and entered
grace galt copywriter looked up frowning a little
then she smiled
miss galt had a complete layout on the desk before herscrap books cuts copy magazines
there was a little smudge on the end of her nose
grace galt was writing about magnetos
she was writing about magnetos in a way to make you want to drop your customer or your ironing or your game and go downtown and buy that particular kind of magneto at once
which is the secretest part of the wizardry of advertising copy
to look at grace galt you would have thought that she should have been writing about the rosetinted jars in jock mcchesney's hands instead of about such things as ignition and insulation and ball bearings and induction windings
but it was grace galt's gift that she could take just such hard dry technical facts and weave them into a story that you followed to the end
she could make you see the romance in condensers and transformers
she had the power that caused the reader to lose himself in the charm of magnetic poles and ball bearings and hightension sparks
just dropped in to say goodby said jock very casually
going to run upstate to see the athena companytoilette specialties you know
it ought to be a big account
athena
grace galt regarded him absently her mind still on her work
then her eyes cleared
you mean at tonawanda
and they're sending you
well
she put out a congratulatory hand
jock gripped it gratefully
not so bad eh
he boasted
bad
echoed grace galt
her face became serious
do you realize that there are men in this office who have been here for five years six years or even more and who have never been given a chance to do anything but stenography or perhaps some private secretarying
i know it agreed jock
but there was no humbleness in his tone
he radiated selfsatisfaction
he seemed to grow and expand before her eyes
a little shadow of doubt crept across grace galt's expression of friendly interest
are you scared she asked just the least bit
jock flushed a little
well he confessed ruefully i don't mind telling you i ama little
good
good
yes
the head of that concern is a woman
that's one reason why they didn't send me i suppose
ii'd like to say something if you don't mind
anything you like said jock graciously
well then don't be afraid of being embarrassed and fussed
if you blush and stammer a little she'll like it
play up the coy stuff
the coy stuff
echoed jock
i hadn't thought much about my attitude toward theerthe ladya little stiffly
well you'd better answered miss galt crisply
she put out her hand in much the same manner as sam hupp had used
good luck to you
i'll have to ask you to go now
i'm trying to make this magneto sound like something without which no home is complete and to make people see that there's as much difference between it and every other magneto as there is between the steam shovels that dug out the panama canal and the junk that the french left there she stopped
her eyes took on a faraway look
her lips were parted slightly
why that's not a bad ideathat last
i'll use that
i'll    illustration with a jolt jock realized she had forgotten all   about him  she began to scribble rapidly on the sheet of paper before her
with a jolt jock mcchesney realized that she had forgotten all about him
he walked quietly to the door opened it shut it very quietly then made for the nearest telephone
he knew one woman he could count on to be proud of him
he gave his number waited a little eager moment then  featherloom petticoat company
mrs
mcchesney
and waited again
then he smiled
you needn't sound so official he laughed it's only your son
listen
ihe took on an elaborate carelessness of tonei've got to take a little jump out of town
on business
oh a day or so
rather important though
i'll have time to run up to the flat and throw a few things into a bag
i'll tell you i really ought to keep a bag packed down here
in case of emergency you know
what
it's the athena toilette preparations company
well i should say it is
i'll wire you
you bet
thanks
my what
oh toothbrush
no
goodby
so it was that at threeten jock mcchesney took himself his hopes his dread and his smart walrus bag aboard a train that halted and snuffed and backed and bumped and halted with maddening frequency
but it landed him at last in a little town bearing the characteristics of all american little towns
it was surprisingly full of sixcylinder cars and five and tencent stores and banks with doric columns and paved streets
after he had registered at the hotel and as he was cleaning up a bit he passed an amused eye over the bare ugly fusty little hotel bedroom
but somehow as he stood in the middle of the room a graceful pleasing figure of youth and confidence the smile faded
towel in hand he surveyed the barrenness of it
he stared at the impossible wall paper at the battered furniture the worn carpet
he sniffed the stuffy smell ofwhat was that smell anyhowstraw and matting and dust and the ghostodor of hundreds who had occupied the room before him
it came over him with something of a shock that this same sort of room had been his mother's only home in the ten years she had spent on the road as a traveling saleswoman for the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company
this was what she had left in the morning
to this she had come back at night
as he stared ahead of him there rose before him a mental picture of herthe brightness of her the sunniness the indomitable energy and pluck and courage
with a sudden burst of new determination he wadded the towel into a moist ball flung it at the washstand seized hat coat and gloves and was off down the hall
so it was with something of his mother's splendid courage in his heart but with nothing of her canny knowledge in his head jock mcchesney fared forth to do battle with the merciless god business
it was tenthirty of a brilliant morning just two days later that a buoyant young figure swung into an elevator in the great office building that housed the berg shriner advertising company
just one more grain of buoyant swing and the young man's walk might have been termed a swagger
as it was his walrus bag just saved him
stepping out of the lift he walked as from habit to the little unlettered door which admitted employes to the big bright inner office
but he did not use it
instead he turned suddenly and walked down the hall to the double door which led into the reception room
he threw out his legs stiffly and came down rather flatfooted the way george cohan does when he's pleased with himself in the second act
hello mack
he called out jovially
mack the usher so called from his machiavellian qualities turned to survey the radiant young figure before him
good morning mr mcchesney he made answer smoothly
mack never forgot himself
his keen eye saw the little halo of selfsatisfaction that hovered above jock mcchesney's head
a successful trip i see
jock mcchesney laughed a little pleased conscious laugh
well rawthah
he drawled and opened the door leading into the main office
he had been loath to lose one crumb of the savor of it
illustration 'well rawthah'
he drawled  still smiling he walked to his own desk with a nod here and there dropped his bag took off coat and hat selected a cigarette tapped it smartly lighted it and was off down the big room to the little cubbyhole at the other end
but sam hupp's plump keen goodhumored face did not greet him as he entered
the little room was deserted
frowning jock sank into the empty desk chair
he cradled his head in his hands tilted the chair pursed his mouth over the slender white cylinder and squinted his eyes up toward the lazy blue spirals of smokethe very picture of content and satisfaction
hupp was in attending some conference in the old man's office of course
he wished they'd hurry
the business of the week was being boileddown there
those conferences were great cauldrons into which the day's business or the week's was dumped to be boiled simmered stirred skimmed cooled
jock had never been privileged to attend one of these meetings
perhaps by this time next week he might have a spoon in the stirring too  there came the murmur of voices as a door was opened
the voices came nearer
then quick footsteps
jock recognized them
he rose smiling
sam hupp vibrating electric energy breezed in
ohhello
he said surprised
jock's smile widened to a grin
you back
hello hupp he said coolly
it was the first time that he had omitted the prefix
you just bet i'm back
there flashed across sam hupp's face a curious little look
the next instant it was gone
well said jock and took a long breath
mr berg wants to see you
hupp plunged into his work
me
the old man wants to see me
yes snapped hupp shortly
then in a new tone look here son
if he says he stopped and turned back to his work again
if he says what
nothing
better run along
what's the hurry
i want to tell you about  better tell him
oh all right said jock stiffly
if that was the way they treated a fellow who had turned his first real trick why very well
he flung out of the little room and made straight for the old man's office
seated at his great flat table desk bartholomew berg did not look up as jock entered
this was characteristic of the old man
everything about the chief was deliberate sure unhurried
he finished the work in hand as though no other person stood there waiting his pleasure
when at last he raised his massive head he turned his penetrating pale blue eyes full on jock
jock was conscious of a little tremor running through him
people were apt to experience that feeling when that steady unblinking gaze was turned upon them
and yet it was just the clear unwavering look with which bartholomew berg farmer boy had been wont to gaze out across the freshplowed fields to the horizon beyond which lay the city he dreamed about
tell me your side of it said bartholomew berg tersely
all of it
jock's confidence was returning
till i stop you
well began jock
and standing there at the side of the old man's desk his legs wide apart his face aglow his hands on his hips he plunged into his tale
it started off with a bang from the minute i walked into the office of the plant and met snyder the advertising manager
we shook hands and sparkedjust like that
he snapped thumb and finger
what do you think
we belong to the same frat
he's '
inside of ten minutes he and i were siwashing around like mad
he introduced me to his aunt
i told her who i was and all that
but i didn't start off by talking business
we got along from the jump
they both insisted on showing me through the place
iwellhe laughed a little ruefullythere's something about being shown through a factory that sort of paralyzes my brain
i always feel that i ought to be asking keen alert intelligent questions like the ones kipling always asks or the japs when they're taken through the stock yards
but i never can think of any
well we didn't talk business much
but i could see that they were interested
they seemed tohe faltered and blushed a littleto like me you know
i played golf with snyder that afternoon and he beat me
won two balls
the next morning i found there's been a couple of other advertising men there
and while i was talking to snyderhe was telling me about the time he climbed up and muffled the chapel bellthat fellow flynn of the dowd agency came in
snyder excused himself and talked to him foroh half an hour perhaps
but that was all
he was back again in no time
after that it looked like plain sailing
we got along wonderfully
when i left i said 'i expect to know you both better'  i guess interrupted the old man slowly that you'll know them better all right
he reached out with one broad freckled hand and turned back the page of a desk memorandum
the athena account was given to the dowd advertising agency yesterday
it took jock mcchesney one minuteone long sickening minuteto grasp the full meaning of it all
he stared at the massive figure before him his mouth ludicrously open his eyes round his breath for the moment suspended
then in a queer husky voice  d'you meanthe dowdbutthey couldn't  i mean said bartholomew berg that you've scored what the dramatic critics call a personal hit but that doesn't get the box office anything
but mr berg they said  sit down a minute boy
he waved one great heavy hand toward a nearby chair
his eyes were not fixed on jock
they gazed out of the window toward the great white tower toward which hundreds of thousands of eyes were turned dailythe tower fourfaced but faithful
mcchesney do you know why you fell down on that athena account
because i'm an idiot blurted jock
because i'm a doublebarreled cornfed handpicked chump and  that's one reason drawled the old man grimly
but it's not the chief one
the real reason why you didn't land that account was because you're too darned charming
charming
jock stared
just that
personality's one of the biggest factors in business today
but there are some men who are so likable that it actually counts against them
the client he's trying to convince is so taken with him that he actually forgets the business he represents
we say of a man like that that he is personality plus
personality is like electricity mcchesney
it's got to be tamed to be useful
but i thought said jock miserably that the idea was not to talk business all the time
you've got it agreed berg
but you must think it all the time
every minute
it's got to be working away in the back of your head
you know it isn't always the biggest noise that gets the biggest result
the great american hen yields a bigger income than the steel trust
look at miss galt
when we have a job that needs a woman's eye do we send her
no
why
because she's too blame charming
too much personality
a man just naturally refuses to talk business to a pretty woman unless she's so smart that  my mother interrupted jock suddenly and then stopped surprised at himself
your mother said bartholomew berg slowly is one woman in a million
don't ever forget that
they don't turn out models like emma mcchesney more than once every blue moon
jock got to his feet slowly
he felt heavy old
i suppose he began that this ends mymy advertising career
ends it
the old man stood up and put a heavy hand on the boy's shoulder
it only begins it
unless you want to lie down and quit
do you
quit
cried jock mcchesney
quit
not on your white space
good
said bartholomew berg and took jock mcchesney's hand in his own great friendly grasp
an instinct as strong as that which had made him blatant in his hour of triumph now caused him to avoid in his hour of defeat the womenfolk before whom he would fain be a hero
he avoided grace galt all that long dreary afternoon
he thought wildly of staying downtown for the evening of putting off the meeting with his mother of avoiding the dreaded explanations excuses confessions
but when he let himself into the flat at fivethirty the place was very quiet except for annie humming in a sort of nasal singsong of content in the kitchen
he flicked on the light in the livingroom
a new magazine had come
it lay on the table its bright cover staring up invitingly
he ran through its pages
by force of habit he turned to the back pages
ads started back at himclothing ads paint ads motor ads ads of portable houses and vacuum cleanersand toilette preparations
he shut the magazine with a vicious slap
he flicked off the light again for no reason except that he seemed to like the dusk
in his own bedroom it was very quiet
he turned on the light there too then turned it off
he sat down at the edge of his bed
how was it in the stories
oh yes
the cub always started out on an impossibly difficult business stunt and came back triumphant to be made a member of the firm at once
a vision of his own roseate hopes and dreams rose up before him
it grew very dark in the little room then altogether dark
then an impudent square of yellow from a light turned on in the apartment next door flung itself on the bedroom floor
jock stared at it moodily
a key turned in the lock
a door opened and shut
a quick step
then jock
a light flashed in the livingroom
jock sat up suddenly
he opened his mouth to answer
there issued from his throat a strange and absurd little croak
jock
home
yes answered jock and straightened up
but before he could flick on his own light his mother stood in the doorway a tall straight buoyant figure
i got your wire andwhy dear
in the dark
what  must have fallen asleep i guess muttered jock
somehow he dreaded to turn on the lights
and then very quietly emma mcchesney came in
she found him there in the dark as surely as a mother bear finds her cubs in a cave
she sat down beside him at the edge of the bed and put her hand on his shoulder and brought his head down gently to her breast
and at that the room which had been a man's room with its pipe its tobacco jar its tie rack filled with cravats of fascinating shapes and hues became all at once a boy's room again and the man sitting there with straight strong shoulders and his little air of worldliness became in some miraculous way a little boy again
illustration  became in some miraculous way a little boy   again     iii  dictated but not read   about the time that jock mcchesney began to carry a yellow walkingstick down to work each morning his mother noticed a growing tendency on his part to patronize her
now mrs emma mcchesney successful capable business woman that she was could afford to regard her young son's attitude with a quiet and deep amusement
in twelve years emma mcchesney had risen from the humble position of stenographer in the office of the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company to the secretaryship of the firm
so when her young son backed by the profound business knowledge gained in his one year with the berg shriner advertising company hinted gently that her methods and training were archaic ineffectual and lacking in those twin condiments known to the twentieth century as pep and ginger she would listen eyebrows raised lower lip caught between her teetha trick which gives a distorted expression to the features calculated to hide any lurking tendency to grin
besides though emma mcchesney was forty she looked thirtytwo as business women do and knew it
her hardworking life had brought her in contact with people and things and events and had kept her young
illustration jock mcchesney began to carry a yellow   walkingstick down to work  thank fortune
mrs mcchesney often said that i wasn't cursed with a life of ease
these massageattenfittingatelevenbridgeatone women always look such hags at thirtyfive
but repetition will ruin the rarest of jokes
as the weeks went on and jock's attitude persisted the twinkle in emma mcchesney's eye died
the glow of growing resentment began to burn in its place
now and then there crept into her eyes a little look of doubt and bewilderment
you sometimes see that same little shocked dazed expression in the eyes of a woman whose husband has just said isn't that hat too young for you
then one evening emma mcchesney's resentment flared into open revolt
she had announced that she intended to rise half an hour earlier each morning in order that she might walk a brisk mile or so on her way downtown before taking the subway
but won't it tire you too much mother
jock had asked with maddeningly tender solicitude
his mother's color heightened
her blue eyes glowed dark
look here jock
will you kindly stop this leanonmegrandma stuff
to hear you talk one would think i was ready for a wheel chair and gray woolen bedroom slippers
why i didn't meani only thought that perhaps overexertion in a woman of yourthat is you need your energy for  don't wallow around in it snapped emma mcchesney
you'll only sink in deeper in your efforts to crawl out
i merely want to warn you that if you persist in this pose of tender solicitude for your doddering old mother i'lli'll present you with a stepfather a year younger than you
don't laugh
perhaps you think i couldn't do it
good lord mother
of course you don't mean it but  mean it
cleverer women than i have been driven by their children to marrying bellboys in selfdefense
i warn you
illustration 'good lord mother
of course you don't   mean it but'  that stopped itfor a while
jock ceased to bestow upon his mother judicious advice from the vast storehouse of his own experience
he refrained from breaking out with elaborate advertising schemes whereby the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company might grind every other skirt concern to dust
he gave only a startled look when his mother mischievously suggested raspberry as the color for her new autumn suit
then quite suddenly circumstance caught emma mcchesney in the meshes and before she had fought her way free wrought trouble and change upon her
jock mcchesney was seated in the window of his mother's office at noon of a brilliant autumn day
a little impatient frown was forming between his eyes
he wanted his luncheon
he had called around expressly to take his mother out to luncheonalways a festive occasion when taken together
but mrs mcchesney seated at her desk was bent absorbedly over a sheet of paper whereon she was adding up two columns of figures at a timea trick on which she rather prided herself
she was counting aloud her mind leaping agilely thus  eleven twentynine fortythree sixty sixtynine her pencil came down on the desk with a thwack
sixtynine
she repeated in capital letters
she turned around to face jock
sixtynine
her voice bristled with indignation
now what do you think of that
i think you'd better make it an even seventy whatever it is you're counting up and come on out to luncheon
i've an appointment at twofifteen you know
luncheon
she waved the paper in the airwith this outrage on my mind
nectar would curdle in my system
jock rose and strolled lazily over to the desk
what is it
he glanced idly at the sheet of paper
sixtynine what
mrs mcchesney pressed a buzzer at the side of her desk
sixtynine dollars that's what
representing two days' expenses in the six weeks' missionary trip that fat ed meyers just made for us
and in iowa too
when you gave that fellow the job began jock hotly i told you and buck told you that  mrs mcchesney interrupted wearily
yes i know
you'll never have a grander chance to say 'i told you so'
i hired him because he was out of a job and we needed a man who knew the middlewestern trade and then becausewell poor fellow he begged so and promised to keep straight
as though i oughtn't to know that a pinochleandpoker traveling man can never be anything but a pinochleandpoker traveling man  the office door opened as there appeared in answer to the buzzer a very alert very smiling and very tidy office girl
emma mcchesney had tried office boys and found them wanting
tell mr meyers i want to see him
just going out to lunchshe turned like a race horse trembling to be offputting on his overcoat in the front office
shall i  catch him
listen here began jock uncomfortably if you're going to call him perhaps i'd better vanish
to save ed meyers's tender feelings
you don't know him
fat ed meyers could be courtmartialed tried convicted and publicly disgraced with his epaulets torn off and his sword broken and likely as not he'd stoop down pick up a splinter of steel to use as a toothpick and castlewalk down the aisle to the tune with which they were drumming him out of the regiment
stay right here
meyers's explanation ought to be at least amusing if not educating
in the corridor outside could be heard some one blithely humming in the throaty tenor of the fat man
the humming ceased with a last high note as the door opened and there entered fat ed meyers rosy cherubic smiling his huge frame looming mountainous in the rippling folds of a loosehung london plaid topcoat
greetings
boomed this cheery vision raising one hand palm outward in mystic salute
he beamed upon the frowning jock
how's the infant prodigy
the fact that jock's frown deepened to a scowl ruffled him not at all
and what went on he crossing his feet and leaning negligently against mrs mcchesney's desk and what can i do for thee fair lady
illustration 'greetings'
for me
said emma mcchesney looking up at him through narrowed eyelids
i'll tell you what
you can explain to me in what they call a few wellchosen words just how you or any other living creature could manage to turn in an expense account like that on a sixweeks' missionary trip through the middle west
dear ladyin the bland tones that one uses to an unreasonable childyou will need no explanation if you will just remember to lay the stress on the word missionary
i went forth through the middle west to spread the light among the benighted skirt trade
this wasn't a selling trip dear lady
it was a buying expedition
and i had to buy didn't i
all the way from michigan to indiana
he smiled down at her calm selfassured impudent
a little flush grew in emma mcchesney's cheeks
i've always said she began crisply that one could pretty well judge a man's character temperament morals and physical makeup by just glancing at his expense account
the trouble with you is that you haven't learned the art of spending money wisely
it isn't always the man with the largest expense sheet that gets the most business
and it isn't the man who leaves the greatest number of circles on the table top in his hotel room either
she paused a moment
ed meyers's smile had lost some of its heartiness
mr buck's out of town as you know
he'll be back next week
he wasn't in favor of  now mrs mcchesney interrupted ed meyers nervously you know there's always one live one in every firm just like there's always one star in every family
you're the  i'm the one who wants to know how you could spend sixtynine dollars for two days' incidentals in iowa
iowa
why look here ed meyers i made iowa for ten years when i was on the road
you know that
and you know and i know that in order to spend sixtynine dollars for incidentals in two days in iowa you have to call out the militia
not when you're trying to win the love of every skirt buyer from sioux city to des moines
emma mcchesney rose impatiently
oh that's nonsense
you don't need to do that these days
those are oldfashioned methods
they're out of date
they  at that a little sound came from jock
emma heard it glanced at him turned away again in confusion
i was foolish enough in the first place to give you this job for old times' sake she continued hurriedly
fat ed meyers' face drooped dolefully
he cocked his round head on one side fatuously
for old times' sake he repeated with tremulous pathos and heaved a gusty sigh
which goes to show that i need a guardian finished emma mcchesney cruelly
the only old times that i can remember are when i was selling featherlooms and you were out for the sanssilk skirt company both covering the same territory and both running a yeararound race to see which could beat the other at his own game
the only difference was that i always played fair while you played lowdown whenever you had a chance
now my dear mrs mcchesney  that'll be all said emma mcchesney as one whose patience is fast slipping away
mr buck will see you next week
then turning to her son as the door closed on the drooping figure of the erstwhile buoyant meyers where'll we lunch jock
mother jock broke out hotly why in the name of all that's foolish do you persist in using the methods of methuselah
people don't sell goods any more by sending out fat old extraveling men to jolly up the trade
jock repeated emma mcchesney slowly whereshallwelunch
it was a grim little meal eaten almost in silence
emma mcchesney had made it a rule to use luncheon time as a recess
she played mental tag and hopscotch so that returning to her office refreshed in mind and body she could attack the afternoon's work with new vigor
and never did she talk or think business
today she ate her luncheon with a forced appetite glanced about with a listlessness far removed from her usual alert interest and followed jock's attempts at conversation with a polite effort that was more insulting than downright inattention
dessert mother
jock had to say it twice before she heard
what
oh noi think not
the waiter hesitated coughed discreetly lifted his eyebrows insinuatingly
the french pastry's particularly nice today madam
if you'd care to try something
eclair madampeach tartmocha tartcaramel  emma mcchesney smiled
it does sound tempting
she glanced at jock
and we're wearing our gowns so floppy this year that it makes no difference whether one's fat or not
she turned to the waiter
i never can tell till i see them
bring your pastry tray will you
jock mcchesney's finger and thumb came together with a snap
he leaned across the table toward his mother eyes glowing lips parted and eager
there
you've proved my point
point
about advertising
no don't stop me
don't you see that what applies to pastry applies to petticoats
you didn't think of french pastry until he suggested it to youadvertised it really
and then you wanted a picture of them
you wanted to know what they looked like before buying
that's all there is to advertising
telling people about a thing making 'em want it and showing 'em how it will look when they have it
get me
emma mcchesney was gazing at jock with a curious fascinated stare
it was a blank little look such as we sometimes wear when the mind is working furiously
if the insinuating waiter presenting the laden tray for her inspection was startled by the rapt expression which she turned upon the cunningly wrought wares he was too much a waiter to show it
a pause
that one said mrs mcchesney pointing to the least ornate
she ate it down to the last crumb in a silence that was pregnant with portent
she put down her fork and sat back
jock you win
ii suppose i have fallen out of step
perhaps i've been too busy watching my own feet
ta
will be back next week
could your office have an advertising plan roughly sketched by that time
could they
his tone was exultant
watch 'em
hupp's been crazy to make featherlooms famous
but look here son
i want a hand in that copy
i know featherlooms better than your sam hupp will ever  jock shook his head
they won't stand for that mother
it never works
the manufacturer always thinks he can write magic stuff because he knows his own product
but he never can
you see he knows too much
that's it
no perspective
we'll see said emma mcchesney curtly
so it was that ten days later the first important conference in the interests of the featherloom petticoat company's advertising campaign was called
but in those ten days of hurried preparation a little silent tragedy had come about
for the first time in her brave sunny life emma mcchesney had lost faith in herself
and with such malicious humor does fate work her will that she chose sam hupp's new dictagraph as the instrument with which to prick the bubble of mrs mcchesney's selfconfidence
sam hupp one of the copywriting marvels of the berg shriner firm had a trick of forgetting to shut off certain necessary currents when he paused in his dictation to throw in conversational asides
the old and experienced stenographers had learned to look out for that and to eliminate from their typewritten letters certain irrelevant and sometimes irreverent asides which sam hupp evidently had addressed to his pipe or the office boy and not intended for the tube of the alldevouring dictagraph
there was a new and nervous little stenographer in the outer office and she had not been warned of this
we think very highly of the plan you suggest sam hupp had said into the dictagraph's mouthpiece
in fact in one of your valuable copy suggestions you  without changing his tone he glanced over his shoulder at his colleague hopper who was listening and approving
 let the old girl think the idea is her own
she's virtually the head of that concern and they've spoiled her
successful and used to being kowtowed to
doesn't know her notions of copy are ten years behind the advertising game  and went on with his letter again
after which he left the office to play golf
and the little blond numbskull in the outer office dutifully took down what the instrument had to say word for word marked it dictated but not read signed neat initials and with a sigh went on with the rest of her sheaf of letters
emma mcchesney read the letter next morning
she read it down to the end and then again
the two readings were punctuated with a little gasp such as we give when an icy douche is suddenly turned upon us
and that was all
a week later an intent little group formed a ragged circle about the big table in the private office of bartholomew berg head of the berg shriner advertising company
bartholomew berg himself massive watchful taciturn managing to give an impression of power by his very silence sat at one side of the long table
just across from him a sleekhaired stenographer bent over her note book jotting down every word that the conference might make business history
hopper at one end of the room studied his shoe heel intently
he was unbelievably boyish looking to command the fabulous salary reported to be his
advertising men mentioning his name pulled a figurative forelock as they did so
near mrs mcchesney sat sam hupp he of the lightning brain and the surefire copy
emma mcchesney strangely silent kept her eyes intent on the faces of the others
ta
buck interested enthusiastic but somewhat uncertain glanced now and then at his silent business partner found no satisfaction in her set face and glanced away again
grace galt unbelievably young and pretty to have won a place for herself in that conference of business people smiled in secret at jock mcchesney's evident struggle to conceal his elation at being present at this his first staff meeting
the conference had lasted one hour now
in that time featherloom petticoats had been picked to pieces bit by bit from hem to waistband
nothing had been left untouched
every angle had come under the keen vision of the advertising expertsthe comfort of the garment its durability style cheapness service
which to emphasize
hm novelty campaign in my opinion said hopper breaking one of his long silences
there's nothing new in petticoats themselves you know
you've got to give 'em a new angle
yep agreed hupp
start out with a feature skirt
might illustrate with one of those freak drawings they're crazy about nowslinky figure you know hollowchested one foot trailing and all that
they're crazy but they do attract attention no doubt of that
bartholomew berg turned his head slowly
what's your opinion mrs
mcchesney
he asked
ii'm afraid i haven't any said emma mcchesney listlessly
ta
buck stared at her in dismay and amazement
how about you mr
buck
whyierof course this advertising game's new to me
i'm really leaving it in your hands
i really thought that mrs mcchesney's idea was to make a point of the fact that these petticoats were not freak petticoats but skirts for the everyday women
she gave me what i thought was a splendid argument a week ago
he turned to her helplessly
mrs mcchesney sat silent
bartholomew berg leaned forward a little and smiled one of his rare smiles
won't you tell us mrs mcchesney
we'd all like to hear what you have to say
mrs mcchesney looked down at her hands
then she looked up and addressed what she had to say straight to bartholomew berg
isimply didn't want to interfere in this business
i know nothing about it really
of course i do know featherloom petticoats
i know all about them
it seemed to me that just because the newspapers and magazines were full of pictures showing spectacular creatures in impossible attitudes wearing tango tea skirts we are apt to forget that those types form only a thin upper crust and that down beneath there are millions and millions of regular everyday women doing regular everyday things in regular everyday clothes
women who wash on monday and iron on tuesday and bake oneegg cakes and who have to hurry home to get supper when they go downtown in the afternoon
they're the kind who go to market every morning and take the baby along in the gocart and they're not wearing crpe de chine tango petticoats to do it in either
they're wearing skirts with a drawstring in the back and a label in the band guaranteed to last one year
those are the people i'd like to reach and hold
hm
said hopper from his corner cryptically
bartholomew berg looked at emma mcchesney admiringly
sounds reasonable and logical he said
sam hupp sat up with a jerk
it does sound reasonable he said briskly
but it isn't
pardon me won't you mrs mcchesney
but you must realize that this is an extravagant age
the very workingmen's wives have caught the spending fever
the time is past when you can attract people to your goods with the promise of durability and wear
they don't expect goods to wear
they'd resent it if they did
they get tired of an article before it's worn out
they're looking for novelties
they'd rather get two months' wear out of a skirt that's slashed a new way than a year's wear out of one that looks like the sort that mother used to make
mrs mcchesney her cheeks very pink her eyes very bright subsided into silence
in silence she sat throughout the rest of the conference
in silence she descended in the elevator with ta
buck and in silence she stepped into his waiting car
ta
buck eyed her worriedly
well
he said
then as mrs mcchesney shrugged noncommittal shoulders tell me how do you feel about it
emma mcchesney turned to face him breathing rather quickly
the last time i felt as i do just now was when jock was a baby
he took sick and the doctors were puzzled
they thought it might be something wrong with his spine
they had a consultationfive of themwith the poor little chap on the bed naked
they wouldn't let me in so i listened in the hallway pressed against the door with my face to the crack
they prodded him and poked him and worked his little legs and arms and every time he cried i prayed and wept and clawed the door with my fingers and called them beasts and torturers and begged them to let me in though i wasn't conscious that i was doing those thingsat the time
i didn't know what they were doing to him though they said it was all for his good and they were only trying to help him
but i only knew that i wanted to rush in and grab him up in my arms and run away with himrun and run and run
she stopped lips trembling eyes suspiciously bright
and that's the way i felt in therethis afternoon
ta
buck reached up and patted her shoulder
don't old girl
it's going to work out splendidly i'm sure
after all those chaps do know best
they may know best but they don't know featherlooms retorted emma mcchesney
true
but perhaps what jock said when he walked with us to the elevator was pretty nearly right
you know he said we were criticising their copy the way a plumber would criticise the parthenonso busy finding fault with the lack of drains that we failed to see the beauty of the architecture
ta said emma mcchesney solemnly ta we're getting old
old
you
i
ha
you may 'ha'
all you like
but do you know what they thought of us in there
they thought we were a couple of fogies and they humored us that's what they did
i'll tell you ta when the time comes for me to give jock up to some little pinkfaced girl i'll do it and smile if it kills me
but to hand my featherlooms over to a lot of coldblooded experts whowell she paused biting her lip
we'll see emma we'll see
they did see
the featherloom petticoat campaign was launched with a great splash
it sailed serenely into the sea of national business
then suddenly something seemed to go wrong with its engines
it began to wobble and showed a decided list to port
jock who at the beginning was so puffed with pride that his gold fountain pen threatened to burst the confines of his very modishly tight vest lost two degrees of pompousness a day and his attitude toward his unreproachful mother was almost humble
a dozen times a week ta
buck would stroll casually into mrs mcchesney's office
think it's going to take hold
he would ask
our men say the dealers have laid in but the public doesn't seem to be tearing itself limb from limb to get to our stuff
emma mcchesney would smile and shrug noncommittal shoulders
when it became very painfully apparent that it wasn't taking hold ta
buck after asking the same question now worn and frayed with asking broke out crossly  well really i don't mind the shrug but i do wish you wouldn't smile
after all you know this campaign is costing us moneyreal money and large chunks of it
it's very evident that we shouldn't have tried to make a national campaign of this thing
whereupon mrs mcchesney's smile grew into a laugh
forgive me ta
i'm not laughing at you
i'm laughing becausewell i can't tell you why
it's a woman's reason and you wouldn't think it a reason at all
for that matter i suppose it isn't butanyway i've got something to tell you
the fault of this campaign has been the copy
it was perfectly good advertising but it left the public cold
when they read those ads they might have been impressed with the charm of the garment but it didn't fill their breasts with any wild longing to possess one
it didn't make the women feel unhappy until they had one of those skirts hanging on the third hook in their closet
the only kind of advertising that is advertising is the kind that makes the reader say 'i'll have one of those'
ta
buck threw out helpless hands
what are we going to do about it
do
i've already done it
done what
written the kind of copy that i think featherlooms ought to have
i just took my knowledge of featherlooms plus what i knew about human nature sprinkled in a handful of good humor and sincerity and they're going to feed it to the public
it's the same recipe that i used to use in selling featherlooms on the road
it used to go by word of mouth
i don't see why it shouldn't go on paper
it isn't classic advertising
it isn't scientific
it isn't even what they call psychological i suppose
but it's human
and it's going to reach that great big solid safe spotcash mass known as the middle class
of course my copy may be wrong
it may not go after all but  but it did go
it didn't go with a rush or a bang
it went slowly surely hand over hand but it went and it kept on going
and watching it climb and take hold there came back to emma mcchesney's eye the old sparkle to her step the old buoyancy to her voice the old delightful ring
and now when ta
buck strolled into her office of a morning with his it's taking hold mrs mack she would dimple like a girl as she laughed back at him  with a grip that won't let go
it looks very much as though we were going to be millionaires in our old age you and i
went on buck
emma mcchesney opened her eyes wide
old
she mocked old
you
i
ha
iv  the man within him   they used to do it much more picturesquely
they rode in coats of scarlet in the crisp clear morning to the winding of horns and the baying of hounds to the thudthud of hoofs and the crackle of underbrush
across freshplowed fields they went crashing through forest paths leaping ditches taking fences scrambling up the inclines pelting down the hillside helterskelter until panting wideeyed eager bloodhungry the hunt closed in at the death
the scarlet coat has sobered down to the somber gray and the snuffy brown of that unromantic garment known as the business suit
the winding horn is become a goblet and its notes are the tinkle of ice against glass
the baying of hounds has harshened to the squawk of the motor siren
the freshplowed field is a blue print the forest maze a roll of plans and specifications
each fence is a business barrier
every ditch is of a competitor's making dug craftily so that the clumsyfooted may come a cropper
all the romance is out of it all the color all the joy
but two things remain the same the look in the face of the hunter as he closed in on the fox is the look in the face of him who sees the coveted contract lying ready for the finishing stroke of his pen
and his words are those of the hunter of long ago as eyes agleam teeth bared muscles still taut with the tenseness of the chase he waves the paper high in air and cries i've made a killing
for two years jock mcchesney had watched the field as it swept by in its patient devious cruel game of hunt the contract
but he had never been in at the death
those two years had taught him how to ride to take a fence to leap a ditch
he had had his awkward bumps and his clumsy falls
he had lost his way more than once
but he had always groped his way back again stumblingly through the dusk
jock mcchesney was the youngest man on the berg shriner advertising company's big staff of surprisingly young men
so young that the casual glance did not reveal to you the marks that the strain of those two years had left on his boyish face
but the marks were there
nature etches with the most delicate of points
she knows the cunning secret of light and shadow
you scarcely realize that she has been at work
a faint line about the mouth a fairy tracing at the corners of the eyes a mere vague touch just at the nostrilsand the thing is done
even emma mcchesney's eyesthose mothereyes which make the lynx seem a molehad failed to note the subtle change
then suddenly one night the lines leaped out at her
they were seated at opposite sides of the booklittered library table in the livingroom of the cheerful uptown apartment which was the realization of the nightly dream which mrs emma mcchesney had had in her ten years on the road for the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company
jock mcchesney's side of the big table was completely covered with the mass of copypaper rough sketches photographs and drawings which make up an advertising layout
he was bent over the work absorbed intent his forearms resting on the table
emma mcchesney glanced up from her magazine just as jock bent forward to reach a scrap of paper that had fluttered away
the lamplight fell full on his face
and emma mcchesney saw
the hand that held the magazine fell to her lap
her lips were parted slightly
she sat very quietly her eyes never leaving the face that frowned so intently over the littered table
the room had been very quiet beforejock busy with his work his mother interested in her magazine
but this silence was different
there was something electric in it
it was a silence that beats on the brain like a noise
jock mcchesney bent over his work heard it felt it and oppressed by it looked up suddenly
he met those two eyes opposite
spooks
or is it my godlike beauty which holds you thus
or is my face dirty
emma mcchesney did not smile
she laid her magazine on the table face down and leaned forward her staring eyes still fixed on her son's face
look here young 'un
are you working too hard
me
now
this stuff you mean
no i mean in the last year
are they piling it up on you
jock laughed a laugh that was nothing less than a failure so little of real mirth did it contain
piling it up
lord no
i wish they would
that's the trouble
they don't give me a chance
a chance
why that's not true son
you've said yourself that there are men who have been in the office three times as long as you have who never have had the opportunities that they've given you
it was as though she had touched a current that thrilled him to action
he pushed back his chair and stood up one hand thrust into his pocket the other passing quickly over his head from brow to nape with a quick nervous gesture that was new to him
and why
he flung out
why
not because they like the way i part my hair
they don't do business that way up there
it's because i've made good and those other dubs haven't
that's why
they've let me sit in at the game
but they won't let me take any tricks
i've been an apprentice hand for two years now
i'm tired of it
i want to be in on a killing
i want to taste blood
i want a chance at some of the moneyreal money
emma mcchesney sat back in her chair and surveyed the angry figure before her with quiet steady eyes
i might have known that only one thing could bring those lines into your face son
she paused a moment
so you want money as badly as all that do you
jock's hand came down with a thwack on the papers before him
want it
you just bet i want it
do i know her
asked emma mcchesney quietly
jock stopped short in his excited pacing up and down the room
do you knowwhy i didn't say therewhat makes you think that
when a youngster like you whose greatest worry has been whether harvard'll hold 'em again this year with baxter out begins to howl about not being appreciated in business and to wear a late fall line of wrinkles where he has been smooth before i feel justified in saying 'do i know her'
well it isn't any oneat least it isn't what you mean you think it is when you say you  careful there
you'll trip
never you mind what i mean i think it is when i say
count ten and then just tell me what you think you mean
jock passed his hand over his head again with that nervous little gesture
then he sat down a little wearily
he stared moodily down at the pile of papers before him his mother faced him quietly across the table
grace galt's getting twice as much as i am jock broke out with savage suddenness
the first year i didn't mind
a fellow gets accustomed these days to see women breaking into all the professions and getting away with mensize salaries
but her pay check doubles minemore than doubles it
it's been my experience observed emma mcchesney that when a firm condescends to pay a woman twice as much as a man that means she's worth six times as much
a painful red crept into jock's face
maybe
two years ago that would have sounded reasonable to me
two years ago when i walked down broadway at night a fiftyfoot electric sign at fortysecond was just an electric sign to me
just part of the town's decoration like the chorus girls and the midnight theater crowds
nowwell now every blink of every red and yellow globe is crammed full of meaning
i know the power that advertising has how it influences our manners and our morals and our minds and our health
it regulates the food we eat and the clothes we wear and the books we read and the entertainment we seek
it's colossal that's what it is
it's  keep on like that for another two years sonny and no business banquet will be complete without you
the next thing you know you'll be addressing the ymca
advertising classes on the young man in business
jock laughed a rueful little laugh
i didn't mean to make a speech
i was just trying to say that i've served my apprenticeship
it hurts a fellow's pride
you can't hold your head up before a girl when you know her salary's twice yours and you know that she knows it
why look at mrs hoffman who's with the dowd agency
of course she's a wonder even if her face does look like the fiftyeighth variety
she can write copy that lifts a campaign right out of the humdrum class and makes it luminous
her husband works in a bank somewhere
he earns about as much as mrs hoffman pays the least of her department subordinates
and he's so subdued that he sidesteps when he walks and they call him the human jellyfish
emma mcchesney was regarding her son with a little puzzled frown
suddenly she reached out and tapped the topmost of the scribbled sheets strewn the length of jock's side of the table
what's all this
jock tipped back his chair and surveyed the clutter before him
that said he is what is known on the stage as 'the papers'
and it's the real plot of this piece
mmmi thought so
just favor me with a scenario will you
halfgrinning halfserious jock stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and began
scene offices of the berg shriner advertising company
time the present
characters jock mcchesney handsome daring brilliant  suppose youerskip the characters however fascinating and get to the action
jock mcchesney brought the tipped chair down on allfours with a thud and stood up
the grin was gone
he was as serious as he had been in the midst of his tirade of five minutes before
all right
here it is
and don't blame me if it sounds like cheap melodrama
this stuff and he waved a hand toward the paperladen table is an advertising campaign plan for the griebler gum company of st louis
oh don't look impressed
the office hasn't handed me any such commission
i just got the idea like a flash and i've been working it out for the last two weeks
it worked itself out almostthe way a really scorching idea does sometimes
this griebler has been advertising for years
you know the griebler gum
but it hasn't been the right sort of advertising
old griebler the original gum man had fogy notions about advertising and as long as he lived they had to keep it down
he died a few months agoyou must have read of it
left a regular mint
ben griebler the oldest son started right in to clean out the cobwebs
of course the advertising end of it has come in for its share of the soap and water
he wants to make a clean sweep of it
every advertising firm in the country has been angling for the contract
it's going to be a real one
twothirds of the crowd have submitted plans
and that's just where my kick comes in
the berg shriner company makes it a rule never to submit advance plans
excuse me if i seem a trifle rude interrupted mrs mcchesney but i'd like to know where you think you've been wronged in this
right here
replied jock and he slapped his pocket and here he pointed to his head
two spots so vital that they make old achilles's heel seem armorplated
ben griebler is one of the showme kind
he wants value received for money expended and while everybody knows that he has a loving eye on the berg shriner crowd he won't sign a thing until he knows what he's getting
a firm's record standing staff equipment mean nothing to him
but jock i still don't see  jock gathered up a sheaf of loose papers and brandished them in the air
this is where i come in
i've got a plan here that will fetch this griebler person
oh i'm not dreaming
i outlined it for sam hupp and he was crazy about it
sam hupp had some sort of plan outlined himself
but he said this made his sound as dry as cigars in denver
and you know yourself that sam hupp's copy is so brilliant that he could sell brewery advertising to a temperance magazine
emma mcchesney stood up
she looked a little impatient and a trifle puzzled
but why all this talk
i don't get you
take your plan to mr berg
if it's what you think it is he'll see it quicker than any other human being and he'll probably fall on your neck and invest you in royal robes and give you a mahogany desk all your own
oh what's the good
retorted jock disgustedly
this griebler has an appointment at the office tomorrow
he'll be closeted with the old man
they'll call in hupp
but never a plan will they reveal
it's against their code of ethics
ethics
i'm sick of the word
i suppose you'd say i'm lucky to be associated with a firm like that and i suppose i am
but i wish in the name of all the gods of business that they weren't so bloomin' conservative
ethics
they're all balled up in 'em like henry james in his style
emma mcchesney came over from her side of the table and stood very close to her son
she laid one hand very lightly on his arm and looked up into the sullen angry young face
illustration she laid one hand very lightly on his arm and   looked up into the sullen angry young face  i've seen older men than you are jock and better men and bigger men wearing that same look and for the same reason
every ambitious man or woman in business wears it at one time or another
sooner or later jock you'll have your chance at the money end of this game
if you don't care about the thing you call ethics it'll be sooner
if you do care it will be later
it rests with you but it's bound to come because you've got the stuff in you
maybe replied jock the cynical
but his face lost some of its sullenness as he looked down at that earnest vivid countenance upturned to his
maybe
it sounds all right motherin the story books
but i'm not quite solid on it
these days it isn't so much what you've got in you that counts as what you can bring out
i know the young man's slogan used to be 'work and wait' or something pretty like that
but these days they've boiled it down to one word'produce'
the marvel of it is that there aren't more of 'em observed emma mcchesney sadly
more what
more lines
hereshe touched his foreheadand hereshe touched his eyes
lines
jock swung to face a mirror
good
i'm so infernally younglooking that no one takes me seriously
it's darned hard trying to convince people you're a captain of finance when you look like an errand boy
from the center of the room mrs mcchesney watched the boy as he surveyed himself in the glass
and as she gazed there came a frightened look into her eyes
it was gone in a minute and in its place came a curious little gleam half amused half pugnacious
jock mcchesney if i thought that you meant half of what you've said tonight about honor and ethics and all that i'd  spank me i suppose said the young sixfooter
no and all the humor had fled ijock i've never said much to you about your father
but i think you know that he was what he was to the day of his death
you were just about eight when i made up my mind that life with him was impossible
i said thenand you were all i had sonthat i'd rather see you dead than to have you turn out to be a son of your father
don't make me remember that wish jock
two quick steps and his arms were about her
his face was all contrition
whymother
i didn't meanyou see this is business and i'm crazy to make good and it's such a fight  don't i know it
demanded emma mcchesney
i guess your mother hasn't been sitting home embroidering lunchcloths these last fifteen years
she lifted her head from the boy's shoulder
and now son considering me not as your doting mother but in my business capacity as secretary of the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company suppose you reveal to me the inner workings of this plan of yours
i'd like to know if you really are the advertising wizard that you think you are
so it was that long after annie's dinner dishes had ceased to clatter in the kitchen long after she had put her head in at the door to ask aigs 'r cakes for breakfast
long after those two busy brains should have rested in sleep the two sat at either side of the lightflooded table the face of one glowing as he talked the face of the other sparkling as she listened
and at midnight  why you infant wonder
exclaimed emma mcchesney
at nine o'clock next morning when jock mcchesney entered the offices of the berg shriner advertising company he carried a flat compact bundle of papers under his arm encased in protecting covers of pasteboard and further secured by bands of elastic
this he carried to his desk deposited in a drawer and locked the drawer
by eleven o'clock the things which he had predicted the night before had come to pass
a plump little man with a fussy manner and western clothes had been ushered into bartholomew berg's private office
instinct told him that this was griebler
jock left his desk and strolled up to get the switchboard operator's confirmation of his guess
half an hour later sam hupp hustled by and disappeared into the old man's sanctum
jock fingered the upper lefthand drawer of his desk
the maddening blankness of that closed door
if only he could find some excuse for walking into that roomany old excuse no matter how wildjust to get a chance at it  his telephone rang
he picked up the receiver his eye on the closed door his thoughts inside that room
mr berg wants to see you right away came the voice of the switchboard operator
something seemed to give way insidesomething in the region of his brainno his heartno his lungs  well can you beat that
said jock mcchesney aloud in a kind of trance of joy
canyoubeatthat
then he buttoned the lower button of his coat shrugged his shoulders with an extra wriggle at the collar the modern hero's method of girding up his loins and walked calmly into bartholomew berg's very private office
in the second that elapsed between the opening and the closing of the door jock's glance swept the three menbartholomew berg quiet inscrutable seated at his great tabledesk griebler lost in the depths of a great leather chair smoking fussily and twitching with a hundred little restless irritating gestures sam hupp standing at the opposite side of the room hands in pockets attitude argumentative
this is mr mcchesney said bartholomew berg
mr griebler mcchesney
jock came forward smiling that charming smile of his
mr griebler he said extending his hand this is a great pleasure
hm
growled ben griebler i didn't know they picked 'em so young
his voice was a piping falsetto that somehow seemed to match his restless little eyes
jock thrust his hands hurriedly into his pockets
he felt his face getting scarlet
they'reahusing 'em young this year said bartholomew berg
his voice sounded bigger and smoother and pleasanter than ever in contrast with that other's shrill tone
i prefer 'em young myself
you'll never catch mcchesney using 'in the last analysis' to drive home an argument
he has a new idea about every nineteen minutes and every other one's a good one and every nineteenth or so's an inspiration
the old man laughed one of his low chuckling laughs
hmthat so
piped ben griebler
up in my neck of the woods we aren't so long on inspiration
we're just working men and we wear working clothes  oh now protested berg his eyes twinkling mcchesney's necktie and socks and handkerchief may form one lovely blissful color scheme but that doesn't signify that his advertising schemes are not just as carefully and artistically blended
ben griebler looked shrewdly up at jock through narrowed lids
maybe
i'll talk to you in a minute young manthat is he turned quickly upon bergif that isn't against your crazy principles too
why not at all bartholomew berg assured him
not at all
you do me an injustice
griebler moved up closer to the broad table
the two fell into a lowvoiced talk
jock looked rather helplessly around at sam hupp
that alert gentleman was signaling him frantically with head and wagging finger
jock crossed the big room to hupp's side
the two moved off to a window at the far end
give heed to your unkie said sam hupp talking very rapidly very softly and out of one corner of his mouth
this griebler's looking for an advertising manager
he's as pigheaded as aawell as a pig i suppose
but it's a corking chance youngster and the old man's just recommended youstrong
now  me
exploded jock
shut up
hissed hupp
two or three years with that firm would be the making of youif you made good of course
and you could
they want to move their factory here from st louis within the next few years
now listen
when he talks to you you play up the keen alert stuff with a dash of sophistication see
if you can keep your mouth shut and throw a kind of a canny igetyou look into your eyes all the better
he's gabby enough for two
try a line of talk that is filled with the fire and enthusiasm of youth combined with the good judgment and experience of middle age and you've  say look here stammered jock
even if i was warfield enough to do all that d'you honestly thinkme an advertising managerwith a salary that griebler  you nervy little shrimp go in and win
he'll pay five thousand if he pays a cent
but he wants value for money expended
now i've tipped you off
you make your killing  oh mcchesney
called bartholomew berg glancing round
yes sir
said jock and stood before him in the same moment
mr griebler is looking for a competent enthusiastic hardworking man as advertising manager
i've spoken to him of you
i know what you can do
mr griebler might trust my judgment in this but  i'll trust my own judgment snapped ben griebler
it's good enough for me
very well returned bartholomew berg suavely
and if you decide to place your advertising future in the hands of the berg shriner company  now look here interrupted ben griebler again
i'll tie up with you people when you've shaken something out of your cuffs
i'm not the kind that buys a pig in a poke
we're going to spend moneyreal moneyin this campaign of ours
but i'm not such a comeon as to hand you half a million or so and get a promise in return
i want your plans and i want 'em in full
a little exclamation broke from sam hupp
he checked it but not before berg's curiously penetrating pale blue eyes had glanced up at him and away again
i've told you mr griebler went on bartholomew berg's patient voice just why the thing you insist on is impossible
this firm does not submit advance copy
every business commission that comes to us is given all the skill and thought and enthusiasm and careful planning that this office is capable of
you know our record
this is a business of ideas
and ideas are too precious too perishable to spread in the market place for all to see
ben griebler stood up
his cigar waggled furiously between his lips as he talked
i know something else that don't stand spreading in the market place berg
and that's money
it's too darned perishable too
he pointed a stubby finger at jock
does this fool rule of yours apply to this young fellow too
bartholomew berg seemed to grow more patient more selfcontained as the other man's selfcontrol slipped rapidly away
it goes for every man and woman in this office mr griebler
this young chap mcchesney here might spend weeks and months building up a comprehensive advertising plan for you
he'd spend those weeks studying your business from every possible angle
perhaps it would be a plan that would require a year of waiting before the actual advertising began to appear
and then you might lose faith in the plan
a waiting game is a hard game to play
some other man's idea that promised quicker action might appeal to you
and when it appeared we'd very likely find our own original idea incorporated in  say look here
squeaked ben griebler his face dully red
d'you mean to imply that i'd steal your plan
d'you mean to sit there and tell me to my face  mr griebler i mean that that thing happens constantly in this business
we're almost powerless to stop it
nothing spreads quicker than a new idea
compared to it a woman's secret is a sealed book
ben griebler removed the cigar from his lips
he was stuttering with anger
with a mingling of despair and boldness jock saw the advantage of that stuttering moment and seized on it
he stepped close to the broad tabledesk resting both hands on it and leaning forward slightly in his eagerness
mr bergi have a plan
mr hupp can tell you
it came to me when i first heard that the grieblers were going to broaden out
it's a real idea
i'm sure of that
i've worked it out in detail
mr hupp himself said itwhy i've got the actual copy
and it's new
absolutely
it never  trot it out
shouted ben griebler
i'd like to see one idea anyway around this shop
mcchesney said bartholomew berg not raising his voice
his eyes rested on jock with the steady penetrating gaze that was peculiar to him
more foolhardy men than jock mcchesney had faltered and paused abashed under those eyes
mcchesney your enthusiasm for your work is causing you to forget one thing that must never be forgotten in this office
jock stepped back
his lower lip was caught between his teeth
at the same moment ben griebler snatched up his hat from the table clapped it on his head at an absurd angle and bristling like a fighting cock confronted the three men
i've got a couple of rules myself he cried and don't you forget it
when you get a little spare time you look up st louis and find out what state it's in
the slogan of that state is my slogan you bet
if you think i'm going to make you a present of the money that it took my old man fifty years to pile up then you don't know that griebler is a german name
good day gents
he stalked to the door
there he turned dramatically and leveled a forefinger at jock
they've got you roped and tied
but i think you're a comer
if you change your mind kid come and see me
the door slammed behind him
whew
whistled sam hupp passing a handkerchief over his bald spot
bartholomew berg reached out with one great capable hand and swept toward him a pile of papers
oh well you can't blame him
advertising has been a scream for so long
griebler doesn't know the difference between advertising publicity and bunk
he'll learn
but it'll be an awfully expensive course
now hupp let's go over this kalamazoo account
that'll be all mcchesney
jock turned without a word
he walked quickly through the outer office into the great main room
there he stopped at the switchboard
ermiss grimes he said smiling charmingly
where's this mr griebler of st louis stopping do you know
say where would he stop
retorted the wise miss grimes
look at him
the waldorf of course
thanks said jock still smiling
and went back to his desk
at five jock left the office
under his arm he carried the flat pasteboard package secured by elastic bands
at fivefifteen he walked swiftly down the famous corridor of the great red stone hotel
the colorful glittering crowd that surged all about him he seemed not to see
he made straight for the main desk with its battalion of clerks
illustration he made straight for the main desk with its   battalion of clerks  mr griebler in
mr ben griebler st
louis
the question set in motion the hotel's elaborate system of investigation
at last not in
do you know when he will be in
that futile question
can't say
he left no word
do you want to leave your name
nno
would hedoes he stop at this desk when he comes in
he was an unusually urbane hotel clerk
why usually they leave their keys and get their mail from the floor clerk
but mr griebler seems to prefer the main desk
i'llwait said jock
and seated in one of the great thronelike chairs he waited
he sat there slim and boyish while the laughing chattering crowd swept all about him
if you sit long enough in that foyer you will learn all there is to learn about life
an amazing sight it isthat crowd
baraboo helps swell it and spokane and berlin and budapest and pekin and paris and waco texas
so varied it is so cosmopolitan that if you sit there patiently enough and watch sharply enough you will even see a chance new yorker
from door to desk jock's eyes swept
the afternoontea crowd in paradise feathers and furs and frock coats swam back and forth
he saw it give way to the dinner throng satinshod bejeweled hurrying through its oysters swallowing unbelievable numbers of cloudyamber drinks and goldenbrown drinks and maroon drinks then gathering up its furs and rushing theaterwards
he was still sitting there when that crowd its eight o'clock freshness somewhat sullied its sparkle a trifle dimmed swept back for more oysters more cloudyamber and goldenbrown drinks
at halfhour intervals then at hourly intervals the figure in the great chair stirred rose and walked to the desk
has mr griebler come in
the supper throng its laugh a little ribald its talk a shade highpitched drifted towards the street or was wafted up in elevators
the throng thinned to an occasional group
then these became rarer and rarer
the revolving door admitted one man or two perhaps who lingered not at all in the unaccustomed quiet of the great glittering lobby
the figure of the watcher took on a pathetic droop
the eyelids grew leaden
to open them meant an almost superhuman effort
the stare of the new night clerks grew more and more hostile and suspicious
a grayish pallor had settled down on the boy's face
and those lines of the night before stood out for all to see
in the stillness of the place the big revolving door turned once more complainingly
for the thousandth time jock's eyes lifted heavily
then they flew wide open
the drooping figure straightened electrically
half a dozen quick steps and jock stood in the pathway of ben griebler who rather ruffled and untidy had blown in on the wings of the morning
he stared a moment
well what  i've been waiting for you here since five o'clock last evening
it will soon be five o'clock again
will you let me show you those plans now
ben griebler had surveyed jock with the stony calm of the outoftown visitor who is prepared to show surprise at nothing in new york
there's nothing like getting an early start said ben griebler
come on up to my room
key in hand he made for the elevator
for an almost imperceptible moment jock paused
then with a little rush he followed the short thickset figure
i knew you had it in you mcchesney
i said you looked like a comer didn't i
jock said nothing
he was silent while griebler unlocked his door turned on the light fumbled at the windows and shades picked up the telephone receiver
what'll you have
nothing
jock had cleared the center table and was opening his flat bundle of papers
he drew up two chairs
let's not waste any time he said
i've had a twelvehour wait for this
he seemed to control the situation
obediently ben griebler hung up the receiver came over and took the chair very close to jock
illustration 'let's not waste any time' he said  there's nothing artistic about gum began jock mcchesney and his manner was that of a man who is sure of himself
it's a shirtsleeve product and it ought to be handled from a shirtsleeve standpoint
every gum concern in the country has spent thousands on a 'betterthancandy' campaign before it realized that gum is a candy and drug store article and that no man is going to push a fivecent package of gum at the sacrifice of the sale of an eightycent box of candy
but the health note is there if only you strike it right
now here's my idea  at six o'clock ben griebler his little shrewd eyes sparkling his voice more squeakily falsetto than ever surveyed the youngster before him with a certain awe
thisthis thing will actually sell our stuff in europe
no gum concern has ever been able to make the stuff go outside of this country
why inside of three years every 'arry and 'arriet in england'll be chewing it on bank holidays
i don't know about germany but he pushed back his chair and got up
well i'm solid on that
and what i say goes
now i'll tell you what i'll do kid
i'll take you down to st louis with me at a figure that'll make your  jock looked up
or if you don't want the berg shriner crowd to get wise i'll fix it this way
i'll go over there this morning and tell 'em i've changed my mind see
the campaign's theirs see
then i refuse to consider any of their suggestions until i see your plan
and when i see it i fall for it like a ton of bricks
old berg'll never know
he's so darned highprincipled  jock mcchesney stood up
the little drawn pinched look which had made his face so queerly old was gone
his eyes were bright
his face was flushed
there
you've said it
i didn't realize how raw this deal was until you put it into words for me
i want to thank you
you're right
bartholomew berg is so darned highprincipled that two muckers like you and me groveling around in the dirt can't even see the tips of the heights to which his ideals have soared
don't stop me
i know i'm talking like a book
but i feel like something that has just been kicked out into the sunshine after having been in jail
you're tired said ben griebler
it's been a strain
something always snaps after a long tension
jock's flat palm came down among the papers with a crack
you bet something snaps
it has just snapped inside me
he began quietly to gather up the papers in an orderly little way
what's that for
inquired griebler coming forward
you don't mean  i mean that i'm going to go home and square this thing with a lady you've never met
you and she wouldn't get on if you did
you don't talk the same language
then i'm going to have a cold bath and a hot breakfast
and then griebler i'm going to take this stuff to bartholomew berg and tell him the whole nasty business
he'll see the humor of it
but i don't know whether he'll fire me or make me vicepresident of the company
now if you want to come over and talk to him fair and square why come
ten to one he fires you remarked griebler as jock reached the door
there's only one person i know who's game enough to take you up on that
and it's going to take more nerve to face her at sixthirty than it will to tackle a whole battalion of bartholomew bergs at nine
well i guess i can get in a threehour sleep beforeer  before what
said jock mcchesney from the door
ben griebler laughed a little shamefaced laugh
before i see you at ten sonny
v  the selfstarter   there is nothing in the sound of the shrill little bell to warn us of the import of its message
more's the pity
it may be that bore whose telephone conversation begins well what do you know today
it may be your lawyer to say you've inherited a million
hence the arrogance of the instrument
it knows its voice will never wilfully go unanswered so long as the element of chance lies concealed within it
mrs emma mcchesney heard the call of her telephone across the hall
seated in the office of her business partner ta
buck she was fathoms deep in discussion of the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company's new spring line
the buzzer's insistent voice brought her to her feet even while she frowned at the interruption
that'll be baumgartner 'phoning about those silk swatches
back in a minute said emma mcchesney and hurried across the hall just in time to break the second call
the perfunctory hello
yes was followed by a swift change of countenance a surprised little cry thenin quite another toneoh it's you jock
i wasn't expecting  no not too busy to talk to you you young chump
go on
a moment of silence while mrs mcchesney's face smiled and glowed like a girl's as she listened to the voice of her son
then suddenly glow and smile faded
she grew tense
her head that had been leaning so carelessly on the hand that held the receiver came up with a jerk
jock mcchesney
she gasped youwhy you don't mean  now emma mcchesney was not a woman given to jerky conversations interspersed with exclamation points
her poise and balance had become a proverb in the business world
yet her lips were trembling now
her eyes were very round and bright
her face had flushed then grown white
her voice shook a little
yes of course i am
only i'm so surprised
yes i'll be home early
fivethirty at the latest
she hung up the receiver with a little fumbling gesture
her hand dropped to her lap then came up to her throat a moment dropped again
she sat staring straight ahead with eyes that saw one thousand miles away
from his office across the hall ta
buck strolled in casually
did baumgartner say he'd
he stopped as mrs mcchesney looked up at him
a quick step forwardwhat's the matter emma
jockjock  jock
what's happened to the boy
then as she still stared at him her face pitiful his hand patted her shoulder
dear girl tell me
he bent over her all solicitude
don't
said emma mcchesney faintly and shook off his hand
your stenographer can seewhat will the office think
please  oh darn the stenographer
what's this bad news of jock
emma mcchesney sat up
she smiled a little nervously and passed her handkerchief across her lips
i didn't say it was bad did i
that is not exactly bad i suppose
ta
buck ran a frenzied hand over his head
my dear child with careful politeness will you please try to be sane
i find you sitting at your desk staring into space your face white as a ghost's your whole appearance that of a person who has received a deathblow
and then you say 'not exactly bad'
it's this explained emma mcchesney in a hollow tone the berg shriner advertising company has appointed jock manager of their new western branch
they're opening offices in chicago in march
her lower lip quivered
she caught it sharply between her teeth
for one surprised moment ta
buck stared in silence
then a roar broke from him
not exactly bad
he boomed between laughs
not exactly bnot exactly eh
then he was off again
mrs mcchesney surveyed him in hurt and dignified silence
thenwell really ta don't mind me
what you find so exquisitely funny  that's the funniest part of it
that you of all people shouldn't see the joke
not exactly bad
he wiped his eyes
why do you mean to tell me that because your young cub of a son by a heavensent stroke of good fortune has landed a job that men twice his age would give their eyeteeth to get i find you sitting at the telephone looking as if he had run off with annie the cook or had had a leg cut off
i suppose it is funny
only the joke's on me
that's why i can't see it
it means that i'm losing him
that's the first selfish word i've ever heard you utter
oh don't think i'm not happy at his success
happy
haven't i hoped for it and worked for it and prayed for it
haven't i saved for it and skimped for it
how do you think i could have stood those years on the road if i hadn't kept up courage with the thought that it was all for him
don't i know how narrowly jock escaped being the wrong kind
i'm his mother but i'm not quite blind
i know he had the making of a firstclass cad
i've seen him start off in the wrong direction a hundred times
if he has turned out a success it's because you've steered him right
i've watched you make him over
and now when his big chance has come you  i don't expect you to understand interrupted emma mcchesney a little wearily
i know it sounds crazy and unreasonable
there's only one sort of human being who could understand what i mean
that's a woman with a son
she laughed a little shamefacedly
i'm talking like the chorus of a minorwail sob song but it's the truth
if you feel like that emma tell him to stay
the boy wouldn't go if he thought it would make you unhappy
not go
cried emma mcchesney sharply
i'd like to see him dare to refuse it
well then what in began buck bewildered
don't try to understand it ta
it's no use
don't try to poke your finger into the whirligig they call 'woman's sphere'
its mechanism is too complicated
it's the same quirk that makes women pray for daughters and men for sons
it's the same kink that makes women read the marriage and death notices first in a newspaper
it's the same queer strain that causes a mother to lavish the most love on the weakest wilfullest child
perhaps i wouldn't have loved jock so much if there hadn't been that streak of yellow in him and if i hadn't had to work so hard to dilute it until now it's only a faint cream color
there ought to be a special prayer for women who are bringing up their sons alone
buck stirred a little uneasily
i've never heard you talk like this before
you probably never will again
she swung round to her desk
ta
buck strolling toward the door still wore the puzzled look
i don't know what makes you take this so seriously
of course the boy will be a long way off
but then you've been separated from him before
what's the difference now
ta said emma mcchesney solemnly jock will be drawing a mansize salary now
something tells me i'll be a grandmother in another two years
girls aren't letting men like jock run around loose
he'll be gobbled up
just you wait
oh i don't know drawled buck mischievously
you've just said he's a headstrong young cub
he strikes me as the kind who'd raise the dickens if his threeminute egg happened to be five seconds overtime
emma mcchesney swung around in her chair
look here ta
as business partners we've quarreled about everything from silk samples to traveling men and as friends we've wrangled on every subject from weather to war
i've allowed you to criticise my soul theories and my new spring hat
but understand that i'm the only living person who has the right to villify my son jock mcchesney
the telephone buzzed a punctuation to this period
baumgartner
inquired buck humbly
she listened a moment then over her shoulder baumgartnergrimly her hand covering the mouthpieceand if he thinks that he can work off a lot of last year's silk swatches onhello
yes mrs mcchesney talking
look here mr baumgartner  and for the time being emma mcchesney mother was relegated to the background while emma mcchesney secretary of the ta
buck featherloom petticoat company held the stage
having said that she would be home at fivethirty
mrs mcchesney was home at fivethirty being that kind of a person
jock came in at six breathless brighteyed eager and late being that kind of a person
he found his mother on the floor before the chiffonier in his bedroom surrounded by piles of pajamas socks shirts and collars
illustration he found his mother on the floor  surrounded   by piles of pajamas socks shirts and collars  he swooped down upon her from the doorway
what do you think of your blueeyed boy
poor eh
emma mcchesney looked up absently
jock these mediumweights of yours didn't wear at all and you paid five dollars for them
mediumweights
what in  you've enough silk socks to last you the rest of your natural life
handkerchiefs too
but you'll need pajamas
jock stooped gathered up an armful of miscellaneous undergarments and tossed them into an open drawer
then he shut the drawer with a bang reached over grasped his mother firmly under the arms and brought her to her feet with a swing
we will now consider the question of summer underwear ended
would it bore you too much to touch lightly on the subject of your son's future
emma mcchesney tall straight handsome looked up at her son taller straighter handsomer
then she took him by the coat lapels and hugged him
you were so bursting with your own glory that i couldn't resist teasing you
besides i had to do something to keep my mind offoff  why blonde dear you're not
no i'm not gulped emma mcchesney
don't flatter yourself young 'un
tell me just how it happened
from the beginning
she perched at the side of the bed
jock hands in pockets hair a little rumpled paced excitedly up and down before her as he talked
there wasn't any beginning
that's the stunning part of it
i just landed right into the middle of it with both feet
i knew they had been planning to start a big western branch
but we all thought they'd pick some big man for it
there are plenty of mediumclass dubs to be had
the kind that answers the ad 'manager wanted young man preferably married able to furnish a reference'
they're as thick as advertising men in detroit on monday morning
but we knew that this western branch was going to be given an equal chance with the new york office
those big western advertisers like to give their money to western firms if they can
so we figured that they'd pick a real topnotchereven hopper or hupp maybeand start out with a bang
so when the old man called me into his office this morning i was as unconscious as a babe
well you know berg
he's as unexpected as a summer shower and twice as full of electricity
'morning mcchesney'
he said
'that a new york necktie you're wearing'
'strictly' says i
'ever try any chicago ties'
'not from choice
that time my suit case went astray'  'mmmm yes'
he drummed his fingers on the table top a couple of times
thenmcchesney what have you learned about advertising in the last two and a half years'
i was wise enough as to bartholomew berg to know that he didn't mean any cutanddried knowledge
he didn't mean rules of the game
he meant tricks
'well' i said 'i've learned to watch a man's eyes when i'm talking business to him
if the pupils of his eyes dilate he's listening to you and thinking about what you're saying
when they contract it means that he's only faking interest even though he's looking straight at you and wearing a rapt expression
his thoughts are miles away'
'that so'
said berg and sort of grinned
'what else'
'i've learned that one negative argument is worth six positive ones that it never pays to knock your competitor that it's wise to fight shy of that joker known as editorial coperation'
'that so'
said berg
'anything else'
i made up my mind i could play the game as long as he could
'i've learned not to lose my temper when i'm in the middle of a whitehot impassioned business appeal and the office boy bounces in to say to the boss mrs jones is waiting
she says you were going to help her pick out wall paper this morning and jones says tell her i'll be there in five minutes'
'sure you've learned that'
said berg
'sure' says i
'and i've learned to let the other fellow think your argument's his own
he likes it
i've learned that the surest kind of copy is the slow insidious kind like the featherloom petticoat company's campaign
that was an ideal campaign because it didn't urge and insist that the public buy featherlooms
it just eased the idea to them
it started by sketching a history of the petticoat beginning with eve's fig leaf and working up
before they knew it they were interested'
'that so
that campaign was your mother's idea mcchesney'
you know mother he thinks you're a wonder
so i am agreed emma mcchesney calmly
go on
well i went on
i told him that i'd learned to stand so that the light wouldn't shine in my client's eyes when i was talking to him
i lost a big order once because the glare from the window irritated the man i was talking to
i told berg all the tricks i'd learned and some i hadn't thought of till that minute
berg put in a word now and then
i thought he was sort of guying me as he sometimes doesnot unkindly you know but in that quiet way he has
finally i stopped for breath or something and he said  'now let me talk a minute mcchesney
anybody can teach you the essentials of the advertising business if you've any advertising instinct in you
but it's what you pick up on the side by your own efforts and out of your own experience that lifts you out of the scrub class
now i don't think you're an ideal advertising man by any means mcchesney
you're shy on training and experience and you've just begun to acquire that golden quality known as balance
i could name a hundred men that are better allaround advertising men than you will ever be
those men have advertising ability that glows steadily and evenly like a wellbanked fire
but you've got the kind of ability that flares up dies down flares up
but every flare is a real blaze that lights things red while it lasts and sends a new glow through the veins of business
you've got personality and youth and enthusiasm and a precious spark of the real thing known as advertising genius
there's no describing it
you know what i mean
also you know enough about actual advertising not to run an ad for a fivethousanddollar motor car in the police gazette
all of which leads up to this question how would you like to buy your neckties in chicago mcchesney'
'chicago'
i blurted
'we've taken a suite of offices in the new lakeview building on michigan avenue
would you like your office done in mahogany or oak'
jock came to a full stop before his mother
his cheeks were scarlet
hers were pale
he was breathing quickly
she was very quiet
his eyes glowed
so did hers but the glow was dimmed by a mist
mahogany's richer but make it oak son
it doesn't show fingermarks so
then quite suddenly she stood up shaking a little and buried her face in the boy's shoulder
whywhy mother
don't
don't blonde
we'll see each other every few weeks
i'll be coming to new york to see the sights like the rest of the rubes and i suppose the noise and lights will confuse me so that i'll be glad to get back to the sylvan quiet of chicago
and then you'll run out there eh
we'll have regular bats mrs mack
dinner and the theater and supper
yes
yes said emma mcchesney in muffled tones that totally lacked enthusiasm
chicago's really only a suburb of new york anyway these days and  emma mcchesney's head came up sharply
look here son
if you're going to live in chicago i advise you to cut that suburb talk and sort of forget new york
chicago's quite a village for an inland settlement even if it has only two or three million people and a lake as big as all outdoors
that kind of talk won't elect you to the university club son
so they talked all through supper and during the evening
rather jock talked and his mother listened interrupting with only an occasional remark when the bubble of the boy's elation seemed to grow too great
quite suddenly jock was silent
after the almost incessant rush of conversation quiet settled down strangely on the two seated there in the livingroom with its softshaded lamps
jock picked up a magazine twirled its pages put it down strolled into his own room and back again
mother he said suddenly standing before her there was a time when you were afraid i wasn't going to pan out wasn't there
not exactly afraid dear just a little doubtful perhaps
jock smiled a tolerant forgiving smile
you see mother you didn't understand that's all
a woman doesn't
i was all right
a man would have realized that
i don't mean dear that you haven't always been wonderful because you have
but it takes a man to understand a man
when you thought i was going bad on your hands i was just developing that's all
remember that time in chicago mother
yes answered emma mcchesney i remember
now a man would have understood that that was only kid foolishness
if a fellow's got the stuff in him it'll show up sooner or later
if i hadn't had it in me i wouldn't be going to chicago as manager of the berg shriner western office would i
no dear
jock looked at her
in an instant he was all contrition and tenderness
you're tired
i've talked you to death haven't i
lordy it's midnight
and i want to get down early tomorrow
conference with mr berg and hupp
he tried not to sound too important
emma mcchesney took his head between her two hands and kissed him once on the lips then standing atiptoe kissed his eyelids with infinite gentleness as you kiss a baby's eyes
then she brought his cheek up against hers
and so they stood for a moment silently
ten minutes later there came the sound of blithe whistling from jock's room
jock always whistled when he went to bed and when he rose
even these years of living in a new york apartment had not broken him of the habit
it was a cheerful disconnected whistling sometimes high and clear sometimes under the breath sometimes interspersed with song and sometimes ceasing altogether at critical moments say during shaving or while bringing the fourinhand up tight and snug under the collar
it was one of those comfortable little noises that indicate a masculine presence one of those pleasant reassuring maninthehouse noises that every woman loves
emma mcchesney putting herself to bed in her room across the hall found herself listening brush poised lips parted as though to the exquisite strains of celestial music
there came the thump of a shoe on the floor
an interval of quiet
then another thump
without having been conscious of it emma mcchesney had grown to love the noises that accompanied jock's retiring and rising
his dressing was always signalized by bangings and thumpings
his splashings in the tub were tremendous
his morning plunge could be heard all over the sixroom apartment
mrs mcchesney used to call gayly through the door  mercy jock
you sound like a school of whales coming up for air
you'll think i'm a school of sharks when it comes to breakfast jock would call back
tell annie to make enough toast mum
she's the tightest thing with the toast i ever did  the rest would be lost in a final surging splash
the noises in the room across the hall had subsided now
she listened more intently
no a drawer banged
another
then  hasn't my gray suit come back from the tailor's
it was to be sponged too you know
he said he'd bring it wednesday
this is tuesday
oh
another bang
then 'night mother
good night dear
creaking sounds then a long comfortable sigh of complete relaxation
emma mcchesney went on with her brushing
she brushed her hair with the usual number of swift even strokes from the top of the shining head to the waist
she braided her hair into two plaits gretchen fashion
millions of scantylocked women would have given all they possessed to look as emma mcchesney looked standing there in kimono and gown
she nicked out the light
then she too relaxed upon her pillow with a little sigh
quiet fell on the little apartment
the street noises came up to her now roaring now growing faint
emma mcchesney lay there sleepless
she lay flat hands clasped across her breast her braids spread out on the pillow
in the darkness of the room the years rolled before her in panorama her girlhood her marriage her unhappiness jock the divorce the struggle for work those ten years on the road
those ten years on the road
how she had hated themand loved them
the stuffy trains the jarring sleepers the bare little hotel bedrooms the bad food the irregular hours the loneliness the hard work the disappointments the temptations
yes but the fascination of it the dear friends she had made the great human lesson of it all
and all for jock
that jock might have good schools good clothes good books good surroundings happy times
why jock had been the reason for it all
she had swallowed insult because of jock
she had borne the drudgery because of jock
she had resisted temptation smiled under hardship worked fought saved succeeded all because of jock
and now this pivot about which her whole life had revolved was to be pulled up wrenched away
over emma mcchesney lying there in the dark there swept one of those unreasoning nightfears
the fear of living
the fear of life
a straining of the eyeballs in the dark
the pounding of heartbeats
she sat up in bed
her hands went to her face
her cheeks were burning and her eyes smarted
she felt that she must see jock
at once
just to be near him
to touch him
to take him in her arms with his head in the hollow of her breast as she used to when he was a baby
why he had been a baby only yesterday
and now he was a man
big enough to stand alone to live alone to do without her
emma mcchesney flung aside the covers and sprang out of bed
she thrust her feet in slippers groped for the kimono at the foot of the bed and tiptoed to the door
she listened
no sound from the other room
she stole across the hall stopped listened gained the door
it was open an inch or more
just to be near him to know that he lay there sleeping
she pushed the door very very gently
then she stood in the doorway a moment scarcely breathing her head thrust forward her whole body tense with listening
she could not hear him breathe
she caught her breath again in that unreasoning fear and took a quick step forward
stop or i'll shoot
said a voice
simultaneously the light flashed on
emma mcchesney found herself blinking at a determined young man who was steadily pointing a short chubby businesslike looking steel affair in her direction
then the hand that held the steel dropped
what is this anyway
demanded jock rather crossly
a george cohan comedy
emma mcchesney leaned against the foot of the bed rather weakly
what did you think  what would you think if you heard some one come sneaking along the hall stopping listening sneaking to your door and then opening it and listening again and sneaking in
what would you think it was
how did i know you were going around making social calls at two o'clock in the morning
suddenly emma mcchesney began to laugh
she leaned over the footboard and laughed hysterically her head in her arms
jock stared a moment in offended disapproval
then the humor of it caught him and he buried his head in his pillow to stifle unseemly shrieks
his legs kicked spasmodically beneath the bedclothes
as suddenly as she had begun to laugh mrs mcchesney became very sober
stop it jock
tell me why weren't you sleeping
i don't know replied jock as suddenly solemn
isort ofbegan to think and i couldn't sleep
what were you thinking of
jock looked down at the bedclothes and traced a pattern with one forefinger on the sheet
then he looked up
thinking of you
oh
said emma mcchesney like a bashful schoolgirl
ofme
jock sat up very straight and clasped his hands about his knees
i got to thinking of what i had said about having made good all alone
that's rot
it isn't so
i was striped with yellow like a stick of lemon candy
if i've got this far it's all because of you
i've been thinking all along that i was the original electric selfstarter when you've really had to get out and crank me every few miles
into emma mcchesney's face there came a wonderful look
it was the sort of look with which a newlymade angel might receive her crown and harp
it was the look with which a warhero sees the medal pinned on his breast
it was the look of one who has come into her reward
therefore  what nonsense
said emma mcchesney
if you hadn't had it in you it wouldn't have come out
it wasn't in me in the first place contested jock stubbornly
you planted it
from her stand at the foot of the bed she looked at him her eyes glowing brighter and brighter with that wonderful look
now see hereseverelyi want you to go to sleep
i don't intend to stand here and dispute about your ethical innards at this hour
i'm going to kiss you again
oh well if you must grinned jock resignedly and folded her in a bearhug
to emma mcchesney it seemed that the next three weeks leaped by not by days but in one great bound
and the day came when a little chattering animated group clustered about the slim young chap who was fumbling with his tickets glancing at his watch signaling a porter for his bags talking laughing trying to hide the pangs of departure under a cloak of gayety and badinage that deceived no one
least of all did it deceive the two women who stood there
the eyes of the older woman never left his face
the eyes of the younger one seldom were raised to his but she saw his every expression
once emma mcchesney's eyes shifted a little so as to include both the girl and the boy in her gaze
grace galt in her blue serge and smart blue hat was worth a separate glance
sam hupp was there ta
buck hopper who was to be with him in chicago for the first few weeks three or four of the younger men in the office frankly envious and heartily congratulatory
they followed him to his train all laughter and animation
if this train doesn't go in two minutes said jock i'll get scared and chuck the whole business
funny but i'm not so keen on going as i was three weeks ago
his eyes rested on the girl in the blue serge and the smart hat
emma mcchesney saw that
she saw that his eyes still rested there as he stood on the observation platform when the train pulled out
the sight did not pain her as she thought it would
there was success in every line of him as he stood there hat in hand
there was assurance in every breath of him
his clothes his skin his clear eyes his slim body all were as they should be
he had made a place in the world
he was to be a builder of ideas
she thought of him and of the girl in blue serge and of their childrentobe
her breast swelled exultingly
her head came up
this was her handiwork
she looked at it and found that it was good
let's strike for the afternoon and call it a holiday suggested buck
emma mcchesney turned
the train was gone
ta you'll never grow up
never want to
come on let's play hooky emma
can't
i've a dozen letters to get out and miss loeb wants to show me that new knickerbocker design of hers
they drove back to the office almost in silence
emma mcchesney made straight for her desk and began dictating letters with an energy that bordered on fury
at five o'clock she was still working
at fivethirty ta
buck came in to find her still surrounded by papers samples models
what is this
he demanded wrathfully an allnight session
emma mcchesney looked up from her desk
her face was flushed her eyes bright but there was about her an indefinable air of weariness
ta i'm afraid to go home
i'll rattle around in that empty flat like a hickory nut in a barrel
we'll have dinner downtown and go to the theater
no use
i'll have to go home sometime
now emma remonstrated buck you'll soon get used to it
think of all the years you got along without him
you were happy weren't you
happy because i had somebody to work for somebody to plan for somebody to worry about
when i think of what that flat will be without himwhy just to wake up and know that you can say good morning to some one who cares
that's worth living for isn't it
emma said ta
evenly do you realize that you are virtually hounding me into asking you to marry me
ta
gasped emma mcchesney
well you said you wanted somebody to worry about didn't you
illustration 'well you said you wanted somebody to worry   about didn't you'
a little whimsical smile lay lightly on his lips
timothy buck i'm over forty years old
emma in another minute i'm going to grow sentimental and nothing can stop me
she looked down at her hands
there fell a little silence
buck stirred leaned forward
she looked up from the little watch that ticked away at her wrist
the minute's up ta said emma mcchesney
the end
