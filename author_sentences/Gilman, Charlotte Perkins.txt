herland by charlotte perkins stetson gilman a not unnatural enterprise this is written from memory unfortunately
if i could have brought with me the material i so carefully prepared this would be a very different story
whole books full of notes carefully copied records firsthand descriptions and the picturesthats the worst loss
we had some birdseyes of the cities and parks a lot of lovely views of streets of buildings outside and in and some of those gorgeous gardens and most important of all of the women themselves
nobody will ever believe how they looked
descriptions arent any good when it comes to women and i never was good at descriptions anyhow
but its got to be done somehow the rest of the world needs to know about that country
i havent said where it was for fear some selfappointed missionaries or traders or landgreedy expansionists will take it upon themselves to push in
they will not be wanted i can tell them that and will fare worse than we did if they do find it
it began this way
there were three of us classmates and friendsterry o nicholson we used to call him the old nick with good reason jeff margrave and i vandyck jennings
we had known each other years and years and in spite of our differences we had a good deal in common
all of us were interested in science
terry was rich enough to do as he pleased
his great aim was exploration
he used to make all kinds of a row because there was nothing left to explore now only patchwork and filling in he said
he filled in well enoughhe had a lot of talentsgreat on mechanics and electricity
had all kinds of boats and motorcars and was one of the best of our airmen
we never could have done the thing at all without terry
jeff margrave was born to be a poet a botanistor bothbut his folks persuaded him to be a doctor instead
he was a good one for his age but his real interest was in what he loved to call the wonders of science as for me sociologys my major
you have to back that up with a lot of other sciences of course
im interested in them all
terry was strong on factsgeography and meteorology and those jeff could beat him any time on biology and i didnt care what it was they talked about so long as it connected with human life somehow
there are few things that dont
we three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition
they needed a doctor and that gave jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening practice they needed terrys experience his machine and his money and as for me i got in through terrys influence
the expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous hinterland of a great river up where the maps had to be made savage dialects studied and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected
but this story is not about that expedition
that was only the merest starter for ours
my interest was first roused by talk among our guides
im quick at languages know a good many and pick them up readily
what with that and a really good interpreter we took with us i made out quite a few legends and folk myths of these scattered tribes
and as we got farther and farther upstream in a dark tangle of rivers lakes morasses and dense forests with here and there an unexpected long spur running out from the big mountains beyond i noticed that more and more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible woman land in the high distance
up yonder over there way upwas all the direction they could offer but their legends all agreed on the main pointthat there was this strange country where no men livedonly women and girl children
none of them had ever seen it
it was dangerous deadly they said for any man to go there
but there were tales of long ago when some brave investigator had seen ita big country big houses plenty peopleall women
had no one else gone
yesa good manybut they never came back
it was no place for menof that they seemed sure
i told the boys about these stories and they laughed at them
naturally i did myself
i knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of
but when we had reached our farthest point just the day before we all had to turn around and start for home again as the best of expeditions must in time we three made a discovery
the main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main stream or what we thought was the main stream
it had the same muddy color we had been seeing for weeks past the same taste
i happened to speak of that river to our last guide a rather superior fellow with quick bright eyes
he told me that there was another riverover there short river sweet water red and blue i was interested in this and anxious to see if i had understood so i showed him a red and blue pencil i carried and asked again
yes he pointed to the river and then to the southwestward
rivergood waterred and blue terry was close by and interested in the fellows pointing
what does he say van i told him
terry blazed up at once
ask him how far it is the man indicated a short journey i judged about two hours maybe three
lets go urged terry
just us three
maybe we can really find something
may be cinnabar in it may be indigo jeff suggested with his lazy smile
it was early yet we had just breakfasted and leaving word that wed be back before night we got away quietly not wishing to be thought too gullible if we failed and secretly hoping to have some nice little discovery all to ourselves
it was a long two hours nearer three
i fancy the savage could have done it alone much quicker
there was a desperate tangle of wood and water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across alone
but there was one and i could see terry with compass and notebook marking directions and trying to place landmarks
we came after a while to a sort of marshy lake very big so that the circling forest looked quite low and dim across it
our guide told us that boats could go from there to our campbut long wayall day this water was somewhat clearer than that we had left but we could not judge well from the margin
we skirted it for another half hour or so the ground growing firmer as we advanced and presently we turned the corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different countrya sudden view of mountains steep and bare
one of those long easterly spurs terry said appraisingly
may be hundreds of miles from the range
they crop out like that suddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs
we heard running water before we reached it and the guide pointed proudly to his river
it was short
we could see where it poured down a narrow vertical cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff
it was sweet water
the guide drank eagerly and so did we
thats snow water terry announced
must come from way back in the hills but as to being red and blueit was greenish in tint
the guide seemed not at all surprised
he hunted about a little and showed us a quiet marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border yes and of blue
terry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate
chemicals of some sorti cant tell on the spot
look to me like dyestuffs
lets get nearer he urged up there by the fall we scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed and boiled beneath the falling water
here we searched the border and found traces of color beyond dispute
morejeff suddenly held up an unlookedfor trophy
it was only a rag a long raveled fragment of cloth
but it was a wellwoven fabric with a pattern and of a clear scarlet that the water had not faded
no savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics
the guide stood serenely on the bank well pleased with our excitement
one day blueone day redone day green he told us and pulled from his pouch another strip of brighthued cloth
come down he said pointing to the cataract
woman countryup there then we were interested
we had our rest and lunch right there and pumped the man for further information
he could tell us only what the others hada land of womenno menbabies but all girls
no place for mendangerous
some had gone to seenone had come back
i could see terrys jaw set at that
no place for men
dangerous
he looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot
but the guide would not hear of going up even if there had been any possible method of scaling that sheer cliff and we had to get back to our party before night
they might stay if we told them i suggested
but terry stopped in his tracks
look here fellows he said
this is our find
lets not tell those cocky old professors
lets go on home with em and then come backjust ushave a little expedition of our own we looked at him much impressed
there was something attractive to a bunch of unattached young men in finding an undiscovered country of a strictly amazonian nature
of course we didnt believe the storybut yet
there is no such cloth made by any of these local tribes i announced examining those rags with great care
somewhere up yonder they spin and weave and dyeas well as we do that would mean a considerable civilization van
there couldnt be such a placeand not known about oh well i dont know
whats that old republic up in the pyrenees somewhereandorra
precious few people know anything about that and its been minding its own business for a thousand years
then theres montenegrosplendid little stateyou could lose a dozen montenegroes up and down these great ranges we discussed it hotly all the way back to camp
we discussed it with care and privacy on the voyage home
we discussed it after that still only among ourselves while terry was making his arrangements
he was hot about it
lucky he had so much moneywe might have had to beg and advertise for years to start the thing and then it would have been a matter of public amusementjust sport for the papers
but t o nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht load his speciallymade big motorboat aboard and tuck in a dissembled biplane without any more notice than a snip in the society column
we had provisions and preventives and all manner of supplies
his previous experience stood him in good stead there
it was a very complete little outfit
we were to leave the yacht at the nearest safe port and go up that endless river in our motorboat just the three of us and a pilot then drop the pilot when we got to that last stopping place of the previous party and hunt up that clear water stream ourselves
the motorboat we were going to leave at anchor in that wide shallow lake
it had a special covering of fitted armor thin but strong shut up like a clamshell
those natives cant get into it or hurt it or move it terry explained proudly
well start our flier from the lake and leave the boat as a base to come back to if we come back i suggested cheerfully
fraid the ladies will eat you he scoffed
were not so sure about those ladies you know drawled jeff
there may be a contingent of gentlemen with poisoned arrows or something you dont need to go if you dont want to terry remarked drily
go
youll have to get an injunction to stop me both jeff and i were sure about that
but we did have differences of opinion all the long way
an ocean voyage is an excellent time for discussion
now we had no eavesdroppers we could loll and loaf in our deck chairs and talk and talkthere was nothing else to do
our absolute lack of facts only made the field of discussion wider
well leave papers with our consul where the yacht stays terry planned
if we dont come back insay a monththey can send a relief party after us a punitive expedition i urged
if the ladies do eat us we must make reprisals they can locate that last stopping place easy enough and ive made a sort of chart of that lake and cliff and waterfall yes but how will they get up asked jeff
same way we do of course
if three valuable american citizens are lost up there they will follow somehowto say nothing of the glittering attractions of that fair landlets call it feminisia he broke off
youre right terry
once the story gets out the river will crawl with expeditions and the airships rise like a swarm of mosquitoes i laughed as i thought of it
weve made a great mistake not to let mr yellow press in on this
save us
what headlines not much said terry grimly
this is our party
were going to find that place alone what are you going to do with it when you do find itif you do jeff asked mildly
jeff was a tender soul
i think he thought that countryif there was onewas just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies and all that sort of thing
and terry in his secret heart had visions of a sort of sublimated summer resortjust girls and girls and girlsand that he was going to bewell terry was popular among women even when there were other men around and its not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of what might happen
i could see it in his eyes as he lay there looking at the long blue rollers slipping by and fingering that impressive mustache of his
but i thoughtthenthat i could form a far clearer idea of what was before us than either of them
youre all off boys i insisted
if there is such a placeand there does seem some foundation for believing ityoull find its built on a sort of matriarchal principle thats all
the men have a separate cult of their own less socially developed than the women and make them an annual visita sort of wedding call
this is a condition known to have existedheres just a survival
theyve got some peculiarly isolated valley or tableland up there and their primeval customs have survived
thats all there is to it how about the boys jeff asked
oh the men take them away as soon as they are five or six you see and how about this danger theory all our guides were so sure of danger enough terry and well have to be mighty careful
women of that stage of culture are quite able to defend themselves and have no welcome for unseasonable visitors we talked and talked
and with all my airs of sociological superiority i was no nearer than any of them
it was funny though in the light of what we did find those extremely clear ideas of ours as to what a country of women would be like
it was no use to tell ourselves and one another that all this was idle speculation
we were idle and we did speculate on the ocean voyage and the river voyage too
admitting the improbability wed begin solemnly and then launch out again
they would fight among themselves terry insisted
women always do
we mustnt look to find any sort of order and organization youre dead wrong jeff told him
it will be like a nunnery under an abbessa peaceful harmonious sisterhood i snorted derision at this idea
nuns indeed
your peaceful sisterhoods were all celibate jeff and under vows of obedience
these are just women and mothers and where theres motherhood you dont find sisterhoodnot much no sirtheyll scrap agreed terry
also we mustnt look for inventions and progress itll be awfully primitive how about that cloth mill jeff suggested
oh cloth
women have always been spinsters
but there they stopyoull see we joked terry about his modest impression that he would be warmly received but he held his ground
youll see he insisted
ill get solid with them alland play one bunch against another
ill get myself elected king in no timewhew
solomon will have to take a back seat where do we come in on that deal i demanded
arent we viziers or anything couldnt risk it he asserted solemnly
you might start a revolutionprobably would
no youll have to be beheaded or bowstrungor whatever the popular method of execution is youd have to do it yourself remember grinned jeff
no husky black slaves and mamelukes
and thered be two of us and only one of youeh van jeffs ideas and terrys were so far apart that sometimes it was all i could do to keep the peace between them
jeff idealized women in the best southern style
he was full of chivalry and sentiment and all that
and he was a good boy he lived up to his ideals
you might say terry did too if you can call his views about women anything so polite as ideals
i always liked terry
he was a mans man very much so generous and brave and clever but i dont think any of us in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters
we werent very stringent heavens no
but terry was the limit later onwhy of course a mans life is his own we held and asked no questions
but barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife or of his mother or of course the fair relatives of his friends terrys idea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely ones not worth considering
it was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had
but i got out of patience with jeff too
he had such rosecolored halos on his womenfolks
i held a middle ground highly scientific of course and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the sex
we were not in the least advanced on the woman question any of us then
so we joked and disputed and speculated and after an interminable journey we got to our old camping place at last
it was not hard to find the river just poking along that side till we came to it and it was navigable as far as the lake
when we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom with that high gray promontory running out toward us and the straight white fall clearly visible it began to be really exciting
there was some talk even then of skirting the rock wall and seeking a possible footway up but the marshy jungle made that method look not only difficult but dangerous
terry dismissed the plan sharply
nonsense fellows
weve decided that
it might take monthswe havent got the provisions
no sirweve got to take our chances
if we get back safeall right
if we dont why were not the first explorers to get lost in the shuffle
there are plenty to come after us so we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically compressed baggage the camera of course the glasses a supply of concentrated food
our pockets were magazines of small necessities and we had our guns of coursethere was no knowing what might happen
up and up and up we sailed way up at first to get the lay of the land and make note of it
out of that dark green sea of crowding forest this highstanding spur rose steeply
it ran back on either side apparently to the faroff whitecrowned peaks in the distance themselves probably inaccessible
lets make the first trip geographical i suggested
spy out the land and drop back here for more gasoline
with your tremendous speed we can reach that range and back all right
then we can leave a sort of map on boardfor that relief expedition theres sense in that terry agreed
ill put off being king of ladyland for one more day so we made a long skirting voyage turned the point of the cape which was close by ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed crossed over the base where it left the higher mountains and so back to our lake by moonlight
thats not a bad little kingdom we agreed when it was roughly drawn and measured
we could tell the size fairly by our speed
and from what we could see of the sidesand that icy ridge at the back endits a pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it jeff said
of course we had looked at the land itselfeagerly but we were too high and going too fast to see much
it appeared to be well forested about the edges but in the interior there were wide plains and everywhere parklike meadows and open places
there were cities too that i insisted
it lookedwell it looked like any other countrya civilized one i mean
we had to sleep after that long sweep through the air but we turned out early enough next day and again we rose softly up the height till we could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our pleasure
semitropical
looks like a firstrate climate
its wonderful what a little height will do for temperature terry was studying the forest growth
little height
is that what you call little i asked
our instruments measured it clearly
we had not realized the long gentle rise from the coast perhaps
mighty lucky piece of land i call it terry pursued
now for the folksive had enough scenery so we sailed low crossing back and forth quartering the country as we went and studying it
we sawi cant remember now how much of this we noted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge but we could not help seeing this much even on that excited daya land in a state of perfect cultivation where even the forests looked as if they were cared for a land that looked like an enormous park only it was even more evidently an enormous garden
i dont see any cattle i suggested but terry was silent
we were approaching a village
i confess that we paid small attention to the clean wellbuilt roads to the attractive architecture to the ordered beauty of the little town
we had our glasses out even terry setting his machine for a spiral glide clapped the binoculars to his eyes
they heard our whirring screw
they ran out of the housesthey gathered in from the fields swiftrunning light figures crowds of them
we stared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers sweep off and rise again and then we held our peace for a long run upward
gosh said terry after a while
only women thereand children jeff urged excitedly
but they lookwhy this is a civilized country i protested
there must be men of course there are men said terry
come on lets find em he refused to listen to jeffs suggestion that we examine the country further before we risked leaving our machine
theres a fine landing place right there where we came over he insisted and it was an excellent onea wide flattopped rock overlooking the lake and quite out of sight from the interior
they wont find this in a hurry he asserted as we scrambled with the utmost difficulty down to safer footing
come on boysthere were some good lookers in that bunch of course it was unwise of us
it was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have studied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and trusted ourselves to mere foot service
but we were three young men
we had been talking about this country for over a year hardly believing that there was such a place and nowwe were in it
it looked safe and civilized enough and among those upturned crowding faces though some were terrified enough there was great beautyon that we all agreed
come on cried terry pushing forward
oh come on
here goes for herland rash advances not more than ten or fifteen miles we judged it from our landing rock to that last village
for all our eagerness we thought it wise to keep to the woods and go carefully
even terrys ardor was held in check by his firm conviction that there were men to be met and we saw to it that each of us had a good stock of cartridges
they may be scarce and they may be hidden away somewheresome kind of a matriarchate as jeff tells us for that matter they may live up in the mountains yonder and keep the women in this part of the countrysort of a national harem
but there are men somewheredidnt you see the babies we had all seen babies children big and little everywhere that we had come near enough to distinguish the people
and though by dress we could not be sure of all the grown persons still there had not been one man that we were certain of
i always liked that arab saying first tie your camel and then trust in the lord jeff murmured so we all had our weapons in hand and stole cautiously through the forest
terry studied it as we progressed
talk of civilization he cried softly in restrained enthusiasm
i never saw a forest so petted even in germany
look theres not a dead boughthe vines are trainedactually
and see herehe stopped and looked about him calling jeffs attention to the kinds of trees
they left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side
foodbearing practically all of them they announced returning
the rest splendid hardwood
call this a forest
its a truck farm good thing to have a botanist on hand i agreed
sure there are no medicinal ones
or any for pure ornament as a matter of fact they were quite right
these towering trees were under as careful cultivation as so many cabbages
in other conditions we should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit gatherers but an airship is a conspicuous object and by no means quietand women are cautious
all we found moving in those woods as we started through them were birds some gorgeous some musical all so tame that it seemed almost to contradict our theory of cultivationat least until we came upon occasional little glades where carved stone seats and tables stood in the shade beside clear fountains with shallow bird baths always added
they dont kill birds and apparently they do kill cats terry declared
must be men here
hark we had heard something something not in the least like a birdsong and very much like a suppressed whisper of laughtera little happy sound instantly smothered
we stood like so many pointers and then used our glasses swiftly carefully
it couldnt have been far off said terry excitedly
how about this big tree there was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just entered with thick widespreading branches that sloped out in lapping fans like a beech or pine
it was trimmed underneath some twenty feet up and stood there like a huge umbrella with circling seats beneath
look he pursued
there are short stumps of branches left to climb on
theres someone up that tree i believe we stole near cautiously
look out for a poisoned arrow in your eye i suggested but terry pressed forward sprang up on the seatback and grasped the trunk
in my heart more likely he answered
gee
look boys we rushed close in and looked up
there among the boughs overhead was somethingmore than one somethingthat clung motionless close to the great trunk at first and then as one and all we started up the tree separated into three swiftmoving figures and fled upward
as we climbed we could catch glimpses of them scattering above us
by the time we had reached about as far as three men together dared push they had left the main trunk and moved outward each one balanced on a long branch that dipped and swayed beneath the weight
we paused uncertain
if we pursued further the boughs would break under the double burden
we might shake them off perhaps but none of us was so inclined
in the soft dappled light of these high regions breathless with our rapid climb we rested awhile eagerly studying our objects of pursuit while they in turn with no more terror than a set of frolicsome children in a game of tag sat as lightly as so many big bright birds on their precarious perches and frankly curiously stared at us
girls whispered jeff under his breath as if they might fly if he spoke aloud
peaches added terry scarcely louder
peacherinosapricotnectarines
whew they were girls of course no boys could ever have shown that sparkling beauty and yet none of us was certain at first
we saw short hair hatless loose and shining a suit of some light firm stuff the closest of tunics and kneebreeches met by trim gaiters
as bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger they swung there before us wholly at ease staring as we stared till first one and then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter
then there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth no savage singsong but clear musical fluent speech
we met their laughter cordially and doffed our hats to them at which they laughed again delightedly
then terry wholly in his element made a polite speech with explanatory gestures and proceeded to introduce us with pointing finger
mr
jeff margrave he said clearly jeff bowed as gracefully as a man could in the fork of a great limb
mr
vandyck jenningsi also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance
then terry laid his hand upon his chesta fine chest he had too and introduced himself he was braced carefully for the occasion and achieved an excellent obeisance
again they laughed delightedly and the one nearest me followed his tactics
celis she said distinctly pointing to the one in blue alimathe one in rose then with a vivid imitation of terrys impressive manner she laid a firm delicate hand on her goldgreen jerkinellador this was pleasant but we got no nearer
we cant sit here and learn the language terry protested
he beckoned to them to come nearer most winninglybut they gaily shook their heads
he suggested by signs that we all go down together but again they shook their heads still merrily
then ellador clearly indicated that we should go down pointing to each and all of us with unmistakable firmness and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a lithe arm that we not only go downward but go away altogetherat which we shook our heads in turn
have to use bait grinned terry
i dont know about you fellows but i came prepared he produced from an inner pocket a little box of purple velvet that opened with a snapand out of it he drew a long sparkling thing a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have been worth a million if real ones
he held it up swung it glittering in the sun offered it first to one then to another holding it out as far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him
he stood braced in the fork held firmly by one handthe other swinging his bright temptation reached far out along the bough but not quite to his full stretch
she was visibly moved i noted hesitated spoke to her companions
they chattered softly together one evidently warning her the other encouraging
then softly and slowly she drew nearer
this was alima a tall longlimbed lass wellknit and evidently both strong and agile
her eyes were splendid wide fearless as free from suspicion as a childs who has never been rebuked
her interest was more that of an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an ornament
the others moved a bit farther out holding firmly watching
terrys smile was irreproachable but i did not like the look in his eyesit was like a creature about to spring
i could already see it happenthe dropped necklace the sudden clutching hand the girls sharp cry as he seized her and drew her in
but it didnt happen
she made a timid reach with her right hand for the gay swinging thinghe held it a little nearerthen swift as light she seized it from him with her left and dropped on the instant to the bough below
he made his snatch quite vainly almost losing his position as his hand clutched only air and then with inconceivable rapidity the three bright creatures were gone
they dropped from the ends of the big boughs to those below fairly pouring themselves off the tree while we climbed downward as swiftly as we could
we heard their vanishing gay laughter we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest and gave chase but we might as well have chased wild antelopes so we stopped at length somewhat breathless
no use gasped terry
they got away with it
my word
the men of this country must be good sprinters inhabitants evidently arboreal i grimly suggested
civilized and still arborealpeculiar people you shouldnt have tried that way jeff protested
they were perfectly friendly now weve scared them but it was no use grumbling and terry refused to admit any mistake
nonsense he said
they expected it
women like to be run after
come on lets get to that town maybe well find them there
lets see it was in this direction and not far from the woods as i remember when we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our field glasses
there it was about four miles off the same town we concluded unless as jeff ventured they all had pink houses
the broad green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet a long easy slant with good roads winding pleasantly here and there and narrower paths besides
look at that cried jeff suddenly
there they go sure enough close to the town across a wide meadow three brighthued figures were running swiftly
how could they have got that far in this time
it cant be the same ones i urged
but through the glasses we could identify our pretty treeclimbers quite plainly at least by costume
terry watched them we all did for that matter till they disappeared among the houses
then he put down his glass and turned to us drawing a long breath
mother of mike boyswhat gorgeous girls
to climb like that
to run like that
and afraid of nothing
this country suits me all right
lets get ahead nothing venture nothing have i suggested but terry preferred faint heart neer won fair lady we set forth in the open walking briskly
if there are any men wed better keep an eye out i suggested but jeff seemed lost in heavenly dreams and terry in highly practical plans
what a perfect road
what a heavenly country
see the flowers will you this was jeff always an enthusiast but we could agree with him fully
the road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff sloped slightly to shed rain with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it were europes best
no men eh sneered terry
on either side a double row of trees shaded the footpaths between the trees bushes or vines all fruitbearing now and then seats and little wayside fountains everywhere flowers
wed better import some of these ladies and set em to parking the united states i suggested
mighty nice place theyve got here we rested a few moments by one of the fountains tested the fruit that looked ripe and went on impressed for all our gay bravado by the sense of quiet potency which lay about us
here was evidently a people highly skilled efficient caring for their country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids
under the soft brilliant blue of that clear sky in the pleasant shade of those endless rows of trees we walked unharmed the placid silence broken only by the birds
presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or village we were aiming for
we stopped and studied it
jeff drew a long breath
i wouldnt have believed a collection of houses could look so lovely he said
theyve got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty thats sure agreed terry
i was astonished myself
you see i come from california and theres no country lovelier but when it comes to towns
i have often groaned at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature even though im no art sharp like jeff
but this place
it was built mostly of a sort of dull rosecolored stone with here and there some clear white houses and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like a broken rosary of pink coral
those big white ones are public buildings evidently terry declared
this is no savage country my friend
but no men
boys it behooves us to go forward most politely the place had an odd look more impressive as we approached
its like an exposition its too pretty to be true plenty of palaces but where are the homes oh there are little ones enoughbut it certainly was different from any towns we had ever seen
theres no dirt said jeff suddenly
theres no smoke he added after a little
theres no noise i offered but terry snubbed methats because they are laying low for us wed better be careful how we go in there nothing could induce him to stay out however so we walked on
everything was beauty order perfect cleanness and the pleasantest sense of home over it all
as we neared the center of the town the houses stood thicker ran together as it were grew into rambling palaces grouped among parks and open squares something as college buildings stand in their quiet greens
and then turning a corner we came into a broad paved space and saw before us a band of women standing close together in even order evidently waiting for us
we stopped a moment and looked back
the street behind was closed by another band marching steadily shoulder to shoulder
we went onthere seemed no other way to goand presently found ourselves quite surrounded by this closemassed multitude women all of them but they were not young
they were not old
they were not in the girl sense beautiful
they were not in the least ferocious
and yet as i looked from face to face calm grave wise wholly unafraid evidently assured and determined i had the funniest feelinga very early feelinga feeling that i traced back and back in memory until i caught up with it at last
it was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong that i had so often felt in early youth when my short legs utmost effort failed to overcome the fact that i was late to school
jeff felt it too i could see he did
we felt like small boys very small boys caught doing mischief in some gracious ladys house
but terry showed no such consciousness
i saw his quick eyes darting here and there estimating numbers measuring distances judging chances of escape
he examined the close ranks about us reaching back far on every side and murmured softly to me every one of em over forty as im a sinner yet they were not old women
each was in the full bloom of rosy health erect serene standing surefooted and light as any pugilist
they had no weapons and we had but we had no wish to shoot
id as soon shoot my aunts muttered terry again
what do they want with us anyhow
they seem to mean business but in spite of that businesslike aspect he determined to try his favorite tactics
terry had come armed with a theory
he stepped forward with his brilliant ingratiating smile and made low obeisance to the women before him
then he produced another tribute a broad soft scarf of filmy texture rich in color and pattern a lovely thing even to my eye and offered it with a deep bow to the tall unsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him
she took it with a gracious nod of acknowledgment and passed it on to those behind her
he tried again this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones a glittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth
he made a brief address including jeff and me as partners in his enterprise and with another bow presented this
again his gift was accepted and as before passed out of sight
if they were only younger he muttered between his teeth
what on earth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old colonels like this in all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously assumed that the women whatever else they might be would be young
most men do think that way i fancy
woman in the abstract is young and we assume charming
as they get older they pass off the stage somehow into private ownership mostly or out of it altogether
but these good ladies were very much on the stage and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother
we looked for nervousnessthere was none
for terror perhapsthere was none
for uneasiness for curiosity for excitementand all we saw was what might have been a vigilance committee of women doctors as cool as cucumbers and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there
six of them stepped forward now one on either side of each of us and indicated that we were to go with them
we thought it best to accede at first anyway and marched along one of these close at each elbow and the others in close masses before behind on both sides
a large building opened before us a very heavy thickwalled impressive place big and oldlooking of gray stone not like the rest of the town
this wont do said terry to us quickly
we mustnt let them get us in this boys
all together now we stopped in our tracks
we began to explain to make signs pointing away toward the big forestindicating that we would go back to itat once
it makes me laugh knowing all i do now to think of us three boysnothing else three audacious impertinent boysbutting into an unknown country without any sort of a guard or defense
we seemed to think that if there were men we could fight them and if there were only womenwhy they would be no obstacles at all
jeff with his gentle romantic oldfashioned notions of women as clinging vines
terry with his clear decided practical theories that there were two kinds of womenthose he wanted and those he didnt desirable and undesirable was his demarcation
the latter as a large class but negligiblehe had never thought about them at all
and now here they were in great numbers evidently indifferent to what he might think evidently determined on some purpose of their own regarding him and apparently well able to enforce their purpose
we all thought hard just then
it had not seemed wise to object to going with them even if we could have our one chance was friendlinessa civilized attitude on both sides
but once inside that building there was no knowing what these determined ladies might do to us
even a peaceful detention was not to our minds and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse
so we made a stand trying to make clear that we preferred the open country
one of them came forward with a sketch of our flier asking by signs if we were the aerial visitors they had seen
this we admitted
they pointed to it again and to the outlying country in different directionsbut we pretended we did not know where it was and in truth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its whereabouts
again they motioned us to advance standing so packed about the door that there remained but the one straight path open
all around us and behind they were massed solidlythere was simply nothing to do but go forwardor fight
we held a consultation
i never fought with women in my life said terry greatly perturbed but im not going in there
im not going to beherded inas if we were in a cattle chute we cant fight them of course jeff urged
theyre all women in spite of their nondescript clothes nice women too good strong sensible faces
i guess well have to go in we may never get out if we do i told them
strong and sensible yes but im not so sure about the good
look at those faces they had stood at ease waiting while we conferred together but never relaxing their close attention
their attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers there was no sense of compulsion about them
terrys term of a vigilance committee was highly descriptive
they had just the aspect of sturdy burghers gathered hastily to meet some common need or peril all moved by precisely the same feelings to the same end
never anywhere before had i seen women of precisely this quality
fishwives and market women might show similar strength but it was coarse and heavy
these were merely athleticlight and powerful
college professors teachers writersmany women showed similar intelligence but often wore a strained nervous look while these were as calm as cows for all their evident intellect
we observed pretty closely just then for all of us felt that it was a crucial moment
the leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on and the surrounding mass moved a step nearer
weve got to decide quick said terry
i vote to go in jeff urged
but we were two to one against him and he loyally stood by us
we made one more effort to be let go urgent but not imploring
in vain
now for a rush boys terry said
and if we cant break em ill shoot in the air then we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying to get to the parliament buildings through a triple cordon of london police
the solidity of those women was something amazing
terry soon found that it was useless tore himself loose for a moment pulled his revolver and fired upward
as they caught at it he fired againwe heard a cry
instantly each of us was seized by five women each holding arm or leg or head we were lifted like children straddling helpless children and borne onward wriggling indeed but most ineffectually
we were borne inside struggling manfully but held secure most womanfully in spite of our best endeavors
so carried and so held we came into a high inner hall gray and bare and were brought before a majestic grayhaired woman who seemed to hold a judicial position
there was some talk not much among them and then suddenly there fell upon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth and nosean order of swimming sweetnessanesthesia
a peculiar imprisonment from a slumber as deep as death as refreshing as that of a healthy child i slowly awakened
it was like rising up up up through a deep warm ocean nearer and nearer to full light and stirring air
or like the return to consciousness after concussion of the brain
i was once thrown from a horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me and i can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life through lifting veils of dream
when i first dimly heard the voices of those about me and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range i assumed that this too would pass and i should presently find myself in my own home
that was precisely the experience of this awakening receding waves of halfcaught swirling vision memories of home the steamer the boat the airship the forestat last all sinking away one after another till my eyes were wide open my brain clear and i realized what had happened
the most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort
i was lying in a perfect bed long broad smooth firmly soft and level with the finest linen some warm light quilt of blanket and a counterpane that was a joy to the eye
the sheet turned down some fifteen inches yet i could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly covered
i felt as light and clean as a white feather
it took me some time to conscientiously locate my arms and legs to feel the vivid sense of life radiate from the wakening center to the extremities
a big room high and wide with many lofty windows whose closed blinds let through soft greenlit air a beautiful room in proportion in color in smooth simplicity a scent of blossoming gardens outside
i lay perfectly still quite happy quite conscious and yet not actively realizing what had happened till i heard terry
gosh was what he said
i turned my head
there were three beds in this chamber and plenty of room for them
terry was sitting up looking about him alert as ever
his remark though not loud roused jeff also
we all sat up
terry swung his legs out of bed stood up stretched himself mightily
he was in a long nightrobe a sort of seamless garment undoubtedly comfortablewe all found ourselves so covered
shoes were beside each bed also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our own
we looked for our clothesthey were not there nor anything of all the varied contents of our pockets
a door stood somewhat ajar it opened into a most attractive bathroom copiously provided with towels soap mirrors and all such convenient comforts with indeed our toothbrushes and combs our notebooks and thank goodness our watchesbut no clothes
then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy closet holding plenty of clothing but not ours
a council of war demanded terry
come on back to bedthe beds all right anyhow
now then my scientific friend let us consider our case dispassionately he meant me but jeff seemed most impressed
they havent hurt us in the least he said
they could have killed usoror anythingand i never felt better in my life that argues that they are all women i suggested and highly civilized
you know you hit one in the last scrimmagei heard her sing outand we kicked awfully terry was grinning at us
so you realize what these ladies have done to us he pleasantly inquired
they have taken away all our possessions all our clothesevery stitch
we have been stripped and washed and put to bed like so many yearling babiesby these highly civilized women jeff actually blushed
he had a poetic imagination
terry had imagination enough of a different kind
so had i also different
i always flattered myself i had the scientific imagination which incidentally i considered the highest sort
one has a right to a certain amount of egotism if founded on factand kept to ones selfi think
no use kicking boys i said
theyve got us and apparently theyre perfectly harmless
it remains for us to cook up some plan of escape like any other bottled heroes
meanwhile weve got to put on these clotheshobsons choice the garments were simple in the extreme and absolutely comfortable physically though of course we all felt like supes in the theater
there was a onepiece cotton undergarment thin and soft that reached over the knees and shoulders something like the onepiece pajamas some fellows wear and a kind of halfhose that came up to just under the knee and stayed therehad elastic tops of their own and covered the edges of the first
then there was a thicker variety of union suit a lot of them in the closet of varying weights and somewhat sturdier materialevidently they would do at a pinch with nothing further
then there were tunics kneelength and some long robes
needless to say we took tunics
we bathed and dressed quite cheerfully
not half bad said terry surveying himself in a long mirror
his hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber and the hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale lacking the plume
the costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women though some of them those working in the fields glimpsed by our glasses when we first flew over wore only the first two
i settled my shoulders and stretched my arms remarking they have worked out a mighty sensible dress ill say that for them with which we all agreed
now then terry proclaimed weve had a fine long sleepweve had a good bathwere clothed and in our right minds though feeling like a lot of neuters
do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to give us any breakfast of course they will jeff asserted confidently
if they had meant to kill us they would have done it before
i believe we are going to be treated as guests hailed as deliverers i think said terry
studied as curiosities i told them
but anyhow we want food
so now for a sortie a sortie was not so easy
the bathroom only opened into our chamber and that had but one outlet a big heavy door which was fastened
we listened
theres someone outside jeff suggested
lets knock so we knocked whereupon the door opened
outside was another large room furnished with a great table at one end long benches or couches against the wall some smaller tables and chairs
all these were solid strong simple in structure and comfortable in usealso incidentally beautiful
this room was occupied by a number of women eighteen to be exact some of whom we distinctly recalled
terry heaved a disappointed sigh
the colonels i heard him whisper to jeff
jeff however advanced and bowed in his best manner so did we all and we were saluted civilly by the tallstanding women
we had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger the smaller tables were already laid with food and we were gravely invited to be seated
the tables were set for two each of us found ourselves placed visavis with one of our hosts and each table had five other stalwarts nearby unobtrusively watching
we had plenty of time to get tired of those women
the breakfast was not profuse but sufficient in amount and excellent in quality
we were all too good travelers to object to novelty and this repast with its new but delicious fruit its dish of large richflavored nuts and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable
there was water to drink and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality some preparation like cocoa
and then and there willynilly before we had satisfied our appetites our education began
by each of our plates lay a little book a real printed book though different from ours both in paper and binding as well of course as in type
we examined them curiously
shades of sauveur muttered terry
were to learn the language we were indeed to learn the language and not only that but to teach our own
there were blank books with parallel columns neatly ruled evidently prepared for the occasion and in these as fast as we learned and wrote down the name of anything we were urged to write our own name for it by its side
the book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook one in which children learned to read and we judged from this and from their frequent consultation as to methods that they had had no previous experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language or of learning any other
on the other hand what they lacked in experience they made up for in genius
such subtle understanding such instant recognition of our difficulties and readiness to meet them were a constant surprise to us
of course we were willing to meet them halfway
it was wholly to our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them and as to refusing to teach themwhy should we
later on we did try open rebellion but only once
that first meal was pleasant enough each of us quietly studying his companion jeff with sincere admiration terry with that highly technical look of his as of a past masterlike a lion tamer a serpent charmer or some such professional
i myself was intensely interested
it was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak on our part
we had no weapons and if we did try to do any damage with a chair say why five to one was too many for us even if they were women that we had found out to our sorrow
it was not pleasant having them always around but we soon got used to it
its better than being physically restrained ourselves jeff philosophically suggested when we were alone
theyve given us a roomwith no great possibility of escapeand personal libertyheavily chaperoned
its better than wed have been likely to get in a mancountry mancountry
do you really believe there are no men here you innocent
dont you know there must be demanded terry
yees jeff agreed
of courseand yet and yetwhat
come you obdurate sentimentalistwhat are you thinking about they may have some peculiar division of labor weve never heard of i suggested
the men may live in separate towns or they may have subdued themsomehowand keep them shut up
but there must be some that last suggestion of yours is a nice one van terry protested
same as theyve got us subdued and shut up
you make me shiver well figure it out for yourself anyway you please
we saw plenty of kids the first day and weve seen those girls real girls terry agreed in immense relief
glad you mentioned em
i declare if i thought there was nothing in the country but those grenadiers id jump out the window speaking of windows i suggested lets examine ours we looked out of all the windows
the blinds opened easily enough and there were no bars but the prospect was not reassuring
this was not the pinkwalled town we had so rashly entered the day before
our chamber was high up in a projecting wing of a sort of castle built out on a steep spur of rock
immediately below us were gardens fruitful and fragrant but their high walls followed the edge of the cliff which dropped sheer down we could not see how far
the distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot
we could look out east west and south
to the southeastward stretched the open country lying bright and fair in the morning light but on either side and evidently behind rose great mountains
this thing is a regular fortressand no women built it i can tell you that said terry
we nodded agreeingly
its right up among the hillsthey must have brought us a long way we saw some kind of swiftmoving vehicles the first day jeff reminded us
if theyve got motors they are civilized civilized or not weve got our work cut out for us to get away from here
i dont propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls till im sure there is no better way we all concurred on this point and returned to our discussion as to the women
jeff continued thoughtful
all the same theres something funny about it he urged
it isnt just that we dont see any menbut we dont see any signs of them
thethereaction of these women is different from any that ive ever met there is something in what you say jeff i agreed
there is a differentatmosphere they dont seem to notice our being men he went on
they treat uswelljust as they do one another
its as if our being men was a minor incident i nodded
id noticed it myself
but terry broke in rudely
fiddlesticks he said
its because of their advanced age
theyre all grandmas i tell youor ought to be
great aunts anyhow
those girls were girls all right werent they yes jeff agreed still slowly
but they werent afraidthey flew up that tree and hid like schoolboys caught out of boundsnot like shy girls and they ran like marathon winnersyoull admit that terry he added
terry was moody as the days passed
he seemed to mind our confinement more than jeff or i did and he harped on alima and how near hed come to catching her
if i had he would say rather savagely wed have had a hostage and could have made terms but jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor and even his guards and so was i
it interested me profoundly to note and study the subtle difference between these women and other women and try to account for them
in the matter of personal appearance there was a great difference
they all wore short hair some few inches at most some curly some not all light and clean and freshlooking
if their hair was only long jeff would complain they would look so much more feminine i rather liked it myself after i got used to it
why we should so admire a womans crown of hair and not admire a chinamans queue is hard to explain except that we are so convinced that the long hair belongs to a woman
whereas the mane in horses is on both and in lions buffalos and such creatures only on the male
but i did miss itat first
our time was quite pleasantly filled
we were free of the garden below our windows quite long in its irregular rambling shape bordering the cliff
the walls were perfectly smooth and high ending in the masonry of the building and as i studied the great stones i became convinced that the whole structure was extremely old
it was built like the preincan architecture in peru of enormous monoliths fitted as closely as mosaics
these folks have a history thats sure i told the others
and some time they were fighterselse why a fortress i said we were free of the garden but not wholly alone in it
there was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about always one of them watching us even if the others were reading playing games or busy at some kind of handiwork
when i see them knit terry said i can almost call them feminine that doesnt prove anything jeff promptly replied
scotch shepherds knitalways knitting when we get out terry stretched himself and looked at the far peaks when we get out of this and get to where the real women arethe mothers and the girls well whatll we do then i asked rather gloomily
how do you know well ever get out this was an unpleasant idea which we unanimously considered returning with earnestness to our studies
if we are good boys and learn our lessons well i suggested
if we are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of usthen perhaps they will let us out
and anywaywhen we do escape it is of immense importance that we know the language personally i was tremendously interested in that language and seeing they had books was eager to get at them to dig into their history if they had one
it was not hard to speak smooth and pleasant to the ear and so easy to read and write that i marveled at it
they had an absolutely phonetic system the whole thing was as scientific as esparanto yet bore all the marks of an old and rich civilization
we were free to study as much as we wished and were not left merely to wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium partly on the roof and partly in the story below
here we learned real respect for our tall guards
no change of costume was needed for this work save to lay off outer clothing
the first one was as perfect a garment for exercise as need be devised absolutely free to move in and i had to admit much betterlooking than our usual one
fortyover fortysome of em fifty i betand look at em grumbled terry in reluctant admiration
there were no spectacular acrobatics such as only the young can perform but for allaround development they had a most excellent system
a good deal of music went with it with posture dancing and sometimes gravely beautiful processional performances
jeff was much impressed by it
we did not know then how small a part of their physical culture methods this really was but found it agreeable to watch and to take part in
oh yes we took part all right
it wasnt absolutely compulsory but we thought it better to please
terry was the strongest of us though i was wiry and had good staying power and jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler but i can tell you those old ladies gave us cards and spades
they ran like deer by which i mean that they ran not as if it was a performance but as if it was their natural gait
we remembered those fleeting girls of our first bright adventure and concluded that it was
they leaped like deer too with a quick folding motion of the legs drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body
i remembered the sprawling spreadeagle way in which some of the fellows used to come over the lineand tried to learn the trick
we did not easily catch up with these experts however
never thought id live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats terry protested
they had games too a good many of them but we found them rather uninteresting at first
it was like two people playing solitaire to see who would get it first more like a race or aa competitive examination than a real game with some fight in it
i philosophized a bit over this and told terry it argued against their having any men about
there isnt a mansize game in the lot i said
but they are interestingi like them jeff objected and im sure they are educational im sick and tired of being educated terry protested
fancy going to a dame schoolat our age
i want to get out but we could not get out and we were being educated swiftly
our special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem
they seemed of rather finer quality than the guards though all were on terms of easy friendliness
mine was named somel jeffs zava and terrys moadine
we tried to generalize from the names those of the guards and of our three girls but got nowhere
they sound well enough and theyre mostly short but theres no similarity of terminationand no two alike
however our acquaintance is limited as yet there were many things we meant to askas soon as we could talk well enough
better teaching i never saw
from morning to night there was somel always on call except between two and four always pleasant with a steady friendly kindness that i grew to enjoy very much
jeff said miss zavahe would put on a title though they apparently had nonewas a darling that she reminded him of his aunt esther at home but terry refused to be won and rather jeered at his own companion when we were alone
im sick of it he protested
sick of the whole thing
here we are cooped up as helpless as a bunch of threeyearold orphans and being taught what they think is necessarywhether we like it or not
confound their oldmaid impudence nevertheless we were taught
they brought in a raised map of their country beautifully made and increased our knowledge of geographical terms but when we inquired for information as to the country outside they smilingly shook their heads
they brought pictures not only the engravings in the books but colored studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds
they brought tools and various small objectswe had plenty of material in our school
if it had not been for terry we would have been much more contented but as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable
dont act like a bear with a sore head i begged him
were getting on finely
every day we can understand them better and pretty soon we can make a reasonable plea to be let out let out he stormed
let outlike children kept after school
i want to get out and im going to
i want to find the men of this place and fightor the girls guess its the girls youre most interested in jeff commented
what are you going to fight withyour fists yesor sticks and stonesid just like to and terry squared off and tapped jeff softly on the jaw
just for instance he said
anyhow he went on we could get back to our machine and clear out if its there i cautiously suggested
oh dont croak van
if it isnt there well find our way down somehowthe boats there i guess it was hard on terry so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider a plan of escape
it was difficult it was highly dangerous but he declared that hed go alone if we wouldnt go with him and of course we couldnt think of that
it appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment
from our end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a fair idea of the stretch of wall and the drop below
also from the roof we could make out more and even in one place glimpse a sort of path below the wall
its a question of three things he said
ropes agility and not being seen thats the hardest part i urged still hoping to dissuade him
one or another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night therefore we must do it at night he answered
thats easy weve got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated afterward said jeff
thats the business risk we must take
im goingif i break my neck there was no changing him
the rope problem was not easy
something strong enough to hold a man and long enough to let us down into the garden and then down over the wall
there were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasiumthey seemed to love to swing and climb on thembut we were never there by ourselves
we should have to piece it out from our bedding rugs and garments and moreover we should have to do it after we were shut in for the night for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our guardians
we had no shears no knives but terry was resourceful
these jennies have glass and china you see
well break a glass from the bathroom and use that
love will find out a way he hummed
when were all out of the window well stand threeman high and cut the rope as far up as we can reach so as to have more for the wall
i know just where i saw that bit of path below and theres a big tree there too or a vine or somethingi saw the leaves it seemed a crazy risk to take but this was in a way terrys expedition and we were all tired of our imprisonment
so we waited for full moon retired early and spent an anxious hour or two in the unskilled manufacture of manstrong ropes
to retire into the depths of the closet muffle a glass in thick cloth and break it without noise was not difficult and broken glass will cut though not as deftly as a pair of scissors
the broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windowswe had not dared leave our lights on too longand we worked hard and fast at our task of destruction
hangings rugs robes towels as well as bedfurnitureeven the mattress coverswe left not one stitch upon another as jeff put it
then at an end window as less liable to observation we fastened one end of our cable strongly to the firmset hinge of the inner blind and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over
this parts easy enoughill come last so as to cut the rope said terry
so i slipped down first and stood well braced against the wall then jeff on my shoulders then terry who shook us a little as he sawed through the cord above his head
then i slowly dropped to the ground jeff following and at last we all three stood safe in the garden with most of our rope with us
goodbye grandma whispered terry under his breath and we crept softly toward the wall taking advantage of the shadow of every bush and tree
he had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot only a scratch of stone on stone but we could see to read in that light
for anchorage there was a tough fairsized shrub close to the wall
now ill climb up on you two again and go over first said terry
thatll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top
then ill go down to the end
if i can get off safely you can see me and followor say ill twitch it three times
if i find theres absolutely no footingwhy ill climb up again thats all
i dont think theyll kill us from the top he reconnoitered carefully waved his hand and whispered ok then slipped over
jeff climbed up and i followed and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying wavering figure dropped hand under hand till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below
then there were three quick pulls and jeff and i not without a joyous sense of recovered freedom successfully followed our leader
our venture we were standing on a narrow irregular all too slanting little ledge and should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off and broken our rash necks but for the vine
this was a thickleaved widespreading thing a little like amphelopsis
its not quite vertical here you see said terry full of pride and enthusiasm
this thing never would hold our direct weight but i think if we sort of slide down on it one at a time sticking in with hands and feet well reach that next ledge alive as we do not wish to get up our rope againand cant comfortably stay herei approve said jeff solemnly
terry slid down firstsaid hed show us how a christian meets his death
luck was with us
we had put on the thickest of those intermediate suits leaving our tunics behind and made this scramble quite successfully though i got a pretty heavy fall just at the end and was only kept on the second ledge by main force
the next stage was down a sort of chimneya long irregular fissure and so with scratches many and painful and bruises not a few we finally reached the stream
it was darker there but we felt it highly necessary to put as much distance as possible behind us so we waded jumped and clambered down that rocky riverbed in the flickering black and white moonlight and leaf shadow till growing daylight forced a halt
we found a friendly nuttree those large satisfying softshelled nuts we already knew so well and filled our pockets
i see that i have not remarked that these women had pockets in surprising number and variety
they were in all their garments and the middle one in particular was shingled with them
so we stocked up with nuts till we bulged like prussian privates in marching order drank all we could hold and retired for the day
it was not a very comfortable place not at all easy to get at just a sort of crevice high up along the steep bank but it was well veiled with foliage and dry
after our exhaustive three or fourhour scramble and the good breakfast food we all lay down along that crackheads and tails as it wereand slept till the afternoon sun almost toasted our faces
terry poked a tentative foot against my head
how are you van
alive yet very much so i told him
and jeff was equally cheerful
we had room to stretch if not to turn around but we could very carefully roll over one at a time behind the sheltering foliage
it was no use to leave there by daylight
we could not see much of the country but enough to know that we were now at the beginning of the cultivated area and no doubt there would be an alarm sent out far and wide
terry chuckled softly to himself lying there on that hot narrow little rim of rock
he dilated on the discomfiture of our guards and tutors making many discourteous remarks
i reminded him that we had still a long way to go before getting to the place where wed left our machine and no probability of finding it there but he only kicked me mildly for a croaker
if you cant boost dont knock he protested
i never said twould be a picnic
but id run away in the antarctic ice fields rather than be a prisoner we soon dozed off again
the long rest and penetrating dry heat were good for us and that night we covered a considerable distance keeping always in the rough forested belt of land which we knew bordered the whole country
sometimes we were near the outer edge and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths beyond
this piece of geography stands up like a basalt column jeff said
nice time well have getting down if they have confiscated our machine for which suggestion he received summary chastisement
what we could see inland was peaceable enough but only moonlit glimpses by daylight we lay very close
as terry said we did not wish to kill the old ladieseven if we could and short of that they were perfectly competent to pick us up bodily and carry us back if discovered
there was nothing for it but to lie low and sneak out unseen if we could do it
there wasnt much talking done
at night we had our marathonobstacle race we stayed not for brake and we stopped not for stone and swam whatever water was too deep to wade and could not be got around but that was only necessary twice
by day sleep sound and sweet
mighty lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did
even that margin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs
but jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful we should have to be as we might run into some stalwart group of gardeners or foresters or nutgatherers at any minute
careful we were feeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not likely to have another opportunity and at last we reached a point from which we could see far below the broad stretch of that still lake from which we had made our ascent
that looks pretty good to me said terry gazing down at it
now if we cant find the plane we know where to aim if we have to drop over this wall some other way the wall at that point was singularly uninviting
it rose so straight that we had to put our heads over to see the base and the country below seemed to be a faroff marshy tangle of rank vegetation
we did not have to risk our necks to that extent however for at last stealing along among the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages we came to that flat space where we had landed and there in unbelievable good fortune we found our machine
covered too by jingo
would you think they had that much sense cried terry
if they had that much theyre likely to have more i warned him softly
bet you the things watched we reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlightmoons are of a painfully unreliable nature but the growing dawn showed us the familiar shape shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas and no slightest sign of any watchman near
we decided to make a quick dash as soon as the light was strong enough for accurate work
i dont care if the old thingll go or not terry declared
we can run her to the edge get aboard and just plane downplopbeside our boat there
look theresee the boat sure enoughthere was our motor lying like a gray cocoon on the flat pale sheet of water
quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings of that cover
confound the thing terry cried in desperate impatience
theyve got it sewed up in a bag
and weve not a knife among us then as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that made terry lift his head like a war horsethe sound of an unmistakable giggle yesthree giggles
there they werecelis alima elladorlooking just as they had when we first saw them standing a little way off from us as interested as mischievous as three schoolboys
hold on terryhold on i warned
thats too easy
look out for a trap let us appeal to their kind hearts jeff urged
i think they will help us
perhaps theyve got knives its no use rushing them anyhow i was absolutely holding on to terry
we know they can outrun and outclimb us he reluctantly admitted this and after a brief parley among ourselves we all advanced slowly toward them holding out our hands in token of friendliness
they stood their ground till we had come fairly near and then indicated that we should stop
to make sure we advanced a step or two and they promptly and swiftly withdrew
so we stopped at the distance specified
then we used their language as far as we were able to explain our plight telling how we were imprisoned how we had escapeda good deal of pantomime here and vivid interest on their parthow we had traveled by night and hidden by day living on nutsand here terry pretended great hunger
i know he could not have been hungry we had found plenty to eat and had not been sparing in helping ourselves
but they seemed somewhat impressed and after a murmured consultation they produced from their pockets certain little packages and with the utmost ease and accuracy tossed them into our hands
jeff was most appreciative of this and terry made extravagant gestures of admiration which seemed to set them off boyfashion to show their skill
while we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us and while ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements celis ran off to some distance and set up a sort of duckonarock arrangement a big yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks alima meanwhile gathering stones
they urged us to throw at it and we did but the thing was a long way off and it was only after a number of failures at which those elvish damsels laughed delightedly that jeff succeeded in bringing the whole structure to the ground
it took me still longer and terry to his intense annoyance came third
then celis set up the little tripod again and looked back at us knocking it down pointing at it and shaking her short curls severely
no she said
badwrong we were quite able to follow her
then she set it up once more put the fat nut on top and returned to the others and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns throwing little stones at that thing while one stayed by as a setterup and they just popped that nut off two times out of three without upsetting the sticks
pleased as punch they were too and we pretended to be but werent
we got very friendly over this game but i told terry wed be sorry if we didnt get off while we could and then we begged for knives
it was easy to show what we wanted to do and they each proudly produced a sort of strong claspknife from their pockets
yes we said eagerly thats it
please we had learned quite a bit of their language you see
and we just begged for those knives but they would not give them to us
if we came a step too near they backed off standing light and eager for flight
its no sort of use i said
come onlets get a sharp stone or somethingwe must get this thing off so we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could and hacked away but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell
terry hacked and dug but said to us under his breath
boys were in pretty good conditionlets make a life and death dash and get hold of those girlsweve got to they had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts and we did take them rather by surprise also as terry said our recent training had strengthened us in wind and limb and for a few desperate moments those girls were scared and we almost triumphant
but just as we stretched out our hands the distance between us widened they had got their pace apparently and then though we ran at our utmost speed and much farther than i thought wise they kept just out of reach all the time
we stopped breathless at last at my repeated admonitions
this is stark foolishness i urged
they are doing it on purposecome back or youll be sorry we went back much slower than we came and in truth we were sorry
as we reached our swaddled machine and sought again to tear loose its covering there rose up from all around the sturdy forms the quiet determined faces we knew so well
oh lord groaned terry
the colonels
its all uptheyre forty to one it was no use to fight
these women evidently relied on numbers not so much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse
they showed no sign of fear and since we had no weapons whatever and there were at least a hundred of them standing ten deep about us we gave in as gracefully as we might
of course we looked for punishmenta closer imprisonment solitary confinement maybebut nothing of the kind happened
they treated us as truants only and as if they quite understood our truancy
back we went not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in electric motors enough like ours to be quite recognizable each of us in a separate vehicle with one ablebodied lady on either side and three facing him
they were all pleasant enough and talked to us as much as was possible with our limited powers
and though terry was keenly mortified and at first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment i for one soon began to feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip
here were my five familiar companions all goodnatured as could be seeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some simple game and even that they politely suppressed
this was a good opportunity to see the country too and the more i saw of it the better i liked it
we went too swiftly for close observation but i could appreciate perfect roads as dustless as a swept floor the shade of endless lines of trees the ribbon of flowers that unrolled beneath them and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and away full of varied charm
we rolled through many villages and towns and i soon saw that the parklike beauty of our firstseen city was no exception
our swift highsweeping view from the plane had been most attractive but lacked detail and in that first day of struggle and capture we noticed little
but now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles an hour and covered quite a good deal of ground
we stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town and here rolling slowly through the streets we saw more of the population
they had come out to look at us everywhere we had passed but here were more and when we went in to eat in a big garden place with little shaded tables among the trees and flowers many eyes were upon us
and everywhere open country village or cityonly women
old women and young women and a great majority who seemed neither young nor old but just women young girls also though these and the children seeming to be in groups by themselves generally were less in evidence
we caught many glimpses of girls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds and so far as we could judge there were no boys
we all looked carefully
everyone gazed at us politely kindly and with eager interest
no one was impertinent
we could catch quite a bit of the talk now and all they said seemed pleasant enough
wellbefore nightfall we were all safely back in our big room
the damage we had done was quite ignored the beds as smooth and comfortable as before new clothing and towels supplied
the only thing those women did was to illuminate the gardens at night and to set an extra watch
but they called us to account next day
our three tutors who had not joined in the recapturing expedition had been quite busy in preparing for us and now made explanation
they knew well we would make for our machine and also that there was no other way of getting downalive
so our flight had troubled no one all they did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all along the edge of the forest between the two points
it appeared that many of those nights we had been seen by careful ladies sitting snugly in big trees by the riverbed or up among the rocks
terry looked immensely disgusted but it struck me as extremely funny
here we had been risking our lives hiding and prowling like outlaws living on nuts and fruit getting wet and cold at night and dry and hot by day and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting for us to come out
now they began to explain carefully using such words as we could understand
it appeared that we were considered as guests of the countrysort of public wards
our first violence had made it necessary to keep us safeguarded for a while but as soon as we learned the languageand would agree to do no harmthey would show us all about the land
jeff was eager to reassure them
of course he did not tell on terry but he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself and that he would now conform
as to the languagewe all fell upon it with redoubled energy
they brought us books in greater numbers and i began to study them seriously
pretty punk literature terry burst forth one day when we were in the privacy of our own room
of course one expects to begin on childstories but i would like something more interesting now cant expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men can you i asked
nothing irritated terry more than to have us assume that there were no men but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us or the pictures
shut up he growled
what infernal nonsense you talk
im going to ask em outrightwe know enough now in truth we had been using our best efforts to master the language and were able to read fluently and to discuss what we read with considerable ease
that afternoon we were all sitting together on the roofwe three and the tutors gathered about a table no guards about
we had been made to understand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence they would withdraw their constant attendance and we promised most willingly
so there we sat at ease all in similar dress our hair by now as long as theirs only our beards to distinguish us
we did not want those beards but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting instruments
ladies terry began out of a clear sky as it were are there no men in this country men somel answered
like you yes men terry indicated his beard and threw back his broad shoulders
men real men no she answered quietly
there are no men in this country
there has not been a man among us for two thousand years her look was clear and truthful and she did not advance this astonishing statement as if it was astonishing but quite as a matter of fact
butthe peoplethe children he protested not believing her in the least but not wishing to say so
oh yes she smiled
i do not wonder you are puzzled
we are mothersall of usbut there are no fathers
we thought you would ask about that long agowhy have you not her look was as frankly kind as always her tone quite simple
terry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language making rather a mess of it i thought but jeff was franker
will you excuse us all he said if we admit that we find it hard to believe
there is no suchpossibilityin the rest of the world have you no kind of life where it is possible asked zava
why yessome low forms of course how lowor how high rather wellthere are some rather high forms of insect life in which it occurs
parthenogenesis we call itthat means virgin birth she could not follow him
birth we know of course but what is virgin terry looked uncomfortable but jeff met the question quite calmly
among mating animals the term virgin is applied to the female who has not mated he answered
oh i see
and does it apply to the male also
or is there a different term for him he passed this over rather hurriedly saying that the same term would apply but was seldom used
no she said
but one cannot mate without the other surely
is not each thenvirginbefore mating
and tell me have you any forms of life in which there is birth from a father only i know of none he answered and i inquired seriously
you ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only women here and only girl babies born exactly answered somel nodding gravely
of course we know that among other animals it is not so that there are fathers as well as mothers and we see that you are fathers that you come from a people who are of both kinds
we have been waiting you see for you to be able to speak freely with us and teach us about your country and the rest of the world
you know so much you see and we know only our own land in the course of our previous studies we had been at some pains to tell them about the big world outside to draw sketches maps to make a globe even out of a spherical fruit and show the size and relation of the countries and to tell of the numbers of their people
all this had been scant and in outline but they quite understood
i find i succeed very poorly in conveying the impression i would like to of these women
so far from being ignorant they were deeply wisethat we realized more and more and for clear reasoning for real brain scope and power they were a no
but there were a lot of things they did not know
they had the evenest tempers the most perfect patience and good natureone of the things most impressive about them all was the absence of irritability
so far we had only this group to study but afterward i found it a common trait
we had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends and very capable ones at thatbut we couldnt form any opinion yet of the general level of these women
we want you to teach us all you can somel went on her firm shapely hands clasped on the table before her her clear quiet eyes meeting ours frankly
and we want to teach you what we have that is novel and useful
you can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us to have men among usafter two thousand years
and we want to know about your women what she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to terry
i could see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him
but when she spoke of our womensomeway i had a queer little indescribable feeling not like any feeling i ever had before when women were mentioned
will you tell us how it came about jeff pursued
you said for two thousand yearsdid you have men here before that yes answered zava
they were all quiet for a little
you should have our full history to readdo not be alarmedit has been made clear and short
it took us a long time to learn how to write history
oh how i should love to read yours she turned with flashing eager eyes looking from one to the other of us
it would be so wonderfulwould it not
to compare the history of two thousand years to see what the differences arebetween us who are only mothers and you who are mothers and fathers too
of course we see with our birds that the father is as useful as the mother almost
but among insects we find him of less importance sometimes very little
is it not so with you oh yes birds and bugs terry said but not among animalshave you no animals we have cats she said
the father is not very useful have you no cattlesheephorses i drew some rough outlines of these beasts and showed them to her
we had in the very old days these said somel and sketched with swift sure touches a sort of sheep or llama and thesedogs of two or three kinds that thatpointing to my absurd but recognizable horse
what became of them asked jeff
we do not want them anymore
they took up too much roomwe need all our land to feed our people
it is such a little country you know whatever do you do without milk terry demanded incredulously
milk we have milk in abundanceour own butbuti mean for cookingfor grown people terry blundered while they looked amazed and a shade displeased
jeff came to the rescue
we keep cattle for their milk as well as for their meat he explained
cows milk is a staple article of diet
there is a great milk industryto collect and distribute it still they looked puzzled
i pointed to my outline of a cow
the farmer milks the cow i said and sketched a milk pail the stool and in pantomime showed the man milking
then it is carried to the city and distributed by milkmeneverybody has it at the door in the morning has the cow no child asked somel earnestly
oh yes of course a calf that is is there milk for the calf and you too it took some time to make clear to those three sweetfaced women the process which robs the cow of her calf and the calf of its true food and the talk led us into a further discussion of the meat business
they heard it out looking very white and presently begged to be excused
a unique history it is no use for me to try to piece out this account with adventures
if the people who read it are not interested in these amazing women and their history they will not be interested at all
as for usthree young men to a whole landful of womenwhat could we do
we did get away as described and were peacefully brought back again without as terry complained even the satisfaction of hitting anybody
there were no adventures because there was nothing to fight
there were no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones
of these i might as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country
cats of course
but such cats
what do you suppose these lady burbanks had done with their cats
by the most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a race of cats that did not sing
thats a fact
the most those poor dumb brutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or wanted the door open and of course to purr and make the various mothernoises to their kittens
moreover they had ceased to kill birds
they were rigorously bred to destroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply but the birds were numerous and safe
while we were discussing birds terry asked them if they used feathers for their hats and they seemed amused at the idea
he made a few sketches of our womens hats with plumes and quills and those various tickling things that stick out so far and they were eagerly interested as at everything about our women
as for them they said they only wore hats for shade when working in the sun and those were big light straw hats something like those used in china and japan
in cold weather they wore caps or hoods
but for decorative purposesdont you think they would be becoming pursued terry making as pretty a picture as he could of a lady with a plumed hat
they by no means agreed to that asking quite simply if the men wore the same kind
we hastened to assure her that they did notdrew for them our kind of headgear
and do no men wear feathers in their hats only indians jeff explained
savages you know and he sketched a war bonnet to show them
and soldiers i added drawing a military hat with plumes
they never expressed horror or disapproval nor indeed much surprisejust a keen interest
and the notes they mademiles of them
but to return to our pussycats
we were a good deal impressed by this achievement in breeding and when they questioned usi can tell you we were well pumped for informationwe told of what had been done for dogs and horses and cattle but that there was no effort applied to cats except for show purposes
i wish i could represent the kind quiet steady ingenious way they questioned us
it was not just curiositythey werent a bit more curious about us than we were about them if as much
but they were bent on understanding our kind of civilization and their lines of interrogation would gradually surround us and drive us in till we found ourselves up against some admissions we did not want to make
are all these breeds of dogs you have made useful they asked
ohuseful
why the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are usefuland sleddogs of courseand ratters i suppose but we dont keep dogs for their usefulness
the dog is the friend of man we saywe love them that they understood
we love our cats that way
they surely are our friends and helpers too
you can see how intelligent and affectionate they are it was a fact
id never seen such cats except in a few rare instances
big handsome silky things friendly with everyone and devotedly attached to their special owners
you must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens we suggested
but they said oh no
you see we care for them as you do for your valuable cattle
the fathers are few compared to the mothers just a few very fine ones in each town they live quite happily in walled gardens and the houses of their friends
but they only have a mating season once a year rather hard on thomas isnt it suggested terry
oh notruly
you see it is many centuries that we have been breeding the kind of cats we wanted
they are healthy and happy and friendly as you see
how do you manage with your dogs
do you keep them in pairs or segregate the fathers or what then we explained thatwell that it wasnt a question of fathers exactly that nobody wanted aa mother dog that well that practically all our dogs were malesthere was only a very small percentage of females allowed to live
then zava observing terry with her grave sweet smile quoted back at him rather hard on thomas isnt it
do they enjoy itliving without mates
are your dogs as uniformly healthy and sweettempered as our cats jeff laughed eyeing terry mischievously
as a matter of fact we began to feel jeff something of a traitorhe so often flopped over and took their side of things also his medical knowledge gave him a different point of view somehow
im sorry to admit he told them that the dog with us is the most diseased of any animalnext to man
and as to temperthere are always some dogs who bite peopleespecially children that was pure malice
you see children were thethe raison dtre in this country
all our interlocutors sat up straight at once
they were still gentle still restrained but there was a note of deep amazement in their voices
do we understand that you keep an animalan unmated male animalthat bites children
about how many are there of them please thousandsin a large city said jeff and nearly every family has one in the country terry broke in at this
you must not imagine they are all dangerousits not one in a hundred that ever bites anybody
why they are the best friends of the childrena boy doesnt have half a chance that hasnt a dog to play with and the girls asked somel
ohgirlswhy they like them too he said but his voice flatted a little
they always noticed little things like that we found later
little by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man in the city was a prisoner was taken out for his meager exercise on a leash was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying horror of rabies and in many cases for the safety of the citizens had to go muzzled
jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known or read of injury and death from mad dogs
they did not scold or fuss about it
calm as judges those women were
but they made notes moadine read them to us
please tell me if i have the facts correct she said
in your countryand in others too yes we admitted in most civilized countries in most civilized countries a kind of animal is kept which is no longer useful they are a protection terry insisted
they bark if burglars try to get in then she made notes of burglars and went on because of the love which people bear to this animal zava interrupted here
is it the men or the women who love this animal so much both insisted terry
equally she inquired
and jeff said nonsense terryyou know men like dogs better than women doas a whole because they love it so muchespecially men
this animal is kept shut up or chained why suddenly asked somel
we keep our father cats shut up because we do not want too much fathering but they are not chainedthey have large grounds to run in a valuable dog would be stolen if he was let loose i said
we put collars on them with the owners name in case they do stray
besides they get into fightsa valuable dog might easily be killed by a bigger one i see she said
they fight when they meetis that common we admitted that it was
they are kept shut up or chained she paused again and asked is not a dog fond of running
are they not built for speed that we admitted too and jeff still malicious enlightened them further
ive always thought it was a pathetic sight both waysto see a man or a woman taking a dog to walkat the end of a string have you bred them to be as neat in their habits as cats are was the next question
and when jeff told them of the effect of dogs on sidewalk merchandise and the streets generally they found it hard to believe
you see their country was as neat as a dutch kitchen and as to sanitationbut i might as well start in now with as much as i can remember of the history of this amazing country before further description
and ill summarize here a bit as to our opportunities for learning it
i will not try to repeat the careful detailed account i lost ill just say that we were kept in that fortress a good six months all told and after that three in a pleasant enough city whereto terrys infinite disgustthere were only colonels and little childrenno young women whatever
then we were under surveillance for three morealways with a tutor or a guard or both
but those months were pleasant because we were really getting acquainted with the girls
that was a chapteror will bei will try to do justice to it
we learned their language pretty thoroughlyhad to and they learned ours much more quickly and used it to hasten our own studies
jeff who was never without reading matter of some sort had two little books with him a novel and a little anthology of verse and i had one of those pocket encyclopediasa fat little thing bursting with facts
these were used in our educationand theirs
then as soon as we were up to it they furnished us with plenty of their own books and i went in for the history parti wanted to understand the genesis of this miracle of theirs
and this is what happened according to their records
as to geographyat about the time of the christian era this land had a free passage to the sea
im not saying where for good reasons
but there was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us and there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of aryan stock and were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world
they were white but somewhat darker than our northern races because of their constant exposure to sun and air
the country was far larger then including much land beyond the pass and a strip of coast
they had ships commerce an army a kingfor at that time they were what they so calmly called usa bisexual race
what happened to them first was merely a succession of historic misfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough
they were decimated by war driven up from their coastline till finally the reduced population with many of the men killed in battle occupied this hinterland and defended it for years in the mountain passes
where it was open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural defenses so that it became unscalably secure as we found it
they were a polygamous people and a slaveholding people like all of their time and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend their mountain home they built the fortresses such as the one we were held in and other of their oldest buildings some still in use
nothing but earthquakes could destroy such architecturehuge solid blocks holding by their own weight
they must have had efficient workmen and enough of them in those days
they made a brave fight for their existence but no nation can stand up against what the steamship companies call an act of god while the whole fighting force was doing its best to defend their mountain pathway there occurred a volcanic outburst with some local tremors and the result was the complete filling up of the passtheir only outlet
instead of a passage a new ridge sheer and high stood between them and the sea they were walled in and beneath that wall lay their whole little army
very few men were left alive save the slaves and these now seized their opportunity rose in revolt killed their remaining masters even to the youngest boy killed the old women too and the mothers intending to take possession of the country with the remaining young women and girls
but this succession of misfortunes was too much for those infuriated virgins
there were many of them and but few of these wouldbe masters so the young women instead of submitting rose in sheer desperation and slew their brutal conquerors
this sounds like titus andronicus i know but that is their account
i suppose they were about crazycan you blame them
there was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a bunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women
that was about two thousand years ago
at first there was a period of sheer despair
the mountains towered between them and their old enemies but also between them and escape
there was no way up or down or outthey simply had to stay there
some were for suicide but not the majority
they must have been a plucky lot as a whole and they decided to liveas long as they did live
of course they had hope as youth must that something would happen to change their fate
so they set to work to bury the dead to plow and sow to care for one another
speaking of burying the dead i will set down while i think of it that they had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century for the same reason that they had left off raising cattlethey could not spare the room
they were much surprised to learn that we were still buryingasked our reasons for it and were much dissatisfied with what we gave
we told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body and they asked if our god was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as from long corruption
we told them of how people thought it repugnant to have their loved ones burn and they asked if it was less repugnant to have them decay
they were inconveniently reasonable those women
wellthat original bunch of girls set to work to clean up the place and make their living as best they could
some of the remaining slave women rendered invaluable service teaching such trades as they knew
they had such records as were then kept all the tools and implements of the time and a most fertile land to work in
there were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter and a few babies were born after the cataclysmbut only two boys and they both died
for five or ten years they worked together growing stronger and wiser and more and more mutually attached and then the miracle happenedone of these young women bore a child
of course they all thought there must be a man somewhere but none was found
then they decided it must be a direct gift from the gods and placed the proud mother in the temple of maaiatheir goddess of motherhoodunder strict watch
and there as years passed this wonderwoman bore child after child five of themall girls
i did my best keenly interested as i have always been in sociology and social psychology to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these ancient women
there were some five or six hundred of them and they were harembred yet for the few preceding generations they had been reared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must have been toughened somewhat
left alone in that terrific orphanhood they had clung together supporting one another and their little sisters and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity
to this painhardened and workstrengthened group who had lost not only the love and care of parents but the hope of ever having children of their own there now dawned the new hope
here at last was motherhood and though it was not for all of them personally it mightif the power was inheritedfound here a new race
it may be imagined how those five daughters of maaia children of the temple mothers of the futurethey had all the titles that love and hope and reverence could givewere reared
the whole little nation of women surrounded them with loving service and waited between a boundless hope and an equally boundless despair to see if they too would be mothers
and they were
as fast as they reached the age of twentyfive they began bearing
each of them like her mother bore five daughters
presently there were twentyfive new women mothers in their own right and the whole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous resignation to proud joy
the older women those who remembered men died off the youngest of all the first lot of course died too after a while and by that time there were left one hundred and fiftyfive parthenogenetic women founding a new race
they inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of original ones could leave them
their little country was quite safe
their farms and gardens were all in full production
such industries as they had were in careful order
the records of their past were all preserved and for years the older women had spent their time in the best teaching they were capable of that they might leave to the little group of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge
there you have the start of herland
one family all descended from one mother
she lived to a hundred years old lived to see her hundred and twentyfive greatgranddaughters born lived as queenpriestessmother of them all and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps any human soul has ever knownshe alone had founded a new race
the first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm of awed watchful waiting of breathless prayer
to them the longedfor motherhood was not only a personal joy but a nations hope
their twentyfive daughters in turn with a stronger hope a richer wider outlook with the devoted love and care of all the surviving population grew up as a holy sisterhood their whole ardent youth looking forward to their great office
and at last they were left alone the whitehaired first mother was gone and this one family five sisters twentyfive first cousins and a hundred and twentyfive second cousins began a new race
here you have human beings unquestionably but what we were slow in understanding was how these ultrawomen inheriting only from women had eliminated not only certain masculine characteristics which of course we did not look for but so much of what we had always thought essentially feminine
the tradition of men as guardians and protectors had quite died out
these stalwart virgins had no men to fear and therefore no need of protection
as to wild beaststhere were none in their sheltered land
the power of motherlove that maternal instinct we so highly laud was theirs of course raised to its highest power and a sisterlove which even while recognizing the actual relationship we found it hard to credit
terry incredulous even contemptuous when we were alone refused to believe the story
a lot of traditions as old as herodotusand about as trustworthy he said
its likely womenjust a pack of womenwould have hung together like that
we all know women cant organizethat they scrap like anythingare frightfully jealous but these new ladies didnt have anyone to be jealous of remember drawled jeff
thats a likely story terry sneered
why dont you invent a likelier one i asked him
here are the womennothing but women and you yourself admit theres no trace of a man in the country this was after we had been about a good deal
ill admit that he growled
and its a big miss too
theres not only no fun without emno real sportno competition but these women arent womanly
you know they arent that kind of talk always set jeff going and i gradually grew to side with him
then you dont call a breed of women whose one concern is motherhoodwomanly he asked
indeed i dont snapped terry
what does a man care for motherhoodwhen he hasnt a ghost of a chance at fatherhood
and besideswhats the good of talking sentiment when we are just men together
what a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this motherhood we were as patient as possible with terry
he had lived about nine months among the colonels when he made that outburst and with no chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave ussave for our escape fiasco
i dont suppose terry had ever lived so long with neither love combat nor danger to employ his superabundant energies and he was irritable
neither jeff nor i found it so wearing
i was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not wear on me and as for jeff bless his hearthe enjoyed the society of that tutor of his almost as much as if she had been a girli dont know but more
as to terrys criticism it was true
these women whose essential distinction of motherhood was the dominant note of their whole culture were strikingly deficient in what we call femininity this led me very promptly to the conviction that those feminine charms we are so fond of are not feminine at all but mere reflected masculinitydeveloped to please us because they had to please us and in no way essential to the real fulfillment of their great process
but terry came to no such conclusion
just you wait till i get out he muttered
then we both cautioned him
look here terry my boy
you be careful
theyve been mighty good to usbut do you remember the anesthesia
if you do any mischief in this virgin land beware of the vengeance of the maiden aunts
come be a man
it wont be forever to return to the history they began at once to plan and built for their children all the strength and intelligence of the whole of them devoted to that one thing
each girl of course was reared in full knowledge of her crowning office and they had even then very high ideas of the molding powers of the mother as well as those of education
such high ideals as they had
beauty health strength intellect goodnessfor those they prayed and worked
they had no enemies they themselves were all sisters and friends
the land was fair before them and a great future began to form itself in their minds
the religion they had to begin with was much like that of old greecea number of gods and goddesses but they lost all interest in deities of war and plunder and gradually centered on their mother goddess altogether
then as they grew more intelligent this had turned into a sort of maternal pantheism
here was mother earth bearing fruit
all that they ate was fruit of motherhood from seed or egg or their product
by motherhood they were born and by motherhood they livedlife was to them just the long cycle of motherhood
but very early they recognized the need of improvement as well as of mere repetition and devoted their combined intelligence to that problemhow to make the best kind of people
first this was merely the hope of bearing better ones and then they recognized that however the children differed at birth the real growth lay laterthrough education
then things began to hum
as i learned more and more to appreciate what these women had accomplished the less proud i was of what we with all our manhood had done
you see they had had no wars
they had had no kings and no priests and no aristocracies
they were sisters and as they grew they grew togethernot by competition but by united action
we tried to put in a good word for competition and they were keenly interested
indeed we soon found from their earnest questions of us that they were prepared to believe our world must be better than theirs
they were not sure they wanted to know but there was no such arrogance about them as might have been expected
we rather spread ourselves telling of the advantages of competition how it developed fine qualities that without it there would be no stimulus to industry terry was very strong on that point
no stimulus to industry they repeated with that puzzled look we had learned to know so well
stimulus
to industry but dont you like to work no man would work unless he had to terry declared
oh no man you mean that is one of your sex distinctions no indeed he said hastily
no one i mean man or woman would work without incentive
competition is thethe motor power you see it is not with us they explained gently so it is hard for us to understand
do you mean for instance that with you no mother would work for her children without the stimulus of competition no he admitted that he did not mean that
mothers he supposed would of course work for their children in the home but the worlds work was differentthat had to be done by men and required the competitive element
all our teachers were eagerly interested
we want so much to knowyou have the whole world to tell us of and we have only our little land
and there are two of youthe two sexesto love and help one another
it must be a rich and wonderful world
tell uswhat is the work of the world that men dowhich we have not here oh everything terry said grandly
the men do everything with us he squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest
we do not allow our women to work
women are lovedidolizedhonoredkept in the home to care for the children what is the home asked somel a little wistfully
but zava begged tell me first do no women work really why yes terry admitted
some have to of the poorer sort about how manyin your country about seven or eight million said jeff as mischievous as ever
comparisons are odious i had always been proud of my country of course
everyone is
compared with the other lands and other races i knew the united states of america had always seemed to me speaking modestly as good as the best of them
but just as a cleareyed intelligent perfectly honest and wellmeaning child will frequently jar ones selfesteem by innocent questions so did these women without the slightest appearance of malice or satire continually bring up points of discussion which we spent our best efforts in evading
now that we were fairly proficient in their language had read a lot about their history and had given them the general outlines of ours they were able to press their questions closer
so when jeff admitted the number of women wage earners we had they instantly asked for the total population for the proportion of adult women and found that there were but twenty million or so at the outside
then at least a third of your women arewhat is it you call themwage earners
and they are all poor
what is poor exactly ours is the best country in the world as to poverty terry told them
we do not have the wretched paupers and beggars of the older countries i assure you
why european visitors tell us we dont know what poverty is neither do we answered zava
wont you tell us terry put it up to me saying i was the sociologist and i explained that the laws of nature require a struggle for existence and that in the struggle the fittest survive and the unfit perish
in our economic struggle i continued there was always plenty of opportunity for the fittest to reach the top which they did in great numbers particularly in our country that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest classes of course felt it the worst and that among the poorest of all the women were driven into the labor market by necessity
they listened closely with the usual notetaking
about onethird then belong to the poorest class observed moadine gravely
and twothirds are the ones who arehow was it you so beautifully put itloved honored kept in the home to care for the children this inferior onethird have no children i suppose jeffhe was getting as bad as they weresolemnly replied that on the contrary the poorer they were the more children they had
that too he explained was a law of nature reproduction is in inverse proportion to individuation these laws of nature zava gently asked are they all the laws you have i should say not protested terry
we have systems of law that go back thousands and thousands of yearsjust as you do no doubt he finished politely
oh no moadine told him
we have no laws over a hundred years old and most of them are under twenty
in a few weeks more she continued we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land and explaining everything you care to know about
we want you to see our people and i assure you somel added that our people want to see you terry brightened up immensely at this news and reconciled himself to the renewed demands upon our capacity as teachers
it was lucky that we knew so little really and had no books to refer to else i fancy we might all be there yet teaching those eagerminded women about the rest of the world
as to geography they had the tradition of the great sea beyond the mountains and they could see for themselves the endless thickforested plains below themthat was all
but from the few records of their ancient conditionnot before the flood with them but before that mighty quake which had cut them off so completelythey were aware that there were other peoples and other countries
in geology they were quite ignorant
as to anthropology they had those same remnants of information about other peoples and the knowledge of the savagery of the occupants of those dim forests below
nevertheless they had inferred marvelously keen on inference and deduction their minds were
the existence and development of civilization in other places much as we infer it on other planets
when our biplane came whirring over their heads in that first scouting flight of ours they had instantly accepted it as proof of the high development of some where else and had prepared to receive us as cautiously and eagerly as we might prepare to welcome visitors who came by meteor from mars
of historyoutside their ownthey knew nothing of course save for their ancient traditions
of astronomy they had a fair working knowledgethat is a very old science and with it a surprising range and facility in mathematics
physiology they were quite familiar with
indeed when it came to the simpler and more concrete sciences wherein the subject matter was at hand and they had but to exercise their minds upon it the results were surprising
they had worked out a chemistry a botany a physics with all the blends where a science touches an art or merges into an industry to such fullness of knowledge as made us feel like schoolchildren
also we found this outas soon as we were free of the country and by further study and questionthat what one knew all knew to a very considerable extent
i talked later with little mountain girls from the firdark valleys away up at their highest part and with sunburned plainswomen and agile foresters all over the country as well as those in the towns and everywhere there was the same high level of intelligence
some knew far more than others about one thingthey were specialized of course but all of them knew more about everythingthat is about everything the country was acquainted withthan is the case with us
we boast a good deal of our high level of general intelligence and our compulsory public education but in proportion to their opportunities they were far better educated than our people
with what we told them from what sketches and models we were able to prepare they constructed a sort of working outline to fill in as they learned more
a big globe was made and our uncertain maps helped out by those in that precious yearbook thing i had were tentatively indicated upon it
they sat in eager groups masses of them who came for the purpose and listened while jeff roughly ran over the geologic history of the earth and showed them their own land in relation to the others
out of that same pocket reference book of mine came facts and figures which were seized upon and placed in right relation with unerring acumen
even terry grew interested in this work
if we can keep this up theyll be having us lecture to all the girls schools and collegeshow about that he suggested to us
dont know as id object to being an authority to such audiences they did in fact urge us to give public lectures later but not to the hearers or with the purpose we expected
what they were doing with us was likelikewell say like napoleon extracting military information from a few illiterate peasants
they knew just what to ask and just what use to make of it they had mechanical appliances for disseminating information almost equal to ours at home and by the time we were led forth to lecture our audiences had thoroughly mastered a wellarranged digest of all we had previously given to our teachers and were prepared with such notes and questions as might have intimidated a university professor
they were not audiences of girls either
it was some time before we were allowed to meet the young women
do you mind telling what you intend to do with us terry burst forth one day facing the calm and friendly moadine with that funny halfblustering air of his
at first he used to storm and flourish quite a good deal but nothing seemed to amuse them more they would gather around and watch him as if it was an exhibition politely but with evident interest
so he learned to check himself and was almost reasonable in his bearingbut not quite
she announced smoothly and evenly not in the least
i thought it was quite plain
we are trying to learn of you all we can and to teach you what you are willing to learn of our country is that all he insisted
she smiled a quiet enigmatic smile
that depends depends on what mainly on yourselves she replied
why do you keep us shut up so closely because we do not feel quite safe in allowing you at large where there are so many young women terry was really pleased at that
he had thought as much inwardly but he pushed the question
why should you be afraid
we are gentlemen she smiled that little smile again and asked are gentlemen always safe you surely do not think that any of us he said it with a good deal of emphasis on the us would hurt your young girls oh no she said quickly in real surprise
the danger is quite the other way
they might hurt you
if by any accident you did harm any one of us you would have to face a million mothers he looked so amazed and outraged that jeff and i laughed outright but she went on gently
i do not think you quite understand yet
you are but men three men in a country where the whole population are mothersor are going to be
motherhood means to us something which i cannot yet discover in any of the countries of which you tell us
you have spokenshe turned to jeff of human brotherhood as a great idea among you but even that i judge is far from a practical expression jeff nodded rather sadly
very far he said
here we have human motherhoodin full working use she went on
nothing else except the literal sisterhood of our origin and the far higher and deeper union of our social growth
the children in this country are the one center and focus of all our thoughts
every step of our advance is always considered in its effect on themon the race
you see we are mothers she repeated as if in that she had said it all
i dont see how that factwhich is shared by all womenconstitutes any risk to us terry persisted
you mean they would defend their children from attack
of course
any mothers would
but we are not savages my dear lady we are not going to hurt any mothers child they looked at one another and shook their heads a little but zava turned to jeff and urged him to make us seesaid he seemed to understand more fully than we did
and he tried
i can see it now or at least much more of it but it has taken me a long time and a good deal of honest intellectual effort
what they call motherhood was like this they began with a really high degree of social development something like that of ancient egypt or greece
then they suffered the loss of everything masculine and supposed at first that all human power and safety had gone too
then they developed this virgin birth capacity
then since the prosperity of their children depended on it the fullest and subtlest coordination began to be practiced
i remember how long terry balked at the evident unanimity of these womenthe most conspicuous feature of their whole culture
its impossible he would insist
women cannot cooperateits against nature when we urged the obvious facts he would say fiddlesticks or hang your factsi tell you it cant be done and we never succeeded in shutting him up till jeff dragged in the hymenoptera
go to the ant thou sluggardand learn something he said triumphantly
dont they cooperate pretty well
you cant beat it
this place is just like an enormous anthillyou know an anthill is nothing but a nursery
and how about bees
dont they manage to cooperate and love one another
as the birds do love the spring or the bees their careful king as that precious constable had it
just show me a combination of male creatures bird bug or beast that works as well will you
or one of our masculine countries where the people work together as well as they do here
i tell you women are the natural cooperators not men terry had to learn a good many things he did not want to
to go back to my little analysis of what happened they developed all this close interservice in the interests of their children
to do the best work they had to specialize of course the children needed spinners and weavers farmers and gardeners carpenters and masons as well as mothers
then came the filling up of the place
when a population multiplies by five every thirty years it soon reaches the limits of a country especially a small one like this
they very soon eliminated all the grazing cattlesheep were the last to go i believe
also they worked out a system of intensive agriculture surpassing anything i ever heard of with the very forests all reset with fruit or nutbearing trees
do what they would however there soon came a time when they were confronted with the problem of the pressure of population in an acute form
there was really crowding and with it unavoidably a decline in standards
and how did those women meet it
not by a struggle for existence which would result in an everlasting writhing mass of underbred people trying to get ahead of one anothersome few on top temporarily many constantly crushed out underneath a hopeless substratum of paupers and degenerates and no serenity or peace for anyone no possibility for really noble qualities among the people at large
neither did they start off on predatory excursions to get more land from somebody else or to get more food from somebody else to maintain their struggling mass
not at all
they sat down in council together and thought it out
very clear strong thinkers they were
they said with our best endeavors this country will support about so many people with the standard of peace comfort health beauty and progress we demand
very well
that is all the people we will make there you have it
you see they were mothers not in our sense of helpless involuntary fecundity forced to fill and overfill the land every land and then see their children suffer sin and die fighting horribly with one another but in the sense of conscious makers of people
motherlove with them was not a brute passion a mere instinct a wholly personal feeling it wasa religion
it included that limitless feeling of sisterhood that wide unity in service which was so difficult for us to grasp
and it was national racial humanoh i dont know how to say it
we are used to seeing what we call a mother completely wrapped up in her own pink bundle of fascinating babyhood and taking but the faintest theoretic interest in anybody elses bundle to say nothing of the common needs of all the bundles
but these women were working all together at the grandest of tasksthey were making peopleand they made them well
there followed a period of negative eugenics which must have been an appalling sacrifice
we are commonly willing to lay down our lives for our country but they had to forego motherhood for their countryand it was precisely the hardest thing for them to do
when i got this far in my reading i went to somel for more light
we were as friendly by that time as i had ever been in my life with any woman
a mighty comfortable soul she was giving one the nice smooth motherfeeling a man likes in a woman and yet giving also the clear intelligence and dependableness i used to assume to be masculine qualities
we had talked volumes already
see here said i
here was this dreadful period when they got far too thick and decided to limit the population
we have a lot of talk about that among us but your position is so different that id like to know a little more about it
i understand that you make motherhood the highest social servicea sacrament really that it is only undertaken once by the majority of the population that those held unfit are not allowed even that and that to be encouraged to bear more than one child is the very highest reward and honor in the power of the state she interpolated here that the nearest approach to an aristocracy they had was to come of a line of over mothersthose who had been so honored
but what i do not understand naturally is how you prevent it
i gathered that each woman had five
you have no tyrannical husbands to hold in checkand you surely do not destroy the unborn the look of ghastly horror she gave me i shall never forget
she started from her chair pale her eyes blazing
destroy the unborn she said in a hard whisper
do men do that in your country men i began to answer rather hotly and then saw the gulf before me
none of us wanted these women to think that our women of whom we boasted so proudly were in any way inferior to them
i am ashamed to say that i equivocated
i told her of certain criminal types of womenperverts or crazy who had been known to commit infanticide
i told her truly enough that there was much in our land which was open to criticism but that i hated to dwell on our defects until they understood us and our conditions better
and making a wide detour i scrambled back to my question of how they limited the population
as for somel she seemed sorry a little ashamed even of her too clearly expressed amazement
as i look back now knowing them better i am more and more and more amazed as i appreciate the exquisite courtesy with which they had received over and over again statements and admissions on our part which must have revolted them to the soul
she explained to me with sweet seriousness that as i had supposed at first each woman bore five children and that in their eager desire to build up a nation they had gone on in that way for a few centuries till they were confronted with the absolute need of a limit
this fact was equally plain to allall were equally interested
they were now as anxious to check their wonderful power as they had been to develop it and for some generations gave the matter their most earnest thought and study
we were living on rations before we worked it out she said
but we did work it out
you see before a child comes to one of us there is a period of utter exaltationthe whole being is uplifted and filled with a concentrated desire for that child
we learned to look forward to that period with the greatest caution
often our young women those to whom motherhood had not yet come would voluntarily defer it
when that deep inner demand for a child began to be felt she would deliberately engage in the most active work physical and mental and even more important would solace her longing by the direct care and service of the babies we already had she paused
her wise sweet face grew deeply reverently tender
we soon grew to see that motherlove has more than one channel of expression
i think the reason our children are soso fully loved by all of us is that we neverany of ushave enough of our own this seemed to me infinitely pathetic and i said so
we have much that is bitter and hard in our life at home i told her but this seems to me piteous beyond wordsa whole nation of starving mothers but she smiled her deep contented smile and said i quite misunderstood
we each go without a certain range of personal joy she said but rememberwe each have a million children to love and serveour children it was beyond me
to hear a lot of women talk about our children
but i suppose that is the way the ants and bees would talkdo talk maybe
that was what they did anyhow
when a woman chose to be a mother she allowed the childlonging to grow within her till it worked its natural miracle
when she did not so choose she put the whole thing out of her mind and fed her heart with the other babies
let me seewith us childrenminors that isconstitute about threefifths of the population with them only about onethird or less
and precious
no sole heir to an empires throne no solitary millionaire baby no only child of middleaged parents could compare as an idol with these herland children
but before i start on that subject i must finish up that little analysis i was trying to make
they did effectually and permanently limit the population in numbers so that the country furnished plenty for the fullest richest life for all of them plenty of everything including room air solitude even
and then they set to work to improve that population in qualitysince they were restricted in quantity
this they had been at work on uninterruptedly for some fifteen hundred years
do you wonder they were nice people
physiology hygiene sanitation physical cultureall that line of work had been perfected long since
sickness was almost wholly unknown among them so much so that a previously high development in what we call the science of medicine had become practically a lost art
they were a cleanbred vigorous lot having the best of care the most perfect living conditions always
when it came to psychologythere was no one thing which left us so dumbfounded so really awed as the everyday working knowledgeand practicethey had in this line
as we learned more and more of it we learned to appreciate the exquisite mastery with which we ourselves strangers of alien race of unknown opposite sex had been understood and provided for from the first
with this wide deep thorough knowledge they had met and solved the problems of education in ways some of which i hope to make clear later
those nationloved children of theirs compared with the average in our country as the most perfectly cultivated richly developed roses compare withtumbleweeds
yet they did not seem cultivated at allit had all become a natural condition
and this people steadily developing in mental capacity in will power in social devotion had been playing with the arts and sciencesas far as they knew themfor a good many centuries now with inevitable success
into this quiet lovely land among these wise sweet strong women we in our easy assumption of superiority had suddenly arrived and now tamed and trained to a degree they considered safe we were at last brought out to see the country to know the people
our growing modesty being at last considered sufficiently tamed and trained to be trusted with scissors we barbered ourselves as best we could
a closetrimmed beard is certainly more comfortable than a full one
razors naturally they could not supply
with so many old women youd think thered be some razors sneered terry
whereat jeff pointed out that he never before had seen such complete absence of facial hair on women
looks to me as if the absence of men made them more feminine in that regard anyhow he suggested
well its the only one then terry reluctantly agreed
a less feminine lot i never saw
a child apiece doesnt seem to be enough to develop what i call motherliness terrys idea of motherliness was the usual one involving a baby in arms or a little flock about her knees and the complete absorption of the mother in said baby or flock
a motherliness which dominated society which influenced every art and industry which absolutely protected all childhood and gave to it the most perfect care and training did not seem motherlyto terry
we had become well used to the clothes
they were quite as comfortable as our ownin some ways more soand undeniably better looking
as to pockets they left nothing to be desired
that second garment was fairly quilted with pockets
they were most ingeniously arranged so as to be convenient to the hand and not inconvenient to the body and were so placed as at once to strengthen the garment and add decorative lines of stitching
in this as in so many other points we had now to observe there was shown the action of a practical intelligence coupled with fine artistic feeling and apparently untrammeled by any injurious influences
our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of the country
no pentagonal bodyguard now
only our special tutors and we got on famously with them
jeff said he loved zava like an auntonly jollier than any aunt i ever saw somel and i were as chummy as could bethe best of friends but it was funny to watch terry and moadine
she was patient with him and courteous but it was like the patience and courtesy of some great man say a skilled experienced diplomat with a schoolgirl
her grave acquiescence with his most preposterous expression of feeling her genial laughter not only with but i often felt at himthough impeccably polite her innocent questions which almost invariably led him to say more than he intendedjeff and i found it all amusing to watch
he never seemed to recognize that quiet background of superiority
when she dropped an argument he always thought he had silenced her when she laughed he thought it tribute to his wit
i hated to admit to myself how much terry had sunk in my esteem
jeff felt it too i am sure but neither of us admitted it to the other
at home we had measured him with other men and though we knew his failings he was by no means an unusual type
we knew his virtues too and they had always seemed more prominent than the faults
measured among womenour women at home i meanhe had always stood high
he was visibly popular
even where his habits were known there was no discrimination against him in some cases his reputation for what was felicitously termed gaiety seemed a special charm
but here against the calm wisdom and quiet restrained humor of these women with only that blessed jeff and my inconspicuous self to compare with terry did stand out rather strong
as a man among men he didnt as a man amongi shall have to say females he didnt his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement to their intense femininity
but here he was all out of drawing
moadine was a big woman with a balanced strength that seldom showed
her eye was as quietly watchful as a fencers
she maintained a pleasant relation with her charge but i doubt if many even in that country could have done as well
he called her maud amongst ourselves and said she was a good old soul but a little slow wherein he was quite wrong
needless to say he called jeffs teacher java and sometimes mocha or plain coffee when specially mischievous chicory and even postum but somel rather escaped this form of humor save for a rather forced some ell dont you people have but one name he asked one day after we had been introduced to a whole group of them all with pleasant fewsyllabled strange names like the ones we knew
oh yes moadine told him
a good many of us have another as we get on in lifea descriptive one
that is the name we earn
sometimes even that is changed or added to in an unusually rich life
such as our present land motherwhat you call president or king i believe
she was called mera even as a child that means thinker later there was added dudumerathe wise thinker and now we all know her as odumeragreat and wise thinker
you shall meet her no surnames at all then pursued terry with his somewhat patronizing air
no family name why no she said
why should we
we are all descended from a common sourceall one family in reality
you see our comparatively brief and limited history gives us that advantage at least but does not each mother want her own child to bear her name i asked
nowhy should she
the child has its own why forfor identificationso people will know whose child she is we keep the most careful records said somel
each one of us has our exact line of descent all the way back to our dear first mother
there are many reasons for doing that
but as to everyone knowing which child belongs to which motherwhy should she here as in so many other instances we were led to feel the difference between the purely maternal and the paternal attitude of mind
the element of personal pride seemed strangely lacking
how about your other works asked jeff
dont you sign your names to thembooks and statues and so on yes surely we are all glad and proud to
not only books and statues but all kinds of work
you will find little names on the houses on the furniture on the dishes sometimes
because otherwise one is likely to forget and we want to know to whom to be grateful you speak as if it were done for the convenience of the consumernot the pride of the producer i suggested
its both said somel
we have pride enough in our work then why not in your children urged jeff
but we have
were magnificently proud of them she insisted
then why not sign em said terry triumphantly
moadine turned to him with her slightly quizzical smile
because the finished product is not a private one
when they are babies we do speak of them at times as essas lato or novines amel but that is merely descriptive and conversational
in the records of course the child stands in her own line of mothers but in dealing with it personally it is lato or amel without dragging in its ancestors but have you names enough to give a new one to each child assuredly we have for each living generation then they asked about our methods and found first that we did so and so and then that other nations did differently
upon which they wanted to know which method has been proved bestand we had to admit that so far as we knew there had been no attempt at comparison each people pursuing its own custom in the fond conviction of superiority and either despising or quite ignoring the others
with these women the most salient quality in all their institutions was reasonableness
when i dug into the records to follow out any line of development that was the most astonishing thingthe conscious effort to make it better
they had early observed the value of certain improvements had easily inferred that there was room for more and took the greatest pains to develop two kinds of mindsthe critic and inventor
those who showed an early tendency to observe to discriminate to suggest were given special training for that function and some of their highest officials spent their time in the most careful study of one or another branch of work with a view to its further improvement
in each generation there was sure to arrive some new mind to detect faults and show need of alterations and the whole corps of inventors was at hand to apply their special faculty at the point criticized and offer suggestions
we had learned by this time not to open a discussion on any of their characteristics without first priming ourselves to answer questions about our own methods so i kept rather quiet on this matter of conscious improvement
we were not prepared to show our way was better
there was growing in our minds at least in jeffs and mine a keen appreciation of the advantages of this strange country and its management
terry remained critical
we laid most of it to his nerves
he certainly was irritable
the most conspicuous feature of the whole land was the perfection of its food supply
we had begun to notice from that very first walk in the forest the first partial view from our plane
now we were taken to see this mighty garden and shown its methods of culture
the country was about the size of holland some ten or twelve thousand square miles
one could lose a good many hollands along the forestsmothered flanks of those mighty mountains
they had a population of about three millionnot a large one but quality is something
three million is quite enough to allow for considerable variation and these people varied more widely than we could at first account for
terry had insisted that if they were parthenogenetic theyd be as alike as so many ants or aphids he urged their visible differences as proof that there must be mensomewhere
but when we asked them in our later more intimate conversations how they accounted for so much divergence without crossfertilization they attributed it partly to the careful education which followed each slight tendency to differ and partly to the law of mutation
this they had found in their work with plants and fully proven in their own case
physically they were more alike than we as they lacked all morbid or excessive types
they were tall strong healthy and beautiful as a race but differed individually in a wide range of feature coloring and expression
but surely the most important growth is in mindand in the things we make urged somel
do you find your physical variation accompanied by a proportionate variation in ideas feelings and products
or among people who look more alike do you find their internal life and their work as similar we were rather doubtful on this point and inclined to hold that there was more chance of improvement in greater physical variation
it certainly should be zava admitted
we have always thought it a grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world
perhaps that is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement but acquired traits are not transmissible terry declared
weissman has proved that they never disputed our absolute statements only made notes of them
if that is so then our improvement must be due either to mutation or solely to education she gravely pursued
we certainly have improved
it may be that all these higher qualities were latent in the original mother that careful education is bringing them out and that our personal differences depend on slight variations in prenatal condition i think it is more in your accumulated culture jeff suggested
and in the amazing psychic growth you have made
we know very little about methods of real soul cultureand you seem to know a great deal be that as it might they certainly presented a higher level of active intelligence and of behavior than we had so far really grasped
having known in our lives several people who showed the same delicate courtesy and were equally pleasant to live with at least when they wore their company manners we had assumed that our companions were a carefully chosen few
later we were more and more impressed that all this gentle breeding was breeding that they were born to it reared in it that it was as natural and universal with them as the gentleness of doves or the alleged wisdom of serpents
as for the intelligence i confess that this was the most impressive and to me most mortifying of any single feature of herland
we soon ceased to comment on this or other matters which to them were such obvious commonplaces as to call forth embarrassing questions about our own conditions
this was nowhere better shown than in that matter of food supply which i will now attempt to describe
having improved their agriculture to the highest point and carefully estimated the number of persons who could comfortably live on their square miles having then limited their population to that number one would think that was all there was to be done
but they had not thought so
to them the country was a unitit was theirs
they themselves were a unit a conscious group they thought in terms of the community
as such their timesense was not limited to the hopes and ambitions of an individual life
therefore they habitually considered and carried out plans for improvement which might cover centuries
i had never seen had scarcely imagined human beings undertaking such a work as the deliberate replanting of an entire forest area with different kinds of trees
yet this seemed to them the simplest common sense like a mans plowing up an inferior lawn and reseeding it
now every tree bore fruitedible fruit that is
in the case of one tree in which they took especial pride it had originally no fruit at allthat is none humanly edibleyet was so beautiful that they wished to keep it
for nine hundred years they had experimented and now showed us this particularly lovely graceful tree with a profuse crop of nutritious seeds
they had early decided that trees were the best food plants requiring far less labor in tilling the soil and bearing a larger amount of food for the same ground space also doing much to preserve and enrich the soil
due regard had been paid to seasonable crops and their fruit and nuts grains and berries kept on almost the year through
on the higher part of the country near the backing wall of mountains they had a real winter with snow
toward the southeastern point where there was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean the climate was like that of california and citrus fruits figs and olives grew abundantly
what impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization
here was this little shutin piece of land where one would have thought an ordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an annual struggle for life
these careful culturists had worked out a perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it
all the scraps and leavings of their food plant waste from lumber work or textile industry all the solid matter from the sewage properly treated and combinedeverything which came from the earth went back to it
the practical result was like that in any healthy forest an increasingly valuable soil was being built instead of the progressive impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world
when this first burst upon us we made such approving comments that they were surprised that such obvious common sense should be praised asked what our methods were and we had some difficulty inwell in diverting them by referring to the extent of our own land and theadmittedcarelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it
at least we thought we had diverted them
later i found that besides keeping a careful and accurate account of all we told them they had a sort of skeleton chart on which the things we said and the things we palpably avoided saying were all set down and studied
it really was childs play for those profound educators to work out a painfully accurate estimate of our conditionsin some lines
when a given line of observation seemed to lead to some very dreadful inference they always gave us the benefit of the doubt leaving it open to further knowledge
some of the things we had grown to accept as perfectly natural or as belonging to our human limitations they literally could not have believed and as i have said we had all of us joined in a tacit endeavor to conceal much of the social status at home
confound their grandmotherly minds terry said
of course they cant understand a mans world
they arent humantheyre just a pack of fefefemales this was after he had to admit their parthenogenesis
i wish our grandfatherly minds had managed as well said jeff
do you really think its to our credit that we have muddled along with all our poverty and disease and the like
they have peace and plenty wealth and beauty goodness and intellect
pretty good people i think youll find they have their faults too terry insisted and partly in selfdefense we all three began to look for those faults of theirs
we had been very strong on this subject before we got therein those baseless speculations of ours
suppose there is a country of women only jeff had put it over and over
whatll they be like and we had been cocksure as to the inevitable limitations the faults and vices of a lot of women
we had expected them to be given over to what we called feminine vanityfrills and furbelows and we found they had evolved a costume more perfect than the chinese dress richly beautiful when so desired always useful of unfailing dignity and good taste
we had expected a dull submissive monotony and found a daring social inventiveness far beyond our own and a mechanical and scientific development fully equal to ours
we had expected pettiness and found a social consciousness besides which our nations looked like quarreling childrenfeebleminded ones at that
we had expected jealousy and found a broad sisterly affection a fairminded intelligence to which we could produce no parallel
we had expected hysteria and found a standard of health and vigor a calmness of temper to which the habit of profanity for instance was impossible to explainwe tried it
all these things even terry had to admit but he still insisted that we should find out the other side pretty soon
it stands to reason doesnt it he argued
the whole things deuced unnaturalid say impossible if we werent in it
and an unnatural conditions sure to have unnatural results
youll find some awful characteristicssee if you dont
for instancewe dont know yet what they do with their criminalstheir defectivestheir aged
you notice we havent seen any
theres got to be something i was inclined to believe that there had to be something so i took the bull by the hornsthe cow i should sayand asked somel
i want to find some flaw in all this perfection i told her flatly
it simply isnt possible that three million people have no faults
we are trying our best to understand and learnwould you mind helping us by saying what to your minds are the worst qualities of this unique civilization of yours we were sitting together in a shaded arbor in one of those eatinggardens of theirs
the delicious food had been eaten a plate of fruit still before us
we could look out on one side over a stretch of open country quietly rich and lovely on the other the garden with tables here and there far apart enough for privacy
let me say right here that with all their careful balance of population there was no crowding in this country
there was room space a sunny breezy freedom everywhere
somel set her chin upon her hand her elbow on the low wall beside her and looked off over the fair land
of course we have faultsall of us she said
in one way you might say that we have more than we used tothat is our standard of perfection seems to get farther and farther away
but we are not discouraged because our records do show gainconsiderable gain
when we beganeven with the start of one particularly noble motherwe inherited the characteristics of a long racerecord behind her
and they cropped out from time to timealarmingly
but it isyes quite six hundred years since we have had what you call a criminal we have of course made it our first business to train out to breed out when possible the lowest types breed out i asked
how could youwith parthenogenesis if the girl showing the bad qualities had still the power to appreciate social duty we appealed to her by that to renounce motherhood
some of the few worst types were fortunately unable to reproduce
but if the fault was in a disproportionate egotismthen the girl was sure she had the right to have children even that hers would be better than others i can see that i said
and then she would be likely to rear them in the same spirit that we never allowed answered somel quietly
allowed i queried
allowed a mother to rear her own children certainly not said somel unless she was fit for that supreme task this was rather a blow to my previous convictions
but i thought motherhood was for each of you motherhoodyes that is maternity to bear a child
but education is our highest art only allowed to our highest artists education i was puzzled again
i dont mean education
i mean by motherhood not only childbearing but the care of babies the care of babies involves education and is entrusted only to the most fit she repeated
then you separate mother and child i cried in cold horror something of terrys feeling creeping over me that there must be something wrong among these many virtues
not usually she patiently explained
you see almost every woman values her maternity above everything else
each girl holds it close and dear an exquisite joy a crowning honor the most intimate most personal most precious thing
that is the childrearing has come to be with us a culture so profoundly studied practiced with such subtlety and skill that the more we love our children the less we are willing to trust that process to unskilled handseven our own but a mothers love i ventured
she studied my face trying to work out a means of clear explanation
you told us about your dentists she said at length those quaintly specialized persons who spend their lives filling little holes in other persons teetheven in childrens teeth sometimes yes i said not getting her drift
does motherlove urge motherswith youto fill their own childrens teeth
or to wish to why noof course not i protested
but that is a highly specialized craft
surely the care of babies is open to any womanany mother we do not think so she gently replied
those of us who are the most highly competent fulfill that office and a majority of our girls eagerly try for iti assure you we have the very best but the poor motherbereaved of her baby oh no she earnestly assured me
not in the least bereaved
it is her baby stillit is with hershe has not lost it
but she is not the only one to care for it
there are others whom she knows to be wiser
she knows it because she has studied as they did practiced as they did and honors their real superiority
for the childs sake she is glad to have for it this highest care i was unconvinced
besides this was only hearsay i had yet to see the motherhood of herland
the girls of herland at last terrys ambition was realized
we were invited always courteously and with free choice on our part to address general audiences and classes of girls
i remember the first timeand how careful we were about our clothes and our amateur barbering
terry in particular was fussy to a degree about the cut of his beard and so critical of our combined efforts that we handed him the shears and told him to please himself
we began to rather prize those beards of ours they were almost our sole distinction among those tall and sturdy women with their cropped hair and sexless costume
being offered a wide selection of garments we had chosen according to our personal taste and were surprised to find on meeting large audiences that we were the most highly decorated especially terry
he was a very impressive figure his strong features softened by the somewhat longer hairthough he made me trim it as closely as i knew how and he wore his richly embroidered tunic with its broad loose girdle with quite a henry v air
jeff looked more likewell like a huguenot lover and i dont know what i looked like only that i felt very comfortable
when i got back to our own padded armor and its starched borders i realized with acute regret how comfortable were those herland clothes
we scanned that audience looking for the three bright faces we knew but they were not to be seen
just a multitude of girls quiet eager watchful all eyes and ears to listen and learn
we had been urged to give as fully as we cared to a sort of synopsis of world history in brief and to answer questions
we are so utterly ignorant you see moadine had explained to us
we know nothing but such science as we have worked out for ourselves just the brain work of one small halfcountry and you we gather have helped one another all over the globe sharing your discoveries pooling your progress
how wonderful how supremely beautiful your civilization must be somel gave a further suggestion
you do not have to begin all over again as you did with us
we have made a sort of digest of what we have learned from you and it has been eagerly absorbed all over the country
perhaps you would like to see our outline we were eager to see it and deeply impressed
to us at first these women unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of knowledge had seemed on the plane of children or of savages
what we had been forced to admit with growing acquaintance was that they were ignorant as plato and aristotle were but with a highly developed mentality quite comparable to that of ancient greece
far be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so imperfectly strove to teach them
the memorable fact is what they taught us or some faint glimpse of it
and at present our major interest was not at all in the subject matter of our talk but in the audience
girlshundreds of themeager brighteyed attentive young faces crowding questions and i regret to say an increasing inability on our part to answer them effectively
our special guides who were on the platform with us and sometimes aided in clarifying a question or oftener an answer noticed this effect and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather shortly
our young women will be glad to meet you somel suggested to talk with you more personally if you are willing willing
we were impatient and said as much at which i saw a flickering little smile cross moadines face
even then with all those eager young things waiting to talk to us a sudden question crossed my mind what was their point of view
what did they think of us we learned that later
terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea
jeff with a rapt look on his highbred face approached as to a sacrament
but i was a little chilled by that last thought of mine and kept my eyes open
i found time to watch jeff even while i was surrounded by an eager group of questionersas we all wereand saw how his worshipping eyes his grave courtesy pleased and drew some of them while others rather stronger spirits they looked to be drew away from his group to terrys or mine
i watched terry with special interest knowing how he had longed for this time and how irresistible he had always been at home
and i could see just in snatches of course how his suave and masterful approach seemed to irritate them his toointimate glances were vaguely resented his compliments puzzled and annoyed
sometimes a girl would flush not with drooped eyelids and inviting timidity but with anger and a quick lift of the head
girl after girl turned on her heel and left him till he had but a small ring of questioners and they visibly were the least girlish of the lot
i saw him looking pleased at first as if he thought he was making a strong impression but finally casting a look at jeff or me he seemed less pleasedand less
as for me i was most agreeably surprised
at home i never was popular i had my girl friends good ones but they were friendsnothing else
also they were of somewhat the same clan not popular in the sense of swarming admirers
but here to my astonishment i found my crowd was the largest
i have to generalize of course rather telescoping many impressions but the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made
jeff had a following if i may call it that of the more sentimentalthough thats not the word i want
the less practical perhaps the girls who were artists of some sort ethicists teachersthat kind
terry was reduced to a rather combative group keen logical inquiring minds not overly sensitive the very kind he liked least while as for mei became quite cocky over my general popularity
terry was furious about it
we could hardly blame him
girls he burst forth when that evening was over and we were by ourselves once more
call those girls most delightful girls i call them said jeff his blue eyes dreamily contented
what do you call them i mildly inquired
boys
nothing but boys most of em
a standoffish disagreeable lot at that
critical impertinent youngsters
no girls at all he was angry and severe not a little jealous too i think
afterward when he found out just what it was they did not like he changed his manner somewhat and got on better
he had to
for in spite of his criticism they were girls and furthermore all the girls there were
always excepting our threewith whom we presently renewed our acquaintance
when it came to courtship which it soon did i can of course best describe my ownand am least inclined to
but of jeff i heard somewhat he was inclined to dwell reverently and admiringly at some length on the exalted sentiment and measureless perfection of his celis and terryterry made so many false starts and met so many rebuffs that by the time he really settled down to win alima he was considerably wiser
at that it was not smooth sailing
they broke and quarreled over and over he would rush off to console himself with some other fair onethe other fair one would have none of himand he would drift back to alima becoming more and more devoted each time
she never gave an inch
a big handsome creature rather exceptionally strong even in that race of strong women with a proud head and sweeping level brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wide wings of a soaring hawk
i was good friends with all three of them but best of all with ellador long before that feeling changed for both of us
from her and from somel who talked very freely with me i learned at last something of the viewpoint of herland toward its visitors
here they were isolated happy contented when the booming buzz of our biplane tore the air above them
everybody heard itsaw itfor miles and miles word flashed all over the country and a council was held in every town and village
and this was their rapid determination from another country
probably men
evidently highly civilized
doubtless possessed of much valuable knowledge
may be dangerous
catch them if possible tame and train them if necessary this may be a chance to reestablish a bisexual state for our people they were not afraid of usthree million highly intelligent womenor two million counting only grownupswere not likely to be afraid of three young men
we thought of them as women and therefore timid but it was two thousand years since they had had anything to be afraid of and certainly more than one thousand since they had outgrown the feeling
we thoughtat least terry didthat we could have our pick of them
they thoughtvery cautiously and farsightedlyof picking us if it seemed wise
all that time we were in training they studied us analyzed us prepared reports about us and this information was widely disseminated all about the land
not a girl in that country had not been learning for months as much as could be gathered about our country our culture our personal characters
no wonder their questions were hard to answer
but i am sorry to say when we were at last brought out andexhibited i hate to call it that but thats what it was there was no rush of takers
here was poor old terry fondly imagining that at last he was free to stray in a rosebud garden of girlsand behold
the rosebuds were all with keen appraising eye studying us
they were interested profoundly interested but it was not the kind of interest we were looking for
to get an idea of their attitude you have to hold in mind their extremely high sense of solidarity
they were not each choosing a lover they hadnt the faintest idea of lovesexlove that is
these girlsto each of whom motherhood was a lodestar and that motherhood exalted above a mere personal function looked forward to as the highest social service as the sacrament of a lifetimewere now confronted with an opportunity to make the great step of changing their whole status of reverting to their earlier bisexual order of nature
beside this underlying consideration there was the limitless interest and curiosity in our civilization purely impersonal and held by an order of mind beside which we were likeschoolboys
it was small wonder that our lectures were not a success and none at all that our or at least terrys advances were so ill received
the reason for my own comparative success was at first far from pleasing to my pride
we like you the best somel told me because you seem more like us more like a lot of women i thought to myself disgustedly and then remembered how little like women in our derogatory sense they were
she was smiling at me reading my thought
we can quite see that we do not seem likewomento you
of course in a bisexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be intensified
but surely there are characteristics enough which belong to people arent there
thats what i mean about you being more like usmore like people
we feel at ease with you jeffs difficulty was his exalted gallantry
he idealized women and was always looking for a chance to protect or to serve them
these needed neither protection nor service
they were living in peace and power and plenty we were their guests their prisoners absolutely dependent
of course we could promise whatsoever we might of advantages if they would come to our country but the more we knew of theirs the less we boasted
terrys jewels and trinkets they prized as curios handed them about asking questions as to workmanship not in the least as to value and discussed not ownership but which museum to put them in
when a man has nothing to give a woman is dependent wholly on his personal attraction his courtship is under limitations
they were considering these two things the advisability of making the great change and the degree of personal adaptability which would best serve that end
here we had the advantage of our small personal experience with those three fleet forest girls and that served to draw us together
as for ellador suppose you come to a strange land and find it pleasant enoughjust a little more than ordinarily pleasantand then you find rich farmland and then gardens gorgeous gardens and then palaces full of rare and curious treasuresincalculable inexhaustible and thenmountainslike the himalayas and then the sea
i liked her that day she balanced on the branch before me and named the trio
i thought of her most
afterward i turned to her like a friend when we met for the third time and continued the acquaintance
while jeffs ultradevotion rather puzzled celis really put off their day of happiness while terry and alima quarreled and parted remet and reparted ellador and i grew to be close friends
we talked and talked
we took long walks together
she showed me things explained them interpreted much that i had not understood
through her sympathetic intelligence i became more and more comprehending of the spirit of the people of herland more and more appreciative of its marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection
i ceased to feel a stranger a prisoner
there was a sense of understanding of identity of purpose
we discussedeverything
and as i traveled farther and farther exploring the rich sweet soul of her my sense of pleasant friendship became but a broad foundation for such height such breadth such interlocked combination of feeling as left me fairly blinded with the wonder of it
as ive said i had never cared very much for women nor they for menot terryfashion
but this one at first i never even thought of her in that way as the girls have it
i had not come to the country with any turkishharem intentions and i was no womanworshipper like jeff
i just liked that girl as a friend as we say
that friendship grew like a tree
she was such a good sport
we did all kinds of things together
she taught me games and i taught her games and we raced and rowed and had all manner of fun as well as higher comradeship
then as i got on farther the palace and treasures and snowy mountain ranges opened up
i had never known there could be such a human being
sogreat
i dont mean talented
she was a foresterone of the bestbut it was not that gift i mean
when i say great i mean greatbig all through
if i had known more of those women as intimately i should not have found her so unique but even among them she was noble
her mother was an over motherand her grandmother too i heard later
so she told me more and more of her beautiful land and i told her as much yes more than i wanted to about mine and we became inseparable
then this deeper recognition came and grew
i felt my own soul rise and lift its wings as it were
life got bigger
it seemed as if i understoodas i never had beforeas if i could do thingsas if i too could growif she would help me
and then it cameto both of us all at once
a still dayon the edge of the world their world
the two of us gazing out over the far dim forestland below talking of heaven and earth and human life and of my land and other lands and what they needed and what i hoped to do for them if you will help me i said
she turned to me with that high sweet look of hers and then as her eyes rested in mine and her hands toothen suddenly there blazed out between us a farther glory instant overwhelmingquite beyond any words of mine to tell
celis was a blueandgoldandrose person alma blackandwhiteandred a blazing beauty
ellador was brown hair dark and soft like a seal coat clear brown skin with a healthy red in it brown eyesall the way from topaz to black velvet they seemed to rangesplendid girls all of them
they had seen us first of all far down in the lake below and flashed the tidings across the land even before our first exploring flight
they had watched our landing flitted through the forest with us hidden in that tree andi shrewdly suspectgiggled on purpose
they had kept watch over our hooded machine taking turns at it and when our escape was announced had followed alongside for a day or two and been there at the last as described
they felt a special claim on uscalled us their menand when we were at liberty to study the land and people and be studied by them their claim was recognized by the wise leaders
but i felt we all did that we should have chosen them among millions unerringly
and yet the path of true love never did run smooth this period of courtship was full of the most unsuspected pitfalls
writing this as late as i do after manifold experiences both in herland and later in my own land i can now understand and philosophize about what was then a continual astonishment and often a temporary tragedy
the long suit in most courtships is sex attraction of course
then gradually develops such comradeship as the two temperaments allow
then after marriage there is either the establishment of a slowgrowing widely based friendship the deepest tenderest sweetest of relations all lit and warmed by the recurrent flame of love or else that process is reversed love cools and fades no friendship grows the whole relation turns from beauty to ashes
here everything was different
there was no sexfeeling to appeal to or practically none
two thousand years disuse had left very little of the instinct also we must remember that those who had at times manifested it as atavistic exceptions were often by that very fact denied motherhood
yet while the mother process remains the inherent ground for sexdistinction remains also and who shall say what longforgotten feeling vague and nameless was stirred in some of these mother hearts by our arrival
what left us even more at sea in our approach was the lack of any sextradition
there was no accepted standard of what was manly and what was womanly when jeff said taking the fruit basket from his adored one a woman should not carry anything celis said why with the frankest amazement
he could not look that fleetfooted deepchested young forester in the face and say because she is weaker she wasnt
one does not call a race horse weak because it is visibly not a cart horse
he said rather lamely that women were not built for heavy work
she looked out across the fields to where some women were working building a new bit of wall out of large stones looked back at the nearest town with its womanbuilt houses down at the smooth hard road we were walking on and then at the little basket he had taken from her
i dont understand she said quite sweetly
are the women in your country so weak that they could not carry such a thing as that it is a convention he said
we assume that motherhood is a sufficient burdenthat men should carry all the others what a beautiful feeling she said her blue eyes shining
does it work asked alima in her keen swift way
do all men in all countries carry everything
or is it only in yours dont be so literal terry begged lazily
why arent you willing to be worshipped and waited on
we like to do it you dont like to have us do it to you she answered
thats different he said annoyed and when she said why is it he quite sulked referring her to me saying vans the philosopher ellador and i talked it all out together so that we had an easier experience of it when the real miracle time came
also between us we made things clearer to jeff and celis
but terry would not listen to reason
he was madly in love with alima
he wanted to take her by storm and nearly lost her forever
you see if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and inexperienced who in the second place is educated with a background of caveman tradition a middleground of poetry and romance and a foreground of unspoken hope and interest all centering upon the one event and who has furthermore absolutely no other hope or interest worthy of the namewhy it is a comparatively easy matter to sweep her off her feet with a dashing attack
terry was a past master in this process
he tried it here and alima was so affronted so repelled that it was weeks before he got near enough to try again
the more coldly she denied him the hotter his determination he was not used to real refusal
the approach of flattery she dismissed with laughter gifts and such attentions we could not bring to bear pathos and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry
it took terry a long time
i doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did celis and ellador theirs
he had hurt and offended her too often there were reservations
but i think alima retained some faint vestige of longdescended feeling which made terry more possible to her than to others and that she had made up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it
however it came about we all three at length achieved full understanding and solemnly faced what was to them a step of measureless importance a grave question as well as a great happiness to us a strange new joy
of marriage as a ceremony they knew nothing
jeff was for bringing them to our country for the religious and the civil ceremony but neither celis nor the others would consent
we cant expect them to want to go with usyet said terry sagely
wait a bit boys
weve got to take em on their own termsif at all this in rueful reminiscence of his repeated failures
but our times coming he added cheerfully
these women have never been mastered you see this as one who had made a discovery
youd better not try to do any mastering if you value your chances i told him seriously but he only laughed and said every man to his trade we couldnt do anything with him
he had to take his own medicine
if the lack of tradition of courtship left us much at sea in our wooing we found ourselves still more bewildered by lack of tradition of matrimony
and here again i have to draw on later experience and as deep an acquaintance with their culture as i could achieve to explain the gulfs of difference between us
two thousand years of one continuous culture with no men
back of that only traditions of the harem
they had no exact analogue for our word home any more than they had for our romanbased family
they loved one another with a practically universal affection rising to exquisite and unbroken friendships and broadening to a devotion to their country and people for which our word patriotism is no definition at all
patriotism red hot is compatible with the existence of a neglect of national interests a dishonesty a cold indifference to the suffering of millions
patriotism is largely pride and very largely combativeness
patriotism generally has a chip on its shoulder
this country had no other country to measure itself bysave the few poor savages far below with whom they had no contact
they loved their country because it was their nursery playground and workshoptheirs and their childrens
they were proud of it as a workshop proud of their record of everincreasing efficiency they had made a pleasant garden of it a very practical little heaven but most of all they valued itand here it is hard for us to understand themas a cultural environment for their children
that of course is the keynote of the whole distinctiontheir children
from those first breathlessly guarded halfadored race mothers all up the ascending line they had this dominant thought of building up a great race through the children
all the surrendering devotion our women have put into their private families these women put into their country and race
all the loyalty and service men expect of wives they gave not singly to men but collectively to one another
and the mother instinct with us so painfully intense so thwarted by conditions so concentrated in personal devotion to a few so bitterly hurt by death disease or barrenness and even by the mere growth of the children leaving the mother alone in her empty nestall this feeling with them flowed out in a strong wide current unbroken through the generations deepening and widening through the years including every child in all the land
with their united power and wisdom they had studied and overcome the diseases of childhoodtheir children had none
they had faced the problems of education and so solved them that their children grew up as naturally as young trees learning through every sense taught continuously but unconsciouslynever knowing they were being educated
in fact they did not use the word as we do
their idea of education was the special training they took when half grown up under experts
then the eager young minds fairly flung themselves on their chosen subjects and acquired with an ease a breadth a grasp at which i never ceased to wonder
but the babies and little children never felt the pressure of that forcible feeding of the mind that we call education of this more later
our relations and theirs what im trying to show here is that with these women the whole relationship of life counted in a glad eager growingup to join the ranks of workers in the line best loved a deep tender reverence for ones own mothertoo deep for them to speak of freelyand beyond that the whole free wide range of sisterhood the splendid service of the country and friendships
to these women we came filled with the ideas convictions traditions of our culture and undertook to rouse in them the emotions whichto usseemed proper
however much or little of true sexfeeling there was between us it phrased itself in their minds in terms of friendship the one purely personal love they knew and of ultimate parentage
visibly we were not mothers nor children nor compatriots so if they loved us we must be friends
that we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to them that we three should remain much together as they did themselves was also natural
we had as yet no work so we hung about them in their forest tasks that was natural too
but when we began to talk about each couple having homes of our own they could not understand it
our work takes us all around the country explained celis
we cannot live in one place all the time we are together now urged alima looking proudly at terrys stalwart nearness
this was one of the times when they were on though presently off again
its not the same thing at all he insisted
a man wants a home of his own with his wife and family in it staying in it
all the time asked ellador
not imprisoned surely of course not
living therenaturally he answered
what does she do thereall the time alima demanded
what is her work then terry patiently explained again that our women did not workwith reservations
but what do they doif they have no work she persisted
they take care of the homeand the children at the same time asked ellador
why yes
the children play about and the mother has charge of it all
there are servants of course it seemed so obvious so natural to terry that he always grew impatient but the girls were honestly anxious to understand
how many children do your women have alima had her notebook out now and a rather firm set of lip
terry began to dodge
there is no set number my dear he explained
some have more some have less some have none at all i put in mischievously
they pounced on this admission and soon wrung from us the general fact that those women who had the most children had the least servants and those who had the most servants had the least children
there triumphed alima
one or two or no children and three or four servants
now what do those women do we explained as best we might
we talked of social duties disingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did we talked of hospitality entertainment and various interests all the time we knew that to these largeminded women whose whole mental outlook was so collective the limitations of a wholly personal life were inconceivable
we cannot really understand it ellador concluded
we are only half a people
we have our womanways and they have their manways and their bothways
we have worked out a system of living which is of course limited
they must have a broader richer better one
i should like to see it you shall dearest i whispered
theres nothing to smoke complained terry
he was in the midst of a prolonged quarrel with alima and needed a sedative
theres nothing to drink
these blessed women have no pleasant vices
i wish we could get out of here this wish was vain
we were always under a certain degree of watchfulness
when terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he always found a colonel here or there and when on an occasion of fierce though temporary despair he had plunged to the cliff edge with some vague view to escape he found several of them close by
we were freebut there was a string to it
theyve no unpleasant ones either jeff reminded him
wish they had terry persisted
theyve neither the vices of men nor the virtues of womentheyre neuters you know better than that
dont talk nonsense said i severely
i was thinking of elladors eyes when they gave me a certain look a look she did not at all realize
jeff was equally incensed
i dont know what virtues of women you miss
seems to me they have all of them theyve no modesty snapped terry
no patience no submissiveness none of that natural yielding which is womans greatest charm i shook my head pityingly
go and apologize and make friends again terry
youve got a grouch thats all
these women have the virtue of humanity with less of its faults than any folks i ever saw
as for patiencetheyd have pitched us over the cliffs the first day we lit among em if they hadnt that there are nodistractions he grumbled
nowhere a man can go and cut loose a bit
its an everlasting parlor and nursery and workshop i added
and school and office and laboratory and studio and theater andhome home he sneered
there isnt a home in the whole pitiful place there isnt anything else and you know it jeff retorted hotly
i never saw i never dreamed of such universal peace and good will and mutual affection oh well of course if you like a perpetual sunday school its all very well
but i like something doing
here its all done there was something to this criticism
the years of pioneering lay far behind them
theirs was a civilization in which the initial difficulties had long since been overcome
the untroubled peace the unmeasured plenty the steady health the large good will and smooth management which ordered everything left nothing to overcome
it was like a pleasant family in an old established perfectly run country place
i liked it because of my eager and continued interest in the sociological achievements involved
jeff liked it as he would have liked such a family and such a place anywhere
terry did not like it because he found nothing to oppose to struggle with to conquer
life is a struggle has to be he insisted
if there is no struggle there is no lifethats all youre talking nonsensemasculine nonsense the peaceful jeff replied
he was certainly a warm defender of herland
ants dont raise their myriads by a struggle do they
or the bees oh if you go back to insectsand want to live in an anthill
i tell you the higher grades of life are reached only through strugglecombat
theres no drama here
look at their plays
they make me sick he rather had us there
the drama of the country wasto our tasterather flat
you see they lacked the sex motive and with it jealousy
they had no interplay of warring nations no aristocracy and its ambitions no wealth and poverty opposition
i see i have said little about the economics of the place it should have come before but ill go on about the drama now
they had their own kind
there was a most impressive array of pageantry of processions a sort of grand ritual with their arts and their religion broadly blended
the very babies joined in it
to see one of their great annual festivals with the massed and marching stateliness of those great mothers the young women brave and noble beautiful and strong and then the children taking part as naturally as ours would frolic round a christmas treeit was overpowering in the impression of joyous triumphant life
they had begun at a period when the drama the dance music religion and education were all very close together and instead of developing them in detached lines they had kept the connection
let me try again to give if i can a faint sense of the difference in the life viewthe background and basis on which their culture rested
ellador told me a lot about it
she took me to see the children the growing girls the special teachers
she picked out books for me to read
she always seemed to understand just what i wanted to know and how to give it to me
while terry and alima struck sparks and partedhe always madly drawn to her and she to himshe must have been or shed never have stood the way he behavedellador and i had already a deep restful feeling as if wed always had one another
jeff and celis were happy there was no question of that but it didnt seem to me as if they had the good times we did
well here is the herland child facing lifeas ellador tried to show it to me
from the first memory they knew peace beauty order safety love wisdom justice patience and plenty
by plenty i mean that the babies grew up in an environment which met their needs just as young fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brookfed meadows
and they enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would
they found themselves in a big bright lovely world full of the most interesting and enchanting things to learn about and to do
the people everywhere were friendly and polite
no herland child ever met the overbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children
they were people too from the first the most precious part of the nation
in each step of the rich experience of living they found the instance they were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of common interests
the things they learned were related from the first related to one another and to the national prosperity
it was a butterfly that made me a forester said ellador
i was about eleven years old and i found a big purpleandgreen butterfly on a low flower
i caught it very carefully by the closed wings as i had been told to do and carried it to the nearest insect teacheri made a note there to ask her what on earth an insect teacher wasto ask her its name
she took it from me with a little cry of delight
oh you blessed child she said
do you like obernuts of course i liked obernuts and said so
it is our best foodnut you know
this is a female of the obernut moth she told me
they are almost gone
we have been trying to exterminate them for centuries
if you had not caught this one it might have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands of our nut treesthousands of bushels of nutsand make years and years of trouble for us everybody congratulated me
the children all over the country were told to watch for that moth if there were any more
i was shown the history of the creature and an account of the damage it used to do and of how long and hard our foremothers had worked to save that tree for us
i grew a foot it seemed to me and determined then and there to be a forester this is but an instance she showed me many
the big difference was that whereas our children grow up in private homes and families with every effort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world here they grew up in a wide friendly world and knew it for theirs from the first
their childliterature was a wonderful thing
i could have spent years following the delicate subtleties the smooth simplicities with which they had bent that great art to the service of the child mind
we have two life cycles the mans and the womans
to the man there is growth struggle conquest the establishment of his family and as much further success in gain or ambition as he can achieve
to the woman growth the securing of a husband the subordinate activities of family life and afterward such social or charitable interests as her position allows
here was but one cycle and that a large one
the child entered upon a broad open field of life in which motherhood was the one great personal contribution to the national life and all the rest the individual share in their common activities
every girl i talked to at any age above babyhood had her cheerful determination as to what she was going to be when she grew up
what terry meant by saying they had no modesty was that this great lifeview had no shady places they had a high sense of personal decorum but no shameno knowledge of anything to be ashamed of
even their shortcomings and misdeeds in childhood never were presented to them as sins merely as errors and misplaysas in a game
some of them who were palpably less agreeable than others or who had a real weakness or fault were treated with cheerful allowance as a friendly group at whist would treat a poor player
their religion you see was maternal and their ethics based on the full perception of evolution showed the principle of growth and the beauty of wise culture
they had no theory of the essential opposition of good and evil life to them was growth their pleasure was in growing and their duty also
with this background with their sublimated motherlove expressed in terms of widest social activity every phase of their work was modified by its effect on the national growth
the language itself they had deliberately clarified simplified made easy and beautiful for the sake of the children
this seemed to us a wholly incredible thing first that any nation should have the foresight the strength and the persistence to plan and fulfill such a task and second that women should have had so much initiative
we have assumed as a matter of course that women had none that only the man with his natural energy and impatience of restriction would ever invent anything
here we found that the pressure of life upon the environment develops in the human mind its inventive reactions regardless of sex and further that a fully awakened motherhood plans and works without limit for the good of the child
that the children might be most nobly born and reared in an environment calculated to allow the richest freest growth they had deliberately remodeled and improved the whole state
i do not mean in the least that they stopped at that any more than a child stops at childhood
the most impressive part of their whole culture beyond this perfect system of childrearing was the range of interests and associations open to them all for life
but in the field of literature i was most struck at first by the childmotive
they had the same gradation of simple repetitive verse and story that we are familiar with and the most exquisite imaginative tales but where with us these are the dribbled remnants of ancient folk myths and primitive lullabies theirs were the exquisite work of great artists not only simple and unfailing in appeal to the childmind but true true to the living world about them
to sit in one of their nurseries for a day was to change ones views forever as to babyhood
the youngest ones rosy fatlings in their mothers arms or sleeping lightly in the flowersweet air seemed natural enough save that they never cried
i never heard a child cry in herland save once or twice at a bad fall and then people ran to help as we would at a scream of agony from a grown person
each mother had her year of glory the time to love and learn living closely with her child nursing it proudly often for two years or more
this perhaps was one reason for their wonderful vigor
but after the babyyear the mother was not so constantly in attendance unless indeed her work was among the little ones
she was never far off however and her attitude toward the comothers whose proud childservice was direct and continuous was lovely to see
as for the babiesa group of those naked darlings playing on short velvet grass cleanswept or rugs as soft or in shallow pools of bright water tumbling over with bubbling joyous baby laughterit was a view of infant happiness such as i had never dreamed
the babies were reared in the warmer part of the country and gradually acclimated to the cooler heights as they grew older
sturdy children of ten and twelve played in the snow as joyfully as ours do there were continuous excursions of them from one part of the land to another so that to each child the whole country might be home
it was all theirs waiting for them to learn to love to use to serve as our own little boys plan to be a big soldier or a cowboy or whatever pleases their fancy and our little girls plan for the kind of home they mean to have or how many children these planned freely and gaily with much happy chattering of what they would do for the country when they were grown
it was the eager happiness of the children and young people which first made me see the folly of that common notion of oursthat if life was smooth and happy people would not enjoy it
as i studied these youngsters vigorous joyous eager little creatures and their voracious appetite for life it shook my previous ideas so thoroughly that they have never been reestablished
the steady level of good health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call animal spiritsan odd contradiction in terms
they found themselves in an immediate environment which was agreeable and interesting and before them stretched the years of learning and discovery the fascinating endless process of education
as i looked into these methods and compared them with our own my strange uncomfortable sense of racehumility grew apace
ellador could not understand my astonishment
she explained things kindly and sweetly but with some amazement that they needed explaining and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than ever
i betook myself to somel one day carefully not taking ellador
i did not mind seeming foolish to somelshe was used to it
i want a chapter of explanation i told her
you know my stupidities by heart and i do not want to show them to elladorshe thinks me so wise she smiled delightedly
it is beautiful to see she told me this new wonderful love between you
the whole country is interested you knowhow can we help it i had not thought of that
we say all the world loves a lover but to have a couple of million people watching ones courtshipand that a difficult onewas rather embarrassing
tell me about your theory of education i said
make it short and easy
and to show you what puzzles me ill tell you that in our theory great stress is laid on the forced exertion of the childs mind we think it is good for him to overcome obstacles of course it is she unexpectedly agreed
all our children do thatthey love to that puzzled me again
if they loved to do it how could it be educational
our theory is this she went on carefully
here is a young human being
the mind is as natural a thing as the body a thing that grows a thing to use and enjoy
we seek to nourish to stimulate to exercise the mind of a child as we do the body
there are the two main divisions in educationyou have those of coursethe things it is necessary to know and the things it is necessary to do to do
mental exercises you mean yes
our general plan is this in the matter of feeding the mind of furnishing information we use our best powers to meet the natural appetite of a healthy young brain not to overfeed it to provide such amount and variety of impressions as seem most welcome to each child
that is the easiest part
the other division is in arranging a properly graduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind the common faculties we all have and most carefully the especial faculties some of us have
you do this also do you not in a way i said rather lamely
we have not so subtle and highly developed a system as you not approaching it but tell me more
as to the informationhow do you manage
it appears that all of you know pretty much everythingis that right this she laughingly disclaimed
by no means
we are as you soon found out extremely limited in knowledge
i wish you could realize what a ferment the country is in over the new things you have told us the passionate eagerness among thousands of us to go to your country and learnlearnlearn
but what we do know is readily divisible into common knowledge and special knowledge
the common knowledge we have long since learned to feed into the minds of our little ones with no waste of time or strength the special knowledge is open to all as they desire it
some of us specialize in one line only
but most take up severalsome for their regular work some to grow with to grow with yes
when one settles too close in one kind of work there is a tendency to atrophy in the disused portions of the brain
we like to keep on learning always what do you study as much as we know of the different sciences
we have within our limits a good deal of knowledge of anatomy physiology nutritionall that pertains to a full and beautiful personal life
we have our botany and chemistry and so onvery rudimentary but interesting our own history with its accumulating psychology you put psychology with historynot with personal life of course
it is ours it is among and between us and it changes with the succeeding and improving generations
we are at work slowly and carefully developing our whole people along these lines
it is glorious worksplendid
to see the thousands of babies improving showing stronger clearer minds sweeter dispositions higher capacitiesdont you find it so in your country this i evaded flatly
i remembered the cheerless claim that the human mind was no better than in its earliest period of savagery only better informeda statement i had never believed
we try most earnestly for two powers somel continued
the two that seem to us basically necessary for all noble life a clear farreaching judgment and a strong wellused will
we spend our best efforts all through childhood and youth in developing these faculties individual judgment and will as part of your system of education you mean exactly
as the most valuable part
with the babies as you may have noticed we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without tiring it all manner of simple and interesting things to do as soon as they are old enough to do them physical properties of course come first
but as early as possible going very carefully not to tax the mind we provide choices simple choices with very obvious causes and consequences
youve noticed the games i had
the children seemed always playing something or else sometimes engaged in peaceful researches of their own
i had wondered at first when they went to school but soon found that they never didto their knowledge
it was all education but no schooling
we have been working for some sixteen hundred years devising better and better games for children continued somel
i sat aghast
devising games i protested
making up new ones you mean exactly she answered
dont you then i remembered the kindergarten and the material devised by signora montessori and guardedly replied to some extent but most of our games i told her were very oldcame down from child to child along the ages from the remote past
and what is their effect she asked
do they develop the faculties you wish to encourage again i remembered the claims made by the advocates of sports and again replied guardedly that that was in part the theory
but do the children like it i asked
having things made up and set before them that way
dont they want the old games you can see the children she answered
are yours more contentedmore interestedhappier then i thought as in truth i never had thought before of the dull bored children i had seen whining what can i do now of the little groups and gangs hanging about of the value of some one strong spirit who possessed initiative and would start something of the childrens parties and the onerous duties of the older people set to amuse the children also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call mischief the foolish destructive sometimes evil things done by unoccupied children
no said i grimly
i dont think they are the herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared full of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn but into the society of plentiful numbers of teachers teachers born and trained whose business it was to accompany the children along that to us impossible thingthe royal road to learning
there was no mystery in their methods
being adapted to children it was at least comprehensible to adults
i spent many days with the little ones sometimes with ellador sometimes without and began to feel a crushing pity for my own childhood and for all others that i had known
the houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to hurtno stairs no corners no small loose objects to swallow no firejust a babies paradise
they were taught as rapidly as feasible to use and control their own bodies and never did i see such surefooted steadyhanded clearheaded little things
it was a joy to watch a row of toddlers learning to walk not only on a level floor but a little later on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two above the soft turf or heavy rugs and falling off with shrieks of infant joy to rush back to the end of the line and try again
surely we have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it
but we have never thought to provide that simple and inexhaustible form of amusement and physical education for the young
water they had of course and could swim even before they walked
if i feared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture that fear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical merriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their first years
they never knew they were being educated
they did not dream that in this association of hilarious experiment and achievement they were laying the foundation for that close beautiful group feeling into which they grew so firmly with the years
this was education for citizenship
their religions and our marriages it took me a long time as a man a foreigner and a species of christiani was that as much as anythingto get any clear understanding of the religion of herland
its deification of motherhood was obvious enough but there was far more to it than that or at least than my first interpretation of that
i think it was only as i grew to love ellador more than i believed anyone could love anybody as i grew faintly to appreciate her inner attitude and state of mind that i began to get some glimpses of this faith of theirs
when i asked her about it she tried at first to tell me and then seeing me flounder asked for more information about ours
she soon found that we had many that they varied widely but had some points in common
a clear methodical luminous mind had my ellador not only reasonable but swiftly perceptive
she made a sort of chart superimposing the different religions as i described them with a pin run through them all as it were their common basis being a dominant power or powers and some special behavior mostly taboos to please or placate
there were some common features in certain groups of religions but the one always present was this power and the things which must be done or not done because of it
it was not hard to trace our human imagery of the divine force up through successive stages of bloodthirsty sensual proud and cruel gods of early times to the conception of a common father with its corollary of a common brotherhood
this pleased her very much and when i expatiated on the omniscience omnipotence omnipresence and so on of our god and of the loving kindness taught by his son she was much impressed
the story of the virgin birth naturally did not astonish her but she was greatly puzzled by the sacrifice and still more by the devil and the theory of damnation
when in an inadvertent moment i said that certain sects had believed in infant damnationand explained itshe sat very still indeed
they believed that god was loveand wisdomand power yesall of that her eyes grew large her face ghastly pale
and yet that such a god could put little new babies to burnfor eternity she fell into a sudden shuddering and left me running swiftly to the nearest temple
every smallest village had its temple and in those gracious retreats sat wise and noble women quietly busy at some work of their own until they were wanted always ready to give comfort light or help to any applicant
ellador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged and seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it
you see we are not accustomed to horrible ideas she said coming back to me rather apologetically
we havent any
and when we get a thing like that into our minds its likeoh like red pepper in your eyes
so i just ran to her blinded and almost screaming and she took it out so quicklyso easily how i asked very curious
why you blessed child she said youve got the wrong idea altogether
you do not have to think that there ever was such a godfor there wasnt
or such a happeningfor there wasnt
nor even that this hideous false idea was believed by anybody
but only thisthat people who are utterly ignorant will believe anythingwhich you certainly knew before anyhow pursued ellador she turned pale for a minute when i first said it this was a lesson to me
no wonder this whole nation of women was peaceful and sweet in expressionthey had no horrible ideas
surely you had some when you began i suggested
oh yes no doubt
but as soon as our religion grew to any height at all we left them out of course from this as from many other things i grew to see what i finally put in words
have you no respect for the past
for what was thought and believed by your foremothers why no she said
why should we
they are all gone
they knew less than we do
if we are not beyond them we are unworthy of themand unworthy of the children who must go beyond us this set me thinking in good earnest
i had always imaginedsimply from hearing it said i supposethat women were by nature conservative
yet these women quite unassisted by any masculine spirit of enterprise had ignored their past and built daringly for the future
ellador watched me think
she seemed to know pretty much what was going on in my mind
its because we began in a new way i suppose
all our folks were swept away at once and then after that time of despair came those wonder childrenthe first
and then the whole breathless hope of us was for their childrenif they should have them
and they did
then there was the period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous and after that when it all came down to one child apiece we began to really workto make better ones but how does this account for such a radical difference in your religion i persisted
she said she couldnt talk about the difference very intelligently not being familiar with other religions but that theirs seemed simple enough
their great mother spirit was to them what their own motherhood wasonly magnified beyond human limits
that meant that they felt beneath and behind them an upholding unfailing serviceable loveperhaps it was really the accumulated motherlove of the race they feltbut it was a power
just what is your theory of worship i asked her
worship
what is that i found it singularly difficult to explain
this divine love which they felt so strongly did not seem to ask anything of themany more than our mothers do she said
but surely your mothers expect honor reverence obedience from you
you have to do things for your mothers surely oh no she insisted smiling shaking her soft brown hair
we do things from our mothersnot for them
we dont have to do things for themthey dont need it you know
but we have to live onsplendidlybecause of them and thats the way we feel about god i meditated again
i thought of that god of battles of ours that jealous god that vengeanceismine god
i thought of our worldnightmarehell
you have no theory of eternal punishment then i take it ellador laughed
her eyes were as bright as stars and there were tears in them too
she was so sorry for me
how could we she asked fairly enough
we have no punishments in life you see so we dont imagine them after death have you no punishments
neither for children nor criminalssuch mild criminals as you have i urged
do you punish a person for a broken leg or a fever
we have preventive measures and cures sometimes we have to send the patient to bed as it were but thats not a punishmentits only part of the treatment she explained
then studying my point of view more closely she added you see we recognize in our human motherhood a great tender limitless uplifting forcepatience and wisdom and all subtlety of delicate method
we credit godour idea of godwith all that and more
our mothers are not angry with uswhy should god be does god mean a person to you this she thought over a little
whyin trying to get close to it in our minds we personify the idea naturally but we certainly do not assume a big woman somewhere who is god
what we call god is a pervading power you know an indwelling spirit something inside of us that we want more of
is your god a big man she asked innocently
whyyes to most of us i think
of course we call it an indwelling spirit just as you do but we insist that it is him a person and a manwith whiskers whiskers
oh yesbecause you have them
or do you wear them because he does on the contrary we shave them offbecause it seems cleaner and more comfortable does he wear clothesin your idea i mean i was thinking over the pictures of god i had seenrash advances of the devout mind of man representing his omnipotent deity as an old man in a flowing robe flowing hair flowing beard and in the light of her perfectly frank and innocent questions this concept seemed rather unsatisfying
i explained that the god of the christian world was really the ancient hebrew god and that we had simply taken over the patriarchal ideathat ancient one which quite inevitably clothed its thought of god with the attributes of the patriarchal ruler the grandfather
i see she said eagerly after i had explained the genesis and development of our religious ideals
they lived in separate groups with a male head and he was probably a littledomineering no doubt of that i agreed
and we live together without any head in that sensejust our chosen leadersthat does make a difference your difference is deeper than that i assured her
it is in your common motherhood
your children grow up in a world where everybody loves them
they find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused love and wisdom of all mothers
so it is easy for you to think of god in the terms of a similar diffused and competent love
i think you are far nearer right than we are what i cannot understand she pursued carefully is your preservation of such a very ancient state of mind
this patriarchal idea you tell me is thousands of years old oh yesfour five six thousandevery so many and you have made wonderful progress in those yearsin other things we certainly have
but religion is different
you see our religions come from behind us and are initiated by some great teacher who is dead
he is supposed to have known the whole thing and taught it finally
all we have to do is believeand obey who was the great hebrew teacher ohthere it was different
the hebrew religion is an accumulation of extremely ancient traditions some far older than their people and grew by accretion down the ages
we consider it inspiredthe word of god how do you know it is because it says so does it say so in as many words
who wrote that in i began to try to recall some text that did say so and could not bring it to mind
apart from that she pursued what i cannot understand is why you keep these early religious ideas so long
you have changed all your others havent you pretty generally i agreed
but this we call revealed religion and think it is final
but tell me more about these little temples of yours i urged
and these temple mothers you run to then she gave me an extended lesson in applied religion which i will endeavor to concentrate
they developed their central theory of a loving power and assumed that its relation to them was motherlythat it desired their welfare and especially their development
their relation to it similarly was filial a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high purposes
then being nothing if not practical they set their keen and active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them
this worked out in a most admirable system of ethics
the principle of love was universally recognizedand used
patience gentleness courtesy all that we call good breeding was part of their code of conduct
but where they went far beyond us was in the special application of religious feeling to every field of life
they had no ritual no little set of performances called divine service save those religious pageants i have spoken of and those were as much educational as religious and as much social as either
but they had a clear established connection between everything they didand god
their cleanliness their health their exquisite order the rich peaceful beauty of the whole land the happiness of the children and above all the constant progress they madeall this was their religion
they applied their minds to the thought of god and worked out the theory that such an inner power demanded outward expression
they lived as if god was real and at work within them
as for those little temples everywheresome of the women were more skilled more temperamentally inclined in this direction than others
these whatever their work might be gave certain hours to the temple service which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and trained thought to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it
sometimes it was a real grief very rarely a quarrel most often a perplexity even in herland the human soul had its hours of darkness
but all through the country their best and wisest were ready to give help
if the difficulty was unusually profound the applicant was directed to someone more specially experienced in that line of thought
here was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis in life the concept of an immense loving power working steadily out through them toward good
it gave to the soul that sense of contact with the inmost force of perception of the uttermost purpose which we always crave
it gave to the heart the blessed feeling of being loved loved and understood
it gave clear simple rational directions as to how we should liveand why
and for ritual it gave first those triumphant group demonstrations when with a union of all the arts the revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with march and dance song and music among their own noblest products and the open beauty of their groves and hills
second it gave these numerous little centers of wisdom where the least wise could go to the most wise and be helped
it is beautiful i cried enthusiastically
it is the most practical comforting progressive religion i ever heard of
you do love one anotheryou do bear one anothers burdensyou do realize that a little child is a type of the kingdom of heaven
you are more christian than any people i ever saw
buthow about death
and the life everlasting
what does your religion teach about eternity nothing said ellador
what is eternity what indeed
i tried for the first time in my life to get a real hold on the idea
it isnever stopping never stopping she looked puzzled
yes life going on forever ohwe see that of course
life does go on forever all about us but eternal life goes on without dying the same person yes the same person unending immortal i was pleased to think that i had something to teach from our religion which theirs had never promulgated
here asked ellador
never to diehere i could see her practical mind heaping up the people and hurriedly reassured her
oh no indeed not herehereafter
we must die here of course but then we enter into eternal life the soul lives forever how do you know she inquired
i wont attempt to prove it to you i hastily continued
let us assume it to be so
how does this idea strike you again she smiled at me that adorable dimpling tender mischievous motherly smile of hers
shall i be quite quite honest you couldnt be anything else i said half gladly and half a little sorry
the transparent honesty of these women was a neverending astonishment to me
it seems to me a singularly foolish idea she said calmly
and if true most disagreeable now i had always accepted the doctrine of personal immortality as a thing established
the efforts of inquiring spiritualists always seeking to woo their beloved ghosts back again never seemed to me necessary
i dont say i had ever seriously and courageously discussed the subject with myself even i had simply assumed it to be a fact
and here was the girl i loved this creature whose character constantly revealed new heights and ranges far beyond my own this superwoman of a superland saying she thought immortality foolish
she meant it too
what do you want it for she asked
how can you not want it i protested
do you want to go out like a candle
dont you want to go on and ongrowing andandbeing happy forever why no she said
i dont in the least
i want my childand my childs childto go onand they will
why should i want to but it means heaven i insisted
peace and beauty and comfort and lovewith god i had never been so eloquent on the subject of religion
she could be horrified at damnation and question the justice of salvation but immortalitythat was surely a noble faith
why van she said holding out her hands to me
why vandarling
how splendid of you to feel it so keenly
thats what we all want of coursepeace and beauty and comfort and lovewith god
and progress too remember growth always and always
that is what our religion teaches us to want and to work for and we do but that is here i said only for this life on earth well
and do not you in your country with your beautiful religion of love and service have it here toofor this lifeon earth none of us were willing to tell the women of herland about the evils of our own beloved land
it was all very well for us to assume them to be necessary and essential and to criticizestrictly among ourselvestheir alltooperfect civilization but when it came to telling them about the failures and wastes of our own we never could bring ourselves to do it
moreover we sought to avoid too much discussion and to press the subject of our approaching marriages
jeff was the determined one on this score
of course they havent any marriage ceremony or service but we can make it a sort of quaker wedding and have it in the templeit is the least we can do for them it was
there was so little after all that we could do for them
here we were penniless guests and strangers with no chance even to use our strength and couragenothing to defend them from or protect them against
we can at least give them our names jeff insisted
they were very sweet about it quite willing to do whatever we asked to please us
as to the names alima frank soul that she was asked what good it would do
terry always irritating her said it was a sign of possession
you are going to be mrs nicholson he said
mrs
t o nicholson
that shows everyone that you are my wife what is a wife exactly she demanded a dangerous gleam in her eye
a wife is the woman who belongs to a man he began
but jeff took it up eagerly and a husband is the man who belongs to a woman
it is because we are monogamous you know
and marriage is the ceremony civil and religious that joins the two togetheruntil death do us part he finished looking at celis with unutterable devotion
what makes us all feel foolish i told the girls is that here we have nothing to give youexcept of course our names do your women have no names before they are married celis suddenly demanded
why yes jeff explained
they have their maiden namestheir fathers names that is and what becomes of them asked alima
they change them for their husbands my dear terry answered her
change them
do the husbands then take the wives maiden names oh no he laughed
the man keeps his own and gives it to her too then she just loses hers and takes a new onehow unpleasant
we wont do that alima said decidedly
terry was goodhumored about it
i dont care what you do or dont do so long as we have that wedding pretty soon he said reaching a strong brown hand after alimas quite as brown and nearly as strong
as to giving us thingsof course we can see that youd like to but we are glad you cant celis continued
you see we love you just for yourselveswe wouldnt want you toto pay anything
isnt it enough to know that you are loved personallyand just as men enough or not that was the way we were married
we had a great triple wedding in the biggest temple of all and it looked as if most of the nation was present
it was very solemn and very beautiful
someone had written a new song for the occasion nobly beautiful about the new hope for their peoplethe new tie with other landsbrotherhood as well as sisterhood and with evident awe fatherhood
terry was always restive under their talk of fatherhood
anybodyd think we were high priests ofof philoprogenitiveness he protested
these women think of nothing but children seems to me
well teach em he was so certain of what he was going to teach and alima so uncertain in her moods of reception that jeff and i feared the worst
we tried to caution himmuch good that did
the big handsome fellow drew himself up to his full height lifted that great chest of his and laughed
there are three separate marriages he said
i wont interfere with yoursnor you with mine so the great day came and the countless crowds of women and we three bridegrooms without any supporting best men or any other men to back us up felt strangely small as we came forward
somel and zava and moadine were on hand we were thankful to have them toothey seemed almost like relatives
there was a splendid procession wreathing dances the new anthem i spoke of and the whole great place pulsed with feelingthe deep awe the sweet hope the wondering expectation of a new miracle
there has been nothing like this in the country since our motherhood began somel said softly to me while we watched the symbolic marches
you see it is the dawn of a new era
you dont know how much you mean to us
it is not only fatherhoodthat marvelous dual parentage to which we are strangersthe miracle of union in lifegivingbut it is brotherhood
you are the rest of the world
you join us to our kindto all the strange lands and peoples we have never seen
we hope to know themto love and help themand to learn of them
ah
you cannot know thousands of voices rose in the soaring climax of that great hymn of the coming life
by the great altar of motherhood with its crown of fruit and flowers stood a new one crowned as well
before the great over mother of the land and her ring of high temple counsellors before that vast multitude of calmfaced mothers and holyeyed maidens came forward our own three chosen ones and we three men alone in all that land joined hands with them and made our marriage vows
our difficulties we say marriage is a lottery also marriages are made in heavenbut this is not so widely accepted as the other
we have a wellfounded theory that it is best to marry in ones class and certain wellgrounded suspicions of international marriages which seem to persist in the interests of social progress rather than in those of the contracting parties
but no combination of alien races of color of caste or creed was ever so basically difficult to establish as that between us three modern american men and these three women of herland
it is all very well to say that we should have been frank about it beforehand
we had been frank
we had discussedat least ellador and i hadthe conditions of the great adventure and thought the path was clear before us
but there are some things one takes for granted supposes are mutually understood and to which both parties may repeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing
the differences in the education of the average man and woman are great enough but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man he generally carries out his own views of the case
the woman may have imagined the conditions of married life to be different but what she imagined was ignorant of or might have preferred did not seriously matter
i can see clearly and speak calmly about this now writing after a lapse of years years full of growth and education but at the time it was rather hard sledding for all of usespecially for terry
poor terry
you see in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the earth whether the woman were black red yellow brown or white whether she were ignorant or educated submissive or rebellious she would have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history
this tradition relates the woman to the man
he goes on with his business and she adapts herself to him and to it
even in citizenship by some strange hocuspocus that fact of birth and geography was waved aside and the woman automatically acquired the nationality of her husband
wellhere were we three aliens in this land of women
it was small in area and the external differences were not so great as to astound us
we did not yet appreciate the differences between the racemind of this people and ours
in the first place they were a pure stock of two thousand uninterrupted years
where we have some long connected lines of thought and feeling together with a wide range of differences often irreconcilable these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of the basic principles of their life and not only agreed in principle but accustomed for these sixtyodd generations to act on those principles
this is one thing which we did not understandhad made no allowance for
when in our premarital discussions one of those dear girls had said we understand it thus and thus or we hold such and such to be true we men in our own deepseated convictions of the power of love and our easy views about beliefs and principles fondly imagined that we could convince them otherwise
what we imagined before marriage did not matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines
we found the facts to be different
it was not that they did not love us they did deeply and warmly
but there are you againwhat they meant by love and what we meant by love were so different
perhaps it seems rather coldblooded to say we and they as if we were not separate couples with our separate joys and sorrows but our positions as aliens drove us together constantly
the whole strange experience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would ever have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people
also as men with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand years we were a unit small but firm against this far larger unit of feminine tradition
i think i can make clear the points of difference without a too painful explicitness
the more external disagreement was in the matter of the home and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we by instinct and long education supposed to be inherently appropriate to women
i will give two illustrations one away up and the other away down to show how completely disappointed we were in this regard
for the lower one try to imagine a male ant coming from some state of existence where ants live in pairs endeavoring to set up housekeeping with a female ant from a highly developed anthill
this female ant might regard him with intense personal affection but her ideas of parentage and economic management would be on a very different scale from his
now of course if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants he might have had his way with her but if he was a stray male in an anthill
for the higher one try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying to set up housekeeping with a lady angel a real wingsandharpandhalo angel accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar space
this angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his power of return or even of appreciation but her ideas of service and duty would be on a very different scale from his
of course if she was a stray angel in a country of men he might have had his way with her but if he was a stray man among angels
terry at his worst in a black fury for which as a man i must have some sympathy preferred the ant simile
more of terry and his special troubles later
it was hard on terry
jeffwell jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world
hes the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier times
he accepted the angel theory swallowed it whole tried to force it on uswith varying effect
he so worshipped celis and not only celis but what she represented he had become so deeply convinced of the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people that he took his medicine like ai cannot say like a man but more as if he wasnt one
dont misunderstand me for a moment
dear old jeff was no milksop or mollycoddle either
he was a strong brave efficient man and an excellent fighter when fighting was necessary
but there was always this angel streak in him
it was rather a wonder terry being so different that he really loved jeff as he did but it happens so sometimes in spite of the differenceperhaps because of it
as for me i stood between
i was no such gay lothario as terry and no such galahad as jeff
but for all my limitations i think i had the habit of using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than either of them
i had to use brainpower now i can tell you
the big point at issue between us and our wives was as may easily be imagined in the very nature of the relation
wives
dont talk to me about wives stormed terry
they dont know what the word means which is exactly the factthey didnt
how could they
back in their prehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of wifehood as we know it and since then no possibility of forming such
the only thing they can think of about a man is fatherhood said terry in high scorn
fatherhood as if a man was always wanting to be a father this also was correct
they had their long wide deep rich experience of motherhood and their only perception of the value of a male creature as such was for fatherhood
aside from that of course was the whole range of personal love love which as jeff earnestly phrased it passeth the love of women it did too
i can give no ideaeither now after long and happy experience of it or as it seemed then in the first measureless wonderof the beauty and power of the love they gave us
even alimawho had a more stormy temperament than either of the others and who heaven knows had far more provocationeven alima was patience and tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved until hebut i havent got to that yet
these as terry put it alleged or socalled wives of ours went right on with their profession as foresters
we having no special learnings had long since qualified as assistants
we had to do something if only to pass the time and it had to be workwe couldnt be playing forever
this kept us out of doors with those dear girls and more or less togethertoo much together sometimes
these people had it now became clear to us the highest keenest most delicate sense of personal privacy but not the faintest idea of that solitude deux we are so fond of
they had every one of them the two rooms and a bath theory realized
from earliest childhood each had a separate bedroom with toilet conveniences and one of the marks of coming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive friends
long since we had been given our own two rooms apiece and as being of a different sex and race these were in a separate house
it seemed to be recognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in real seclusion
for food we either went to any convenient eatinghouse ordered a meal brought in or took it with us to the woods always and equally good
all this we had become used to and enjoyedin our courting days
after marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling that called for a separate house but this feeling found no response in the hearts of those fair ladies
we are alone dear ellador explained to me with gentle patience
we are alone in these great forests we may go and eat in any little summerhousejust we two or have a separate table anywhereor even have a separate meal in our own rooms
how could we be aloner this was all very true
we had our pleasant mutual solitude about our work and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours we had as it were all the pleasures of courtship carried right on but we had no sense ofperhaps it may be called possession
might as well not be married at all growled terry
they only got up that ceremony to please usplease jeff mostly
theyve no real idea of being married i tried my best to get elladors point of view and naturally i tried to give her mine
of course what we as men wanted to make them see was that there were other and as we proudly said higher uses in this relation than what terry called mere parentage in the highest terms i knew i tried to explain this to ellador
anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life as we did she said
how is it higher it develops love i explained
all the power of beautiful permanent mated love comes through this higher development are you sure she asked gently
how do you know that it was so developed
there are some birds who love each other so that they mope and pine if separated and never pair again if one dies but they never mate except in the mating season
among your people do you find high and lasting affection appearing in proportion to this indulgence it is a very awkward thing sometimes to have a logical mind
of course i knew about those monogamous birds and beasts too that mate for life and show every sign of mutual affection without ever having stretched the sex relationship beyond its original range
but what of it
those are lower forms of life i protested
they have no capacity for faithful and affectionate and apparently happybut oh my dear
my dearwhat can they know of such a love as draws us together
why to touch youto be near youto come closer and closerto lose myself in yousurely you feel it too do you not i came nearer
i seized her hands
her eyes were on mine tender radiant but steady and strong
there was something so powerful so large and changeless in those eyes that i could not sweep her off her feet by my own emotion as i had unconsciously assumed would be the case
it made me feel as one might imagine a man might feel who loved a goddessnot a venus though
she did not resent my attitude did not repel it did not in the least fear it evidently
there was not a shade of that timid withdrawal or pretty resistance which are soprovocative
you see dearest she said you have to be patient with us
we are not like the women of your country
we are mothers and we are people but we have not specialized in this line we and we and weit was so hard to get her to be personal
and as i thought that i suddenly remembered how we were always criticizing our women for being so personal
then i did my earnest best to picture to her the sweet intense joy of married lovers and the result in higher stimulus to all creative work
do you mean she asked quite calmly as if i was not holding her cool firm hands in my hot and rather quivering ones that with you when people marry they go right on doing this in season and out of season with no thought of children at all they do i said with some bitterness
they are not mere parents
they are men and women and they love each other how long asked ellador rather unexpectedly
how long i repeated a little dashed
why as long as they live there is something very beautiful in the idea she admitted still as if she were discussing life on mars
this climactic expression which in all the other lifeforms has but the one purpose has with you become specialized to higher purer nobler uses
it hasi judge from what you tell methe most ennobling effect on character
people marry not only for parentage but for this exquisite interchangeand as a result you have a world full of continuous lovers ardent happy mutually devoted always living on that high tide of supreme emotion which we had supposed to belong only to one season and one use
and you say it has other results stimulating all high creative work
that must mean floods oceans of such work blossoming from this intense happiness of every married pair
it is a beautiful idea she was silent thinking
so was i
she slipped one hand free and was stroking my hair with it in a gentle motherly way
i bowed my hot head on her shoulder and felt a dim sense of peace a restfulness which was very pleasant
you must take me there someday darling she was saying
it is not only that i love you so much i want to see your countryyour peopleyour mother she paused reverently
oh how i shall love your mother i had not been in love many timesmy experience did not compare with terrys
but such as i had was so different from this that i was perplexed and full of mixed feelings partly a growing sense of common ground between us a pleasant rested calm feeling which i had imagined could only be attained in one way and partly a bewildered resentment because what i found was not what i had looked for
it was their confounded psychology
here they were with this profound highly developed system of education so bred into them that even if they were not teachers by profession they all had a general proficiency in itit was second nature to them
and no child stormily demanding a cookie between meals was ever more subtly diverted into an interest in housebuilding than was i when i found an apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my noticing it
and all the time those tender mother eyes those keen scientific eyes noting every condition and circumstance and learning how to take time by the forelock and avoid discussion before occasion arose
i was amazed at the results
i found that much very much of what i had honestly supposed to be a physiological necessity was a psychological necessityor so believed
i found after my ideas of what was essential had changed that my feelings changed also
and more than all i found thisa factor of enormous weightthese women were not provocative
that made an immense difference
the thing that terry had so complained of when we first camethat they werent feminine they lacked charm now became a great comfort
their vigorous beauty was an aesthetic pleasure not an irritant
their dress and ornaments had not a touch of the comeandfindme element
even with my own ellador my wife who had for a time unveiled a womans heart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage she afterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at first
they were women plus and so much plus that when they did not choose to let the womanness appear you could not find it anywhere
i dont say it was easy for me it wasnt
but when i made appeal to her sympathies i came up against another immovable wall
she was sorry honestly sorry for my distresses and made all manner of thoughtful suggestions often quite useful as well as the wise foresight i have mentioned above which often saved all difficulty before it arose but her sympathy did not alter her convictions
if i thought it was really right and necessary i could perhaps bring myself to it for your sake dear but i do not want tonot at all
you would not have a mere submission would you
that is not the kind of high romantic love you spoke of surely
it is a pity of course that you should have to adjust your highly specialized faculties to our unspecialized ones confound it
i hadnt married the nation and i told her so
but she only smiled at her own limitations and explained that she had to think in wes confound it again
here id have all my energies focused on one wish and before i knew it shed have them dissipated in one direction or another some subject of discussion that began just at the point i was talking about and ended miles away
it must not be imagined that i was just repelled ignored left to cherish a grievance
not at all
my happiness was in the hands of a larger sweeter womanhood than i had ever imagined
before our marriage my own ardor had perhaps blinded me to much of this
i was madly in love with not so much what was there as with what i supposed to be there
now i found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore and in it the sweetest wisdom and understanding
it was as if i had come to some new place and people with a desire to eat at all hours and no other interests in particular and as if my hosts instead of merely saying you shall not eat had presently aroused in me a lively desire for music for pictures for games for exercise for playing in the water for running some ingenious machine and in the multitude of my satisfactions i forgot the one point which was not satisfied and got along very well until mealtime
one of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear to me many years after when we were so wholly at one on this subject that i could laugh at my own predicament then
it was this you see with us women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as possible
we men have our own world with only men in it we get tired of our ultramaleness and turn gladly to the ultrafemaleness
also in keeping our women as feminine as possible we see to it that when we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence
well the atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive
the very numbers of these human women always in human relation made them anything but alluring
when in spite of this my hereditary instincts and racetraditions made me long for the feminine response in ellador instead of withdrawing so that i should want her more she deliberately gave me a little too much of her societyalways defeminized as it were
it was awfully funny really
here was i with an ideal in mind for which i hotly longed and here was she deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a facta fact which i coolly enjoyed but which actually interfered with what i wanted
i see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man like sir almroth wright resents the professional development of women
it gets in the way of the sex ideal it temporarily covers and excludes femininity
of course in this case i was so fond of ellador my friend of ellador my professional companion that i necessarily enjoyed her society on any terms
onlywhen i had had her with me in her defeminine capacity for a sixteenhour day i could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming about her
the witch
if ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul she did great superwoman that she was
i couldnt then half comprehend the skill of it the wonder
but this i soon began to find that under all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women there is an older deeper more natural feeling the restful reverence which looks up to the mother sex
so we grew together in friendship and happiness ellador and i and so did jeff and celis
when it comes to terrys part of it and alimas im sorryand im ashamed
of course i blame her somewhat
she wasnt as fine a psychologist as ellador and whats more i think she had a fardescended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness never apparent till terry called it out
but when all is said it doesnt excuse him
i hadnt realized to the full terrys characteri couldnt being a man
the position was the same as with us of course only with these distinctions
alima a shade more alluring and several shades less able as a practical psychologist terry a hundredfold more demandingand proportionately less reasonable
things grew strained very soon between them
i fancy at first when they were together in her great hope of parentage and his keen joy of conquestthat terry was inconsiderate
in fact i know it from things he said
you neednt talk to me he snapped at jeff one day just before our weddings
there never was a woman yet that did not enjoy being mastered
all your pretty talk doesnt amount to a hill obeansi know and terry would hum ive taken my fun where i found it
ive rogued and ive ranged in my time and the things that i learned from the yellow and black they ave helped me a eap with the white
jeff turned sharply and left him at the time
i was a bit disquieted myself
poor old terry
the things hed learned didnt help him a heap in herland
his idea was to takehe thought that was the way
he thought he honestly believed that women like it
not the women of herland
not alima
i can see her nowone day in the very first week of their marriage setting forth to her days work with long determined strides and hardset mouth and sticking close to ellador
she didnt wish to be alone with terryyou could see that
but the more she kept away from him the more he wanted hernaturally
he made a tremendous row about their separate establishments tried to keep her in his rooms tried to stay in hers
but there she drew the line sharply
he came away one night and stamped up and down the moonlit road swearing under his breath
i was taking a walk that night too but i wasnt in his state of mind
to hear him rage youd not have believed that he loved alima at allyoud have thought that she was some quarry he was pursuing something to catch and conquer
i think that owing to all those differences i spoke of they soon lost the common ground they had at first and were unable to meet sanely and dispassionately
i fancy toothis is pure conjecturethat he had succeeded in driving alima beyond her best judgment her real conscience and that after that her own sense of shame the reaction of the thing made her bitter perhaps
they quarreled really quarreled and after making it up once or twice they seemed to come to a real breakshe would not be alone with him at all
and perhaps she was a bit nervous i dont know but she got moadine to come and stay next door to her
also she had a sturdy assistant detailed to accompany her in her work
terry had his own ideas as ive tried to show
i daresay he thought he had a right to do as he did
perhaps he even convinced himself that it would be better for her
anyhow he hid himself in her bedroom one night
the women of herland have no fear of men
why should they have
they are not timid in any sense
they are not weak and they all have strong trained athletic bodies
othello could not have extinguished alima with a pillow as if she were a mouse
terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be mastered and by sheer brute force in all the pride and passion of his intense masculinity he tried to master this woman
it did not work
i got a pretty clear account of it later from ellador but what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle and alima calling to moadine
moadine was close by and came at once one or two more strong grave women followed
terry dashed about like a madman he would cheerfully have killed themhe told me that himselfbut he couldnt
when he swung a chair over his head one sprang in the air and caught it two threw themselves bodily upon him and forced him to the floor it was only the work of a few moments to have him tied hand and foot and then in sheer pity for his futile rage to anesthetize him
alima was in a cold fury
she wanted him killedactually
there was a trial before the local over mother and this woman who did not enjoy being mastered stated her case
in a court in our country he would have been held quite within his rights of course
but this was not our country it was theirs
they seemed to measure the enormity of the offense by its effect upon a possible fatherhood and he scorned even to reply to this way of putting it
he did let himself go once and explained in definite terms that they were incapable of understanding a mans needs a mans desires a mans point of view
he called them neuters epicenes bloodless sexless creatures
he said they could of course kill himas so many insects couldbut that he despised them nonetheless
and all those stern grave mothers did not seem to mind his despising them not in the least
it was a long trial and many interesting points were brought out as to their views of our habits and after a while terry had his sentence
he waited grim and defiant
the sentence was you must go home expelled we had all meant to go home again
indeed we had not meantnot by any meansto stay as long as we had
but when it came to being turned out dismissed sent away for bad conduct we none of us really liked it
terry said he did
he professed great scorn of the penalty and the trial as well as all the other characteristics of this miserable halfcountry but he knew and we knew that in any whole country we should never have been as forgivingly treated as we had been here
if the people had come after us according to the directions we left thered have been quite a different story said terry
we found out later why no reserve party had arrived
all our careful directions had been destroyed in a fire
we might have all died there and no one at home have ever known our whereabouts
terry was under guard now all the time known as unsafe convicted of what was to them an unpardonable sin
he laughed at their chill horror
parcel of old maids he called them
theyre all old maidschildren or not
they dont know the first thing about sex when terry said sex sex with a very large s he meant the male sex naturally its special values its profound conviction of being the life force its cheerful ignoring of the true life process and its interpretation of the other sex solely from its own point of view
i had learned to see these things very differently since living with ellador and as for jeff he was so thoroughly herlandized that he wasnt fair to terry who fretted sharply in his new restraint
moadine grave and strong as sadly patient as a mother with a degenerate child kept steady watch on him with enough other women close at hand to prevent an outbreak
he had no weapons and well knew that all his strength was of small avail against those grim quiet women
we were allowed to visit him freely but he had only his room and a small highwalled garden to walk in while the preparations for our departure were under way
three of us were to go terry because he must i because two were safer for our flyer and the long boat trip to the coast ellador because she would not let me go without her
if jeff had elected to return celis would have gone toothey were the most absorbed of lovers but jeff had no desire that way
why should i want to go back to all our noise and dirt our vice and crime our disease and degeneracy he demanded of me privately
we never spoke like that before the women
i wouldnt take celis there for anything on earth he protested
shed die
shed die of horror and shame to see our slums and hospitals
how can you risk it with ellador
youd better break it to her gently before she really makes up her mind jeff was right
i ought to have told her more fully than i did of all the things we had to be ashamed of
but it is very hard to bridge the gulf of as deep a difference as existed between our life and theirs
i tried to
look here my dear i said to her
if you are really going to my country with me youve got to be prepared for a good many shocks
its not as beautiful as thisthe cities i mean the civilized partsof course the wild country is i shall enjoy it all she said her eyes starry with hope
i understand its not like ours
i can see how monotonous our quiet life must seem to you how much more stirring yours must be
it must be like the biological change you told me about when the second sex was introduceda far greater movement constant change with new possibilities of growth i had told her of the later biological theories of sex and she was deeply convinced of the superior advantages of having two the superiority of a world with men in it
we have done what we could alone perhaps we have some things better in a quiet way but you have the whole worldall the people of the different nationsall the long rich history behind youall the wonderful new knowledge
oh i just cant wait to see it what could i do
i told her in so many words that we had our unsolved problems that we had dishonesty and corruption vice and crime disease and insanity prisons and hospitals and it made no more impression on her than it would to tell a south sea islander about the temperature of the arctic circle
she could intellectually see that it was bad to have those things but she could not feel it
we had quite easily come to accept the herland life as normal because it was normalnone of us make any outcry over mere health and peace and happy industry
and the abnormal to which we are all so sadly well acclimated she had never seen
the two things she cared most to hear about and wanted most to see were these the beautiful relation of marriage and the lovely women who were mothers and nothing else beyond these her keen active mind hungered eagerly for the world life
im almost as anxious to go as you are yourself she insisted and you must be desperately homesick i assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as theirs but she would have none of it
oh yesi know
its like those little tropical islands youve told me about shining like jewels in the big blue seai cant wait to see the sea
the little island may be as perfect as a garden but you always want to get back to your own big country dont you
even if it is bad in some ways ellador was more than willing
but the nearer it came to our really going and to my having to take her back to our civilization after the clean peace and beauty of theirs the more i began to dread it and the more i tried to explain
of course i had been homesick at first while we were prisoners before i had ellador
and of course i had at first rather idealized my country and its ways in describing it
also i had always accepted certain evils as integral parts of our civilization and never dwelt on them at all
even when i tried to tell her the worst i never remembered some thingswhich when she came to see them impressed her at once as they had never impressed me
now in my efforts at explanation i began to see both ways more keenly than i had before to see the painful defects of my own land the marvelous gains of this
in missing men we three visitors had naturally missed the larger part of life and had unconsciously assumed that they must miss it too
it took me a long time to realizeterry never did realizehow little it meant to them
when we say men man manly manhood and all the other masculine derivatives we have in the background of our minds a huge vague crowded picture of the world and all its activities
to grow up and be a man to act like a manthe meaning and connotation is wide indeed
that vast background is full of marching columns of men of changing lines of men of long processions of men of men steering their ships into new seas exploring unknown mountains breaking horses herding cattle ploughing and sowing and reaping toiling at the forge and furnace digging in the mine building roads and bridges and high cathedrals managing great businesses teaching in all the colleges preaching in all the churches of men everywhere doing everythingthe world and when we say women we think femalethe sex
but to these women in the unbroken sweep of this twothousandyearold feminine civilization the word woman called up all that big background so far as they had gone in social development and the word man meant to them only malethe sex
of course we could tell them that in our world men did everything but that did not alter the background of their minds
that man the male did all these things was to them a statement making no more change in the point of view than was made in ours when we first faced the astounding factto usthat in herland women were the world we had been living there more than a year
we had learned their limited history with its straight smooth upreaching lines reaching higher and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life
we had learned a little of their psychology a much wider field than the history but here we could not follow so readily
we were now well used to seeing women not as females but as people people of all sorts doing every kind of work
this outbreak of terrys and the strong reaction against it gave us a new light on their genuine femininity
this was given me with great clearness by both ellador and somel
the feeling was the samesick revulsion and horror such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy
they had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds knowing nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us
to them the one high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of life and the contribution of the father though known to them so distinctly another method to the same end that they could not with all their effort get the point of view of the male creature whose desires quite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term the joys of love when i tried to tell ellador that women too felt so with us she drew away from me and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in no way sympathize with
you meanthat with youlove between man and woman expresses itself in that waywithout regard to motherhood
to parentage i mean she added carefully
yes surely
it is love we think ofthe deep sweet love between two
of course we want children and children comebut that is not what we think about butbutit seems so against nature she said
none of the creatures we know do that
do other animalsin your country we are not animals i replied with some sharpness
at least we are something moresomething higher
this is a far nobler and more beautiful relation as i have explained before
your view seems to us rathershall i say practical
prosaic
merely a means to an end
with usoh my dear girlcannot you see
cannot you feel
it is the last sweetest highest consummation of mutual love she was impressed visibly
she trembled in my arms as i held her close kissing her hungrily
but there rose in her eyes that look i knew so well that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though i held her beautiful body so close and was now on some snowy mountain regarding me from a distance
i feel it quite clearly she said to me
it gives me a deep sympathy with what you feel no doubt more strongly still
but what i feel even what you feel dearest does not convince me that it is right
until i am sure of that of course i cannot do as you wish ellador at times like this always reminded me of epictetus
i will put you in prison said his master
my body you mean replied epictetus calmly
i will cut your head off said his master
have i said that my head could not be cut off a difficult person epictetus
what is this miracle by which a woman even in your arms may withdraw herself utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the face of a cliff
be patient with me dear she urged sweetly
i know it is hard for you
and i begin to seea littlehow terry was so driven to crime oh come thats a pretty hard word for it
after all alima was his wife you know i urged feeling at the moment a sudden burst of sympathy for poor terry
for a man of his temperamentand habitsit must have been an unbearable situation
but ellador for all her wide intellectual grasp and the broad sympathy in which their religion trained them could not make allowance for suchto hersacrilegious brutality
it was the more difficult to explain to her because we three in our constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world had naturally avoided the seamy side not so much from a desire to deceive but from wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization in the face of the beauty and comfort of theirs
also we really thought some things were right or at least unavoidable which we could readily see would be repugnant to them and therefore did not discuss
again there was much of our worlds life which we being used to it had not noticed as anything worth describing
and still further there was about these women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had made no impression whatever
i am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong was the impression made upon ellador when she at last entered our civilization
she urged me to be patient and i was patient
you see i loved her so much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much happiness
we were lovers and there is surely delight enough in that
do not imagine that these young women utterly refused the great new hope as they called it that of dual parentage
for that they had agreed to marry us though the marrying part of it was a concession to our prejudices rather than theirs
to them the process was the holy thingand they meant to keep it holy
but so far only celis her blue eyes swimming in happy tears her heart lifted with that tide of racemotherhood which was their supreme passion could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to be a mother
the new motherhood they called it and the whole country knew
there was no pleasure no service no honor in all the land that celis might not have had
almost like the breathless reverence with which two thousand years ago that dwindling band of women had watched the miracle of virgin birth was the deep awe and warm expectancy with which they greeted this new miracle of union
all mothers in that land were holy
to them for long ages the approach to motherhood has been by the most intense and exquisite love and longing by the supreme desire the overmastering demand for a child
every thought they held in connection with the processes of maternity was open to the day simple yet sacred
every woman of them placed motherhood not only higher than other duties but so far higher that there were no other duties one might almost say
all their wide mutual love all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service the urge of progressive thought and invention the deepest religious emotion every feeling and every act was related to this great central power to the river of life pouring through them which made them the bearers of the very spirit of god
of all this i learned more and morefrom their books from talk especially from ellador
she was at first for a brief moment envious of her frienda thought she put away from her at once and forever
it is better she said to me
it is much better that it has not come to me yetto us that is
for if i am to go with you to your country we may have adventures by sea and land as you say and as in truth we did and it might not be at all safe for a baby
so we wont try again dear till it is safewill we this was a hard saying for a very loving husband
unless she went on if one is coming you will leave me behind
you can come back you knowand i shall have the child then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny touched my heart
id rather have you ellador than all the children in the world
id rather have you with meon your own termsthan not to have you this was a very stupid saying
of course i would
for if she wasnt there i should want all of her and have none of her
but if she went along as a sort of sublimated sisteronly much closer and warmer than that reallywhy i should have all of her but that one thing
and i was beginning to find that elladors friendship elladors comradeship elladors sisterly affection elladors perfectly sincere lovenone the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reservewere enough to live on very happily
i find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me
we talk fine things about women but in our hearts we know that they are very limited beingsmost of them
we honor them for their functional powers even while we dishonor them by our use of it we honor them for their carefully enforced virtue even while we show by our own conduct how little we think of that virtue we value them sincerely for the perverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable of servants bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own decision their whole business outside of the temporary duties of such motherhood as they may achieve to meet our needs in every way
oh we value them all right in their place which place is the home where they perform that mixture of duties so ably described by mrs josephine dodge daskam bacon in which the services of a mistress are carefully specified
she is a very clear writer mrs j d d bacon and understands her subjectfrom her own point of view
butthat combination of industries while convenient and in a way economical does not arouse the kind of emotion commanded by the women of herland
these were women one had to love up very high up instead of down
they were not pets
they were not servants
they were not timid inexperienced weak
after i got over the jar to my pride which jeff i truly think never felthe was a born worshipper and which terry never got overhe was quite clear in his ideas of the position of women i found that loving up was a very good sensation after all
it gave me a queer feeling way down deep as of the stirring of some ancient dim prehistoric consciousness a feeling that they were right somehowthat this was the way to feel
it was likecoming home to mother
i dont mean the underflannelsanddoughnuts mother the fussy person that waits on you and spoils you and doesnt really know you
i mean the feeling that a very little child would have who had been lostfor ever so long
it was a sense of getting home of being clean and rested of safety and yet freedom of love that was always there warm like sunshine in may not hot like a stove or a featherbeda love that didnt irritate and didnt smother
i looked at ellador as if i hadnt seen her before
if you wont go i said ill get terry to the coast and come back alone
you can let me down a rope
and if you will gowhy you blessed wonderwomani would rather live with you all my lifelike thisthan to have any other woman i ever saw or any number of them to do as i like with
will you come she was keen for coming
so the plans went on
shed have liked to wait for that marvel of celiss but terry had no such desire
he was crazy to be out of it all
it made him sick he said sick this everlasting mothermothermothering
i dont think terry had what the phrenologists call the lump of philoprogenitiveness at all well developed
morbid onesided cripples he called them even when from his window he could see their splendid vigor and beauty even while moadine as patient and friendly as if she had never helped alima to hold and bind him sat there in the room the picture of wisdom and serene strength
sexless epicene undeveloped neuters he went on bitterly
he sounded like sir almwroth wright
wellit was hard
he was madly in love with alima really more so than he had ever been before and their tempestuous courtship quarrels and reconciliations had fanned the flame
and then when he sought by that supreme conquest which seems so natural a thing to that type of man to force her to love him as her masterto have the sturdy athletic furious woman rise up and master himshe and her friendsit was no wonder he raged
come to think of it i do not recall a similar case in all history or fiction
women have killed themselves rather than submit to outrage they have killed the outrager they have escaped or they have submittedsometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor afterward
there was that adventure of false sextus for instance who found lucrese combing the fleece under the midnight lamp he threatened as i remember that if she did not submit he would slay her slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there
a poor device it always seemed to me
if mr lucretius had asked him how he came to be in his wifes bedroom overlooking her morals what could he have said
but the point is lucrese submitted and alima didnt
she kicked me confided the embittered prisonerhe had to talk to someone
i was doubled up with the pain of course and she jumped on me and yelled for this old harpy moadine couldnt hear him and they had me trussed up in no time
i believe alima could have done it alone he added with reluctant admiration
shes as strong as a horse
and of course a mans helpless when you hit him like that
no woman with a shade of decency i had to grin at that and even terry did sourly
he wasnt given to reasoning but it did strike him that an assault like his rather waived considerations of decency
id give a year of my life to have her alone again he said slowly his hands clenched till the knuckles were white
but he never did
she left our end of the country entirely went up into the firforest on the highest slopes and stayed there
before we left he quite desperately longed to see her but she would not come and he could not go
they watched him like lynxes
do lynxes watch any better than mousing cats i wonder
wellwe had to get the flyer in order and be sure there was enough fuel left though terry said we could glide all right down to that lake once we got started
wed have gone gladly in a weeks time of course but there was a great todo all over the country about elladors leaving them
she had interviews with some of the leading ethicistswise women with still eyes and with the best of the teachers
there was a stir a thrill a deep excitement everywhere
our teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense of isolation of remoteness of being a little outlying sample of a country overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations
we had called it the family of nations and they liked the phrase immensely
they were deeply aroused on the subject of evolution indeed the whole field of natural science drew them irresistibly
any number of them would have risked everything to go to the strange unknown lands and study but we could take only one and it had to be ellador naturally
we planned greatly about coming back about establishing a connecting route by water about penetrating those vast forests and civilizingor exterminatingthe dangerous savages
that is we men talked of that lastnot with the women
they had a definite aversion to killing things
but meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them all
the students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all this time collating and relating them and making inferences laid the result of their labors before the council
little had we thought that our careful efforts at concealment had been so easily seen through with never a word to show us that they saw
they had followed up words of ours on the science of optics asked innocent questions about glasses and the like and were aware of the defective eyesight so common among us
with the lightest touch different women asking different questions at different times and putting all our answers together like a picture puzzle they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the prevalence of disease among us
even more subtly with no show of horror or condemnation they had gathered somethingfar from the truth but something pretty clearabout poverty vice and crime
they even had a goodly number of our dangers all itemized from asking us about insurance and innocent things like that
they were well posted as to the different races beginning with their poisonarrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial divisions we had told them about
never a shocked expression of the face or exclamation of revolt had warned us they had been extracting the evidence without our knowing it all this time and now were studying with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared
the result was rather distressing to us
they first explained the matter fully to ellador as she was the one who purposed visiting the rest of the world
to celis they said nothing
she must not be in any way distressed while the whole nation waited on her great work
finally jeff and i were called in
somel and zava were there and ellador with many others that we knew
they had a great globe quite fairly mapped out from the small section maps in that compendium of ours
they had the different peoples of the earth roughly outlined and their status in civilization indicated
they had charts and figures and estimates based on the facts in that traitorous little book and what they had learned from us
somel explained we find that in all your historic period so much longer than ours that with all the interplay of services the exchange of inventions and discoveries and the wonderful progress we so admire that in this widespread other world of yours there is still much disease often contagious we admitted this at once
also there is still in varying degree ignorance with prejudice and unbridled emotion this too was admitted
we find also that in spite of the advance of democracy and the increase of wealth that there is still unrest and sometimes combat yes yes we admitted it all
we were used to these things and saw no reason for so much seriousness
all things considered they said and they did not say a hundredth part of the things they were considering we are unwilling to expose our country to free communication with the rest of the worldas yet
if ellador comes back and we approve her report it may be done laterbut not yet
so we have this to ask of you gentlemen they knew that word was held a title of honor with us that you promise not in any way to betray the location of this country until permissionafter elladors return jeff was perfectly satisfied
he thought they were quite right
he always did
i never saw an alien become naturalized more quickly than that man in herland
i studied it awhile thinking of the time theyd have if some of our contagions got loose there and concluded they were right
so i agreed
terry was the obstacle
indeed i wont he protested
the first thing ill do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into maland then they said quite calmly he must remain an absolute prisoner always anesthesia would be kinder urged moadine
and safer added zava
he will promise i think said ellador
and he did
with which agreement we at last left herland
