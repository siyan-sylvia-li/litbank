during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher
i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit
i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasureable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible
i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil
there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime
what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher
it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered
i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth
it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows
nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks
its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting
a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply
the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation
the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady
it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons
although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend
his reserve had been always excessive and habitual
i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science
i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonoured as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain
it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion
i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression
there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself
such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis
and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me
i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the grey wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapour dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued
shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building
its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity
the discoloration of ages had been great
minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves
yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation
no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones
in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air
beyond  this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability
perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn
noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house
a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall
a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master
much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken
while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up
on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family
his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity
he accosted me with trepidation and passed on
the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master
the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty
the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within
feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling
dark draperies hung upon the walls
the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered
many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene
i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow
an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all
upon my entrance usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world
a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity
we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe
surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher
it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood
yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable
a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finelymoulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten
and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke
the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me
the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity
in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation
for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament
his action was alternately vivacious and sullen
his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement
it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him
he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady
it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off
it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations
some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight
he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odours of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror
to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave
i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly
thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost
i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results
i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul
i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror
in this unnervedin this pitiable conditioni feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear
i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition
he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence
he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and only relative on earth
her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers
while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared
i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings
a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps
when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brotherbut he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears
the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians
a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis
hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more
for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend
we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar
and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom
i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher
yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way
an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all
his long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears
among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber
from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vagueness at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words
by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention
if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher
for me at leastin the circumstances then surrounding methere arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli
one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words
a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device
certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth
no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour
i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments
it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of the performances
but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for
they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement
the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered
i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne
the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus                               i
in the greenest of our valleys                  by good angels tenanted                once a fair and stately palace                  radiant palacereared its head
in the monarch thought's dominion                  it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion                  over fabric half so fair
ii
banners yellow glorious golden                  on its roof did float and flow                thisall thiswas in the olden                  time long ago                and every gentle air that dallied                  in that sweet day                along the ramparts plumed and pallid                  a winged odour went away
iii
wanderers in that happy valley                  through two luminous windows saw                spirits moving musically                  to a lute's well tuned law                round about a throne where sitting                  porphyrogene
in state his glory well befitting                  the ruler of the realm was seen
iv
and all with pearl and ruby glowing                  was the fair palace door                through which came flowing flowing flowing                  and sparkling evermore                a troop of echoes whose sweet duty                  was but to sing                in voices of surpassing beauty                  the wit and wisdom of their king
v                 but evil things in robes of sorrow                  assailed the monarch's high estate                ah let us mourn for never morrow                  shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory                  that blushed and bloomed                is but a dimremembered story                  of the old time entombed
vi
and travellers now within that valley                  through the redlitten windows see                vast forms that move fantastically                  to a discordant melody                while like a rapid ghastly river                  through the pale door                a hideous throng rush out forever                  and laughbut smile no more
i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher's which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it
this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things
but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization
i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion
the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers
the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn
its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls
the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was
such opinions need no comment and i will make none
our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm
we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean d'indagine and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun by campanella
one favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorum by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and oegipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours
his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae
i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building
the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute
the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family
i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution
at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment
the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest
the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment
it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper
the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected
its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges
having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant
a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them
our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed
the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death
we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house
and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend
his ordinary manner had vanished
his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten
he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step
the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out
the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance
there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage
at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound
it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me
i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions
it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings
sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away
i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me
i endeavoured to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed
but my efforts were fruitless
an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm
shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence
overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment
i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention
i presently recognized it as that of usher
in an instant afterwards he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp
his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour
his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief
and you have not seen it
he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay
you shall
thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm
the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet
it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty
a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance
i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or starsnor was there any flashing forth of the lightning
but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion
you must notyou shall not behold this
said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat
these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn
let us close this casementthe air is chilling and dangerous to your frame
here is one of your favourite romances
i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together
the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favourite of usher's more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend
it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read
could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design
i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force
here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus  and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the forest
at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described
it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me
i continued the story  but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten       who entereth herein a conquerer hath bin      who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win  and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard
here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer
oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion
i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanour
from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly
his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile
the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway
having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded  and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound
no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation
completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed
i rushed to the chair in which he sat
his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity
but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence
bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words
not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it
longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak
we have put her living in the tomb
said i not that my senses were acute
i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin
i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak
and nowtonightethelredha
hathe breaking of the hermit's door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangour of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault
oh whither shall i fly
will she not be here anon
is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste
have i not heard her footsteps on the stair
do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart
madman
here he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman
i tell you that she now stands without the door
as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spellthe huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws
it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher
there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame
for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated
from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast
the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway
suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me
the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base
while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher
the red death had long devastated the country
no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous
blood was its avatar and its sealthe redness and the horror of blood
there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution
the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen
and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour
but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious
when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys
this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste
a strong and lofty wall girdled it in
this wall had gates of iron
the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts
they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within
the abbey was amply provisioned
with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion
the external world could take care of itself
in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think
the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure
there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine
all these and security were within
without was the red death
it was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence
it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade
but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held
these were sevenan imperial suite
in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded
here the case was very different as might have been expected from the duke's love of the bizarre
the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time
there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect
to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite
these windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened
that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue were its windows
the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple
the third was green throughout and so were the casements
the fourth was furnished and lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethe sixth with violet
the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue
but in this chamber only the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations
the panes here were scarleta deep blood colour
now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof
there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers
but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room
and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances
but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all
it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony
its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to harken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation
but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before
but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel
the tastes of the duke were peculiar
he had a fine eye for colours and effects
he disregarded the decora of mere fashion
his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre
there are some who would have thought him mad
his followers felt that he was not
it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not
he had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fte and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders
be sure they were grotesque
there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani
there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments
there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions
there were much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust
to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams
and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps
and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet
and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock
the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand
but the echoes of the chime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart
and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods
but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcoloured panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments
but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life
and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock
and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before
but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled
and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before
and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror and of disgust
in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation
in truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum
there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion
even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made
the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed
the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave
the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat
and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around
but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death
his vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror
when the eyes of the prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its  role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage
who dareshe demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery
seize him and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements
it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words
they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand
it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of  pale courtiers by his side
at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker
but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the prince's person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him
it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all
he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer
there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death the prince prospero
then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form
and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death
he had come like a thief in the night
and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall
and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay
and the flames of the tripods expired
and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all
