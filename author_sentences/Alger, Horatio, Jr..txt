chapter i
the missing heir
uncle you are not looking well tonight
i'm not well florence
i sometimes doubt if i shall ever be any better
surely uncle you cannot mean yes my child i have reason to believe that i am nearing the end
i cannot bear to hear you speak so uncle said florence linden in irrepressible agitation
you are not an old man
you are but fiftyfour
true florence but it is not years only that make a man old
two great sorrows have embittered my life
first the death of my dearly beloved wife and next the loss of my boy harvey
it is long since i have heard you refer to my cousin's loss
i thought you had become reconciledno i do not mean thati thought your regret might be less poignant
i have not permitted myself to speak of it but i have never ceased to think of it day and night
john linden paused sadly then resumed if he had died i might as you say have become reconciled but he was abducted at the age of four by a revengeful servant whom i had discharged from my employment
heaven knows whether he is living or dead but it is impressed upon my mind that he still lives it may be in misery it may be as a criminal while i his unhappy father live on in luxury which i cannot enjoy with no one to care for me florence linden sank impulsively on her knees beside her uncle's chair
don't say that uncle she pleaded
you know that i love you uncle john
and i too uncle
there was a shade of jealousy in the voice of curtis waring as he entered the library through the open door and approaching his uncle pressed his hand
he was a tall darkcomplexioned man of perhaps thirtyfive with shifty black eyes and thin lips shaded by a dark mustache
it was not a face to trust
even when he smiled the expression of his face did not soften
yet he could moderate his voice so as to express tenderness and sympathy
he was the son of an elder sister of mr linden while florence was the daughter of a younger brother
both were orphans and both formed a part of mr linden's household and owed everything to his bounty
curtis was supposed to be in some business downtown but he received a liberal allowance from his uncle and often drew upon him for outside assistance
as he stood with his uncle's hand in his he was necessarily brought near florence who instinctively drew a little away with a slight shudder indicating repugnance
slight as it was curtis detected it and his face darkened
john linden looked from one to the other
yes he said i must not forget that i have a nephew and a niece
you are both dear to me but no one can take the place of the boy i have lost
but it is so long ago uncle said curtis
it must be fourteen years
it is fourteen years
and the boy is long since dead
no no
said john linden vehemently
i do not i will not believe it
he still lives and i live only in the hope of one day clasping him in my arms
that is very improbable uncle said curtis in a tone of annoyance
there isn't one chance in a hundred that my cousin still lives
the grave has closed over him long since
the sooner you make up your mind to accept the inevitable the better
the drawn features of the old man showed that the words had a depressing effect upon his mind but florence interrupted her cousin with an indignant protest
how can you speak so curtis
she exclaimed
leave uncle john the hope that he has so long cherished
i have a presentiment that harvey still lives
john linden's face brightened up you too believe it possible florence
he said eagerly
yes uncle
i not only believe it possible but probable
how old would harvey be if he still lived
eighteennearly a year older than yourself
how strange
i always think of him as a little boy
and i too florence
he rises before me in his little velvet suit as he was when i last saw him with his sweet boyish face in which his mother's looks were reflected
yet if still living interrupted curtis harshly he is a rough street boy perchance serving his time at blackwell's island and a hardened young ruffian whom it would be bitter mortification to recognize as your son
that's the sorrowful part of it said his uncle in a voice of anguish
that is what i most dread
then since even if he were living you would not care to recognize him why not cease to think of him or else regard him as dead
curtis waring have you no heart
demanded florence indignantly
indeed florence you ought to know said curtis sinking his voice into softly modulated accents
i know nothing of it said florence coldly rising from her recumbent position and drawing aloof from curtis
you know that the dearest wish of my heart is to find favor in your eyes
uncle you know my wish and approve of it do you not
yes curtis you and florence are equally dear to me and it is my hope that you may be united
in that case there will be no division of my fortune
it will be left to you jointly
believe me sir said curtis with faltering voice feigning an emotion which he did not feel believe me that i fully appreciate your goodness
i am sure florence joins with me florence can speak for herself said his cousin coldly
my uncle needs no assurance from me
he is always kind and i am always grateful
john linden seemed absorbed in thought
i do not doubt your affection he said and i have shown it by making you my joint heirs in the event of your marriage but it is only fair to say that my property goes to my boy if he still lives
but sir protested curtis is not that likely to create unnecessary trouble
it can never be known and meanwhile you and florence will hold the property in trust
have you so specified in your will
asked curtis
i have made two wills
both are in yonder secretary
by the first the property is bequeathed to you and florence
by the second and later it goes to my lost boy in the event of his recovery
of course you and florence are not forgotten but the bulk of the property goes to harvey
i sincerely wish the boy might be restored to you said curtis but his tone belied his words
believe me the loss of the property would affect me little if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest desire but uncle i think it only the part of a friend to point out to you as i have already done the baselessness of any such expectation
it may be as you say curtis said his uncle with a sigh
if i were thoroughly convinced of it i would destroy the later will and leave my property absolutely to you and florence
no uncle said florence impulsively make no change let the will stand
curtis screened from his uncle's view darted a glance of bitter indignation at florence
is the girl mad
he muttered to himself
must she forever balk me
let it be so for the present then said mr linden wearily
curtis will you ring the bell
i am tired and shall retire to my couch early
let me help you uncle john said florence eagerly
it is too much for your strength my child
i am growing more and more helpless
i too can help said curtis
john linden supported on either side by his nephew and niece left the room and was assisted to his chamber
curtis and florence returned to the library
florence said her cousin my uncle's intentions as expressed tonight make it desirable that there should be an understanding between us
take a seat beside meleading her to a sofaand let us talk this matter over
with a gesture of repulsion florence declined the proffered seat and remained standing
as you please she answered coldly
will you be seated
no our interview will be brief
then i will come to the point
uncle john wishes to see us united
it can never be
said florence decidedly
curtis bit his lip in mortification for her tone was cold and scornful
mingled with this mortification was genuine regret for so far as he was capable of loving any one he loved his fair young cousin
you profess to love uncle john and yet you would disappoint his cherished hope
he returned
is it his cherished hope
there is no doubt about it
he has spoken to me more than once on the subject
feeling that his end is near he wishes to leave you in charge of a protector
i can protect myself said florence proudly
you think so
you do not consider the hapless lot of a penniless girl in a cold and selfish world
penniless
repeated florence in an accent of surprise
yes penniless
our uncle's bequest to you is conditional upon your acceptance of my hand
has he said this
asked florence sinking into an armchair with a helpless look
he has told me so more than once returned curtis smoothly
you don't know how near to his heart this marriage is
i know what you would say if the property comes to me i could come to your assistance but i am expressly prohibited from doing so
i have pleaded with my uncle in your behalf but in vain
florence was too clearsighted not to penetrate his falsehood
if my uncle's heart is hardened against me she said i shall be too wise to turn to you
i am to understand then that my choice lies between poverty and a union with you
you have stated it correctly florence
then said florence arising i will not hesitate
i shrink from poverty for i have been reared in luxury but i will sooner live in a hovel or a tenement house interjected curtis with a sneer
yes or a tenement house than become the wife of one i loathe
girl you shall bitterly repent that word
said curtis stung to fury
she did not reply but pale and sorrowful glided from the room to weep bitter tears in the seclusion of her chamber
chapter ii
a stranger visitor
curtis waring followed the retreating form of his cousin with a sardonic smile
she is in the toils
she cannot escape me
he muttered
butand here his brow darkenedit vexes me to see how she repels my advances as if i were some loathsome thing
if only she would return my lovefor i do love her cold as she isi should be happy
can there be a rival
but no
we live so quietly that she has met no one who could win her affection
why can she not turn to me
surely i am not so illfavored and though twice her age i am still a young man
nay it is only a young girl's caprice
she shall yet come to my arms a willing captive
his thoughts took a turn as he arose from his seat and walked over to the secretary
so it is here that the two wills are deposited
he said to himself one making me a rich man the other a beggar
while the last is in existence i am not safe
the boy may be alive and liable to turn up at any moment
if only he were deador the will destroyed here he made a suggestive pause
he took a bunch of keys from his pocket and tried one after another but without success
he was so absorbed in his work that he did not notice the entrance of a darkbrowed broadshouldered man dressed in a shabby corduroy suit till the intruder indulged in a short cough intended to draw attention
starting with guilty consciousness curtis turned sharply around and his glance fell on the intruder
who are you
he demanded angrily
and how dare you enter a gentleman's house unbidden
are you the gentleman
asked the intruder with intentional insolence
yes
you own this house
not at present
it is my uncle's
and that secretarypardon my curiosityis his
yes but what business is it of yours
not much
only it makes me laugh to see a gentleman picking a lock
you should leave such business to men like me
you are an insolent fellow
said curtis more embarrassed than he liked to confess for this roughlooking man had become possessed of a dangerous secret
i am my uncle's confidential agent and it was on business of his that i wished to open the desk
why not go to him for the key
because he is sick
but pshaw
why should i apologize or give any explanation to you
what can you know of him or me
more perhaps than you suspect said the intruder quietly
then you know perhaps that i am my uncle's heir
don't be too sure of that
look here fellow said curtis thoroughly provoked i don't know who you are nor what you mean but let me inform you that your presence here is an intrusion and the sooner you leave the house the better
i will leave it when i get ready
curtis started to his feet and advanced to his visitor with an air of menace
go at once he exclaimed angrily or i will kick you out of the door
what's the matter with the window
returned the stranger with an insolent leer
that's as you prefer but if you don't leave at once i will eject you
by way of reply the rough visitor coolly seated himself in a luxurious easychair and looking up into the angry face of waring said oh no you won't
and why not may i ask
said curtis with a feeling of uneasiness for which he could not account
why not
because in that case i should seek an interview with your uncle and tell him what
that his son still lives and that i can restore him to his the face of curtis waring blanched he staggered as if he had been struck and he cried out hoarsely it is a lie
it is the truth begging your pardon
do you mind my smoking
and he coolly produced a common clay pipe filled and lighted it
who are you
asked curtis scanning the man's features with painful anxiety
have you forgotten tim bolton
are you tim bolton
faltered curtis
yes but you don't seem glad to see me
i thought you were in australia
so i was three years since
then i got homesick and came back to new york
you have been here three years
yes chuckled bolton
you didn't suspect it did you
where
asked curtis in a hollow voice
i keep a saloon on the bowery
there's my card
call around when convenient
curtis was about to throw the card into the grate but on second thought dropped it into his pocket
and the boy
he asked slowly
is alive and well
he hasn't been starved
though i dare say you wouldn't have grieved if he had
and he is actually in this city
just so
does he know anything ofyou know what i mean
he doesn't know that he is the son of a rich man and heir to the property which you look upon as yours
that's what you mean isn't it
yes
what is he doing
is he at work
he helps me some in the saloon sells papers in the evenings and makes himself generally useful
has he any education
well i haven't sent him to boarding school or college answered tim
he don't know no greek or latin or mathematicsphew that's a hard word
you didn't tell me you wanted him made a scholar of
i didn't
i wanted never to see or hear from him again
what made you bring him back to new york
couldn't keep away governor
i got homesick i did
there ain't but one bowery in the world and i hankered after that didn't i pay you money to keep away tim bolton
i don't deny it but what's three thousand dollars
why the kid's cost me more than that
i've had the care of him for fourteen years and it's only about two hundred a year
you have broken your promise to me
said curtis sternly
there's worse things than breaking your promise retorted bolton
scarcely had he spoken than a change came over his face and he stared openmouthed behind him and beyond curtis
startled himself curtis turned and saw with a feeling akin to dismay the tall figure of his uncle standing on the threshold of the left portal clad in a morning gown with his eyes fixed inquiringly upon bolton and himself
chapter iii
an unholy compact
who is that man curtis
asked john linden pointing his thin finger at tim bolton who looked strangely out of place as with clay pipe he sat in the luxurious library on a sumptuous chair
that man
stammered curtis quite at a loss what to say
yes
he is a poor man out of luck who has applied to me for assistance answered curtis recovering his wits
that's it governor said bolton thinking it necessary to confirm the statement
i've got five small children at home almost starvin' your honor
that is sad
what is your business my man
it was bolton's turn to be embarrassed
my business
he repeated
that is what i said
i'm a blacksmith but i'm willing to do any honest work
that is commendable but don't you know that it is very illbred to smoke a pipe in a gentleman's house
excuse me governor
and bolton extinguished his pipe and put it away in a pocket of his corduroy coat
i was just telling him the same thing said curtis
don't trouble yourself any further uncle
i will inquire into the man's circumstances and help him if i can
very well curtis
i came down because i thought i heard voices
john linden slowly returned to his chamber and left the two alone
the governor's getting old said bolton
when i was butler here fifteen years ago he looked like a young man
he didn't suspect that he had ever seen me before
nor that you had carried away his son bolton
who hired me to do it
who put me up to the job as far as that goes
hush
walls have ears
let us return to business
that suits me
look here tim bolton said curtis drawing up a chair and lowering his voice to a confidential pitch you say you want money
of course i do
well i don't give money for nothing
i know that
what's wanted now
you say the boy is alive
he's very much alive
is there any necessity for his living
asked curtis in a sharp hissing tone fixing his eyes searchingly on bolton to see how his hint would be taken
you mean that you want me to murder him
said bolton quickly
why not
you don't look over scrupulous
i am a bad man i admit it said bolton with a gesture of repugnance a thief a low blackguard perhaps but thank heaven
i am no murderer
and if i was i wouldn't spill a drop of that boy's blood for the fortune that is his by right
i didn't give you credit for so much sentiment bolton said curtis with a sneer
you don't look like it but appearances are deceitful
we'll drop the subject
you can serve me in another way
can you open this secretary
yes that's in my line
there is a paper in it that i want
it is my uncle's will
i have a curiosity to read it
i understand
well i'm agreeable
if you find any money or valuables you are welcome to them
i only want the paper
when will you make the attempt
tomorrow night
when will it be safe
at eleven o'clock
we all retire early in this house
can you force an entrance
yes but it will be better for you to leave the outer door unlocked
i have a better plan
here is my latchkey
good
i may not do the job myself but i will see that it is done
how shall i know the will
it is in a big envelope tied with a narrow tape
probably it is inscribed 'my will'
suppose i succeed when shall i see you
i will come around to your place on the bowery
goodnight
curtis waring saw bolton to the door and let him out
returning he flung himself on a sofa
i can make that man useful
he reflected
there is an element of danger in the boy's presence in new york but it will go hard if i can't get rid of him
tim bolton is unexpectedly squeamish but there are others to whom i can apply
with gold everything is possible
it's time matters came to a finish
my uncle's health is rapidly failing the doctor hints that he has heart diseaseand the fortune for which i have been waiting so long will soon be mine if i work my cards right
i can't afford to make any mistakes now
chapter iv
florence
florence linden sat in the library the following evening in an attitude of depression
her eyelids were swollen and it was evident she had been weeping
during the day she had had an interview with her uncle in which he harshly insisted upon her yielding to his wishes and marrying her cousin curtis
but uncle she objected i do not love him
marry him and love will come
never
she said vehemently
you speak confidently miss said mr linden with irritation
listen uncle john
it is not alone that i do not love him
i dislike himi loathehim
nonsense
that is a young girl's extravagant nonsense
no uncle
there can be no reason for such a foolish dislike
what can you have against him
it is impressed upon me uncle that curtis is a bad man
there is something falsetreacherousabout him
pooh
child
you are more foolish than i thought
i don't say curtis is an angel
no man is at least i never met any such
but he is no worse than the generality of men
in marrying him you will carry out my cherished wish
florence i have not long to live
i shall be glad to see you well established in life before i leave you
as the wife of curtis you will have a recognized position
you will go on living in this house and the old home will be maintained
but why is it necessary for me to marry at all uncle john
you will be sure to marry some one
should i divide my fortune between you and curtis you would become the prey of some unscrupulous fortune hunter
better that than become the wife of curtis waring i see you are incorrigible said her uncle angrily
do you refuse obedience to my wishes
command me in anything else uncle john and i will obey pleaded florence
indeed
you only thwart me in my cherished wish but are willing to obey me in unimportant matters
you forget the debt you owe me
i forget nothing dear uncle
i do not forget that when i was a poor little child helpless and destitute you took me in your arms gave me a home and have cared for me from that time to this as only a parent could
you remember that then
yes uncle
i hope you will not consider me wholly ungrateful
it only makes matters worse
you own your obligations yet refuse to make the only return i desire
you refuse to comfort me in the closing days of my life by marrying your cousin
because that so nearly concerns my happiness that no one has a right to ask me to sacrifice all i hold dear
i see you are incorrigible said john linden stormily
do you know what will be the consequences
i am prepared for all
then listen
if you persist in balking me i shall leave the entire estate to curtis
do with your money as you will uncle
i have no claim to more than i have received
you are right there but that is not all
florence fixed upon him a mute look of inquiry
i will give you twentyfour hours more to come to your senses
then if you persist in your ingratitude and disobedience you must find another home
oh uncle you do not mean that
exclaimed florence deeply moved
i do mean it and i shall not allow your tears to move me
not another word for i will not hear it
take twentyfour hours to think over what i have said
florence bowed her head on her hands and gave herself up to sorrowful thoughts
but she was interrupted by the entrance of the servant who announced mr percy de brabazon
an effeminatelooking young man foppishly dressed followed the servant into the room and made it impossible for florence to deny herself as she wished to do
i hope i see you well miss florence he simpered
thank you mr de brabazon said florence coldly
i have a slight headache
i am awfully sorry i am upon my word miss florence
my doctor tells me it is only those whose bwains are vewy active that are troubled with headaches
then i presume mr de brabazon said florence with intentional sarcasm that you never have a headache
weally miss florence that is vewy clevah
you will have your joke
it was no joke i assure you mr de brabazon
ii thought it might be
didn't i see you at the opewa last evening
possibly
i was there
i often go to the opewa
it's soso fashionable don't you know
then you don't go to hear the music
oh of course but one can't always be listening to the music don't you know
i had a fwiend with me last eveningan englishmana charming fellow i assure you
he's the second cousin of a lord and yetyou'll hardly credit itwe're weally vewy intimate
he tells me miss florence that i'm the perfect image of his cousin lord fitz noodle
i am not at all surprised
weally you are vewy kind miss florence
i thought it a great compliment
i don't know how it is but evewybody takes me for an englishman
strange isn't it
i am very glad
may i ask why miss florence
because well perhaps i had better not explain
it seems to give you pleasure
you would probably prefer to be an englishman
i admit that i have a great admiration for the english character
it's a gweat pity we have no lords in america
now if you would only allow me to bring my english fwiend here i don't care to make any new acquaintances
even if i did i prefer my own countrymen
don't you like america mr de brabazon
oh of courth if we only had some lords here
we have plenty of flunkeys
that's awfully clevah 'pon my word
is it
i am afraid you are too complimentary
you are very goodnatured
i always feel goodnatured in your company miss florence
iwish i could always be with you
really
wouldn't that be a trifle monotonous
asked florence sarcastically
not if we were married said percy boldly breaking the ice
what do you mean mr de brabazon
i hope you will excuse me miss florencemiss linden i mean but i'm awfully in love with you and have been ever so longbut i never dared to tell you so
i felt so nervous don't you know
will you marry me
i'll be awfully obliged if you will
mr de brabazon rather awkwardly slipped from his chair and sank on one knee before florence
please arise mr de brabazon said florence hurriedly
it is quite out of the questionwhat you aski assure you
ah
i see how it is said percy clasping his hands sadly
you love another
not that i am aware of
then i may still hope
i cannot encourage you mr de brabazon
my heart is free but it can never be yours
then said percy gloomily there is only one thing for me to do
what is that
i shall go to the bwooklyn bwidge climb to the parapet jump into the water and end my misewable life
you had better think twice before adopting such a desperate resolution mr de brabazon
you will meet others who will be kinder to you than i have been i can never love another
my heart is broken
farewell cruel girl
when you read the papers tomorrow morning think of the unhappy percy de brabazon
mr de brabazon folded his arms gloomily and stalked out of the room
if my position were not so sad i should be tempted to smile said florence
mr de brabazon will not do this thing
his emotions are as strong as those of a butterfly
after a brief pause florence seated herself at the table and drew toward her writing materials
it is i whose heart should be broken
she murmured i who am driven from the only home i have ever known
what can have turned against me my uncle usually so kind and considerate
it must be that curtis has exerted a baneful influence upon him
i cannot leave him without one word of farewell
she took up a sheet of paper and wrote rapidly dear uncle you have told me to leave your house and i obey
i cannot tell you how sad i feel when i reflect that i have lost your love and must go forth among strangersi know not where
i was but a little girl when you gave me a home
i have grown up in an atmosphere of love and i have felt very grateful to you for all you have done for me
i have tried to conform to your wishes and i would obey you in all elsebut i cannot marry curtis i think i would rather die
let me still live with you as i have done
i do not care for any part of your moneyleave it all to him if you think bestbut give me back my place in your heart
you are angry now but you will some time pity and forgive your poor florence who will never cease to bless and pray for you
goodbye
florence
she was about to sign herself florence linden but reflected that she was no longer entitled to use a name which would seem to carry with it a claim upon her uncle
the tears fell upon the paper as she was writing but she heeded them not
it was the saddest hour of her life
hitherto she had been shielded from all sorrow and secure in the affection of her uncle had never dreamed that there would come a time when she would feel obliged to leave all behind her and go out into the world friendless and penniless but poorest of all in the loss of that love which she had hitherto enjoyed
after completing the note florence let her head fall upon the table and sobbed herself to sleep
an hour and a half passed the servant looked in but noticing that her mistress was sleeping contented herself with lowering the gas but refrained from waking her
and so she slept on till the french clock upon the mantle struck eleven
five minutes later and the door of the room slowly opened and a boy entered on tiptoe
he was roughly dressed
his figure was manly and vigorous and despite his stealthy step and suspicious movements his face was prepossessing
he started when he saw florence
what a sleeping gal
he said to himself
tim told me i'd find the coast clear but i guess she's sound asleep and won't hear nothing
i don't half like this job but i've got to do as tim told me
he says he's my father so i s'pose it's all right
all the same i shall be nabbed some day and then the family'll be disgraced
it's a queer life i've led ever since i can remember
sometimes i feel like leaving tim and settin' up for myself
i wonder how 'twould seem to be respectable
the boy approached the secretary and with some tools he had brought essayed to open it
after a brief delay he succeeded and lifted the cover
he was about to explore it according to tim's directions when he heard a cry of fear and turning swiftly saw florence her eyes dilated with terror gazing at him
who are you
she asked in alarm and what are you doing there
chapter v dodger
the boy sprang to the side of florence and siezed her wrists in his strong young grasp
don't you alarm the house he said or i'll what will you do
gasped florence in alarm
the boy was evidently softened by her beauty and answered in a tone of hesitation i don't know
i won't harm you if you keep quiet
what are you here for
asked florence fixing her eyes on the boy's face are you a thief
i don't knowyes i suppose i am
how sad when you are so young
what
miss do you pity me
yes my poor boy you must be very poor or you wouldn't bring yourself to steal
no
i ain't poor leastways i have enough to eat and i have a place to sleep
then why don't you earn your living by honest means
i can't i must obey orders
whose orders
why the guv'nor's to be sure
did he tell you to open that secretary
yes
who is the guv'nor as you call him
i can't tell it wouldn't be square
he must be a very wicked man
well he ain't exactly what you call an angel but i've seen wuss men than the guv'nor
do you mind telling me your own name
no for i know you won't peach on me
tom dodger
dodger
yes
that isn't a surname
it's all i've got
that's what i'm always called
it is very singular said florence fixing a glance of mingled curiosity and perplexity upon the young visitor
while the two were earnestly conversing in that subdued light afforded by the lowered gaslight tim bolton crept in through the door unobserved by either tiptoed across the room to the secretary snatched the will and a roll of bills and escaped without attracting attention
oh i wish i could persuade you to give up this bad life resumed florence earnestly and become honest
do you really care what becomes of me miss
asked dodger slowly
i do indeed
that's very kind of you miss but i don't understand it
you are a rich young lady and i'm only a poor boy livin' in a bowery dive
what's that
never mind miss such as you wouldn't understand
why all my life i've lived with thieves and drunkards and bunco men and but i'm sure you don't like it
you are fit for something better
do you really think so
asked dodger doubtfullly
yes you have a good face
you were meant to be good and honest i am sure
would you trust me
asked the boy earnestly fixing his large dark eyes eloquently on the face of florence
yes i would if you would only leave your evil companions and become true to your better nature
no one ever spoke to me like that before miss said dodger his expressive features showing that he was strongly moved
you think i could be good if i tried hard and grow up respectable
i am sure you could said florence confidently
there was something in this boy young outlaw though he was that moved her powerfully and even fascinated her though she hardly realized it
it was something more than a feeling of compassion for a wayward and misguided youth
i could if i was rich like you and lived in a nice house and 'sociated with swells
if you had a father like mine is he a bad man
well he don't belong to the church
he keeps a gin mill and has ever since i was a kid
have you always lived with him
yes but not in new york
where then
in melbourne
that's in australia
yes miss
how long since you came to new york
i guess it's about three years
and you have always had this man as a guardian
poor boy
you've got a different father from me miss
tears forced themselves to the eyes of florence as this remark brought forcibly to her mind the position in which she was placed
alas
she answered impulsively i am alone in the world
what
ain't the old gentleman that lives here your father
he is my uncle but he is very very angry with me and has this very day ordered me to leave the house
why what a cantankerous old ruffian he is to be sure
exclaimed the boy indignantly
hush
you must not talk against my uncle
he has always been kind to me till now
why what's up
what's the old gentleman mad about
he wants me to marry my cousin curtisa man i do not even like
that's a shame
is it the dude i saw come out of the house a little while ago
oh no that's a different gentleman
it's mr de brabazon
you don't want to marry him do you
no no
i'm glad of that
he don't look as if he knew enough to come in when it rained
the poor young man is not very brilliant but i think i would rather marry him than curtis waring
i've seen him too
he's got dark hair and a dark complexion and a wicked look in his eye
you too have noticed that
i've seen such as him before
he's a bad man
do you know anything about him
asked florence eagerly
only his looks
i am not deceived murmured florence it's not wholly prejudice
the boy distrusts him too
so you see dodger she added aloud i am not a rich young lady as you suppose
i must leave this house and work for my living
i have no home any more
if you have no home said dodger impulsively come home with me
to the home you have described my poor boy
how could i do that
no i will hire a room for you in a quiet street and you shall be my sister
i will work for you and give you my money
you are kind and i am glad to think i have found a friend when i need one most
but i could not accept stolen money
it would be as bad as if i too were a thief
i am not a thief
that is i won't be any more
and you will give up your plan of robbing my uncle
yes i will though i don't know what my guv'nor will say
he'll half murder me i expect
he'll be sure to cut up rough
do right dodger whatever happens
promise me that you will never steal again
there's my hand missi promise
nobody ever talked to me like you
i never thought much about bein' respectable and growin' up to be somebody but if you take an interest in me i'll try hard to do right
at this moment mr linden clad in a long morning gown and holding a candle in his hand entered the room and started in astonishment when he saw florence clasping the hand of one whose appearance led him to stamp as a young rough
shameless girl
he exclaimed in stern reproof
so this is the company you keep when you think i am out of the way
chapter vi
a tempest
the charge was so strange and unexpected that florence was overwhelmed
she could only murmur oh uncle
her young companion was indignant
already he felt that florence had consented to accept him as a friend and he was resolved to stand by her
i say old man he bristled up don't you go to insult her
she's an angel
no doubt you think so rejoined mr linden in a tone of sarcasm
upon my word miss i congratulate you on your elevated taste
so this is your reason for not being willing to marry your cousin curtis
indeed uncle you are mistaken
i never met this boy till tonight
don't try to deceive me
young man did you open my secretary
yes sir
and robbed it into the bargain continued linden going to the secretary and examining it
he did not however miss the will but only the roll of bills
give me back the money you have taken from me you young rascal
i took nothing sir
it's a lie
the money is gone and no one else could have taken it
i don't allow no one to call me a liar
just take that back old man or i indeed uncle he took nothing for he had only just opened the secretary when i woke up and spoke to him
you stand by him of course shameless girl
i blush to think that you are my niece
i am glad to think that my eyes are opened before it is too late
the old merchant rang the bell violently and aroused the house
dodger made no attempt to escape but stood beside florence in the attitude of a protector
but a short time elapsed before curtis waring and the servants entered the room and gazed with wonder at the tableau presented by the excited old man and the two young people
my friends said john linden in a tone of excitement i call you to witness that this girl whom i blush to acknowledge as my niece has proved herself unworthy of my kindness
in your presence i cut her off and bid her never again darken my door
but what has she done uncle
asked curtis
he was prepared for the presence of dodger whom he rightly concluded to be the agent of tim bolton but he could not understand why florence should be in the library at this late hour
nor was he able to understand the evidently friendly relations between her and the young visitor
what has she done
repeated john linden
she has introduced that young ruffian into the house to rob me
look at that secretary
he has forced it open and stolen a large sum of money
it is not true sir said dodger calmly about taking the money i mean
i haven't taken a cent
then why did you open the secretary
i did mean to take money but she stopped me
oh she stopped you
repeated linden with withering sarcasm
then perhaps you will tell me where the money is gone
he hasn't discovered about the will thought curtis congratulating himself if the boy has it i must manage to give him a chance to escape
you can search me if you want to continued dodger proudly
you won't find no money on me
do you think i am a fool you young burglar
exclaimed john linden angrily
uncle let me speak to the boy said curtis soothingly
i think he will tell me
as you like curtis but i am convinced that he is a thief
curtis waring beckoned dodger into an adjoining room
now my boy he said smoothly give me what you took from the secretary and i will see that you are not arrested
but sir i didn't take nothingit's just as i told the old duffer
the girl waked up just as i'd got the secretary open and i didn't have a chance
but the money is gone said curtis in an incredulous tone
i don't know nothing about that
come you'd better examine your pockets
in the hurry of the moment you may have taken it without knowing it
no i couldn't
didn't you take a paper of any kind
asked curtis eagerly
sometimes papers are of more value than money
no i didn't take no paper though tim told me to
curtis quietly ignored the allusion to tim for it did not suit his purpose to get tim into trouble
his unscrupulous agent knew too much that would compromise his principal
are you willing that i should examine you
yes i am
go ahead
curtis thrust his hand into the pockets of the boy who boy as he was was as tall as himself but was not repaid by the discovery of anything
he was very much perplexed
didn't you throw the articles on the floor
he demanded suspiciously
no i didn't
you didn't give them to the young lady
no if i had she'd have said so
humph
this is strange
what is your name
dodger
that's a queer name have you no other
not as i know of
with whom do you live
with my father
leastways he says he's my father
there was a growing suspicion in the mind of curtis waring
he scanned the boy's features with attention
could this illdressed boya street boy in appearancebe his longlost and deeply wronged cousin
who is it that says he is your father
he demanded abruptly
do you want to get him into trouble
no i don't want to get him into trouble or you either
better tell me all and i will be your friend
you're a better sort than i thought at first said dodger
the man i live with is called tim bolton
i though so quickly ejaculated curtis
he had scarcely got out the words before he was sensible that he had made a mistake
what
do you know tim
inquired dodger in surprise
i mean replied curtis lamely that i have heard of this man bolton
he keeps a saloon on the bowery doesn't he
yes
i thought you would be living with some such man
did he come to the house with you tonight
yes
where is he
he stayed outside
perhaps he is there now
don't you go to having him arrested said dodger suspiciously
i will keep my promise
are you sure you didn't pass out the paper and the money to him
think now
no i didn't
i didn't have a chance
when i came into the room yonder i saw the gal asleep and i thought she wouldn't hear me but when i got the desk open she spoke to me and asked me what i was doin'
and you took nothing
no
it seems very strange
i cannot understand it
yet my uncle says the money is gone
did anyone else enter the room while you were talking with miss linden
i didn't see any one
what were you talking about
she said the old man wanted her to marry you and she didn't want to
she told you that
exclaimed curtis in displeasure
yes she did
she said she'd rather marry the dude that was here early this evenin'
mr de brabazon
yes that's the name
upon my word she was very confidential
you are a queer person for her to select as a confidant
maybe so sir but she knows i'm her friend
you like the young lady then
perhaps you would like to marry her yourself
as if she'd take any notice of a poor boy like me
i told her if her uncle sent her away i'd take care of her and be a brother to her
how would mr tim boltonthat's his name isn't itlike that
i wouldn't take her to where he lives
i think myself it would hardly be a suitable home for a young lady brought up on madison avenue
there is certainly no accounting for tastes
miss florence that's her name is it
yes didn't she tell you
no but it's a nice name
she declines my hand and accepts your protection
it will certainly be a proud distinction to become mrs
dodger
don't laugh at her
said dodger suspiciously
i don't propose to
but i think we may as well return to the library
well said mr linden as his nephew returned with dodger
i have examined the boy and found nothing on his person said curtis i confess i am puzzled
he appears to have a high admiration for florence as i supposed
she has even confided to him her dislike for me and he has offered her his protection
is this so miss
demanded mr linden sternly
yes uncle faltered florence
then you can join the young person you have selected whenever you please
for your sake i will not have him arrested for attempted burglary
he is welcome to what he has taken since he is likely to marry into the family
you may stay here tonight and he can call for you in the morning
john linden closed the secretary and left the room leaving florence sobbing
the servants too retired and curtis was left alone with her
florence he said accept my hand and i will reconcile my uncle to you
say but the word and i can never speak it curtis
i will take my uncle at his word
dodger call for me tomorrow at eight and i will accept your friendly services in finding me a new home
i'll be on hand miss
goodnight
be it so obstinate girl
said curtis angrily
the time will come when you will bitterly repent your mad decision
chapter vii
florence leaves home
florence passed a sleepless night
it had come upon her so suddenly this expulsion from the home of her childhood that she could not fully realize it
she could not feel that she was taking her last look at the familiar room and wellremembered diningroom where she had sat down for the last time for breakfast
she was alone at the breakfast table for the usual hour was halfpast eight and she had appointed dodger to call for her at eight
is it true miss florence that you're going away
asked jane the warmhearted table girl as she waited upon florence
yes jane answered florence sadly
it's a shame so it is
i didn't think your uncle would be so hardhearted
he is disappointed because i won't marry my cousin curtis
i don't blame you for it miss
i never liked mr waring
he isn't half good enough for you
i say nothing about that jane but i will not marry a man i do not love
nor would i miss
where are you going if i may make so bold
i don't know jane said florence despondently
but you can't walk about the streets
a trusty friend is going to call for me at eight o'clock when he comes admit him
it is aa young gentleman
you wouldn't call him such
he is a boy a poor boy but i think he is a true friend
he says he will find me a comfortable room somewhere where i can settle down and look for work
are you going to work for a living miss florence
asked jane horrified
i must jane
it's a great shameyou a lady born
no jane i do not look upon it in that light
i shall be happier for having my mind and my hands occupied
what work will you do
i don't know yet
dodger will advise me
who miss
dodger
who is he
it's the boy i spoke of
shure he's got a quare name
yes but names don't count for much
it's the heart i think of and this boy has a kind heart
have you known him long
i saw him yesterday for the first time
is it the young fellow who was here last night
yes
he isn't fit company for the likes of you miss florence
you forget jane that i am no longer a rich young lady
i am poorer than even you
this dodger is kind and i feel that i can trust him
if you are poor miss florence said jane hesitatingly would you mind borrowing some money of me
i've got ten dollars upstairs in my trunk and i don't need it at all
it's proud i'll be to lend it to you
thank you jane said florence gratefully
i thought i had but one friend
i find i have two then you'll take the money
i'll go right up and get it
no jane not at present
i have twenty dollars in my purse and it will last me till i can earn more
but miss twenty dollars will soon go said jane disappointed
if i find that i need the sum you so kindly offer me i will let you know i promise that
thank you miss
at this point a bell rang from above
it's from mr curtis' room said jane
go and see what he wants
jane returned in a brief time with a note in her hand
mr curtis asked me if you were still here she explained and when i told him you were he asked me to give you this
florence took the note and opening it read these lines florence now that you have had time to think over your plan of leaving your old home i hope you have come to see how foolish it is
reflect that if carried out a life of poverty and squalid wretchedness amid homely and uncongenial surroundings awaits you while as my wife you will live a life of luxury and high social position
there are many young ladies who would be glad to accept the chance which you so recklessly reject
by accepting my hand you will gratify our excellent uncle and make me the happiest of mortals
you will acquit me of mercenary motives since you are now penniless and your disobedience leaves me sole heir to uncle john
i love you and it will be my chief object if you will permit it to make you happy
curtis waring
florence ran her eyes rapidly over this note but her heart did not respond and her resolution was not shaken
tell mr waring there is no answer jane if he inquires she said
was he tryin' to wheedle you into marryin' him
asked jane
he wished me to change my decision
i'm glad you've given him the bounce said jane whose expressions were not always refined
i wouldn't marry him myself
florence smiled
jane was red haired and her nose was what is euphemistically called retrousse
even in her own circles she was not regarded as beautiful and was hardly likely to lead a rich man to overlook her humble station and sue for her hand
then jane you at least will not blame me for refusing my cousin's hand
that i won't miss
do you know miss florenceand here jane lowered her voicei've a suspicion that mr curtis is married already
what do you mean jane
asked florence startled
there was a poor young woman called here last month and inquired for mr curtis
she was very sorrowfullike and poorly dressed
he came up when she was at the door and he spoke harshlike and told her to walk away with him
what they said i couldn't hear but i've a suspicion that she was married to him secretlike for i saw a wedding ring upon her finger
but jane it would be base and infamous for him to ask for my hand when he was already married
i can't help it miss
that's just what he wouldn't mind doin'
oh he's a sly deceiver mr curtis
i'd like to see him foolin' around me
jane nodded her head with emphasis as if to intimate the kind of reception curtis waring would get if he attempted to trifle with her virgin affections
i hope what you suspect is not true said florence gravely
i do not like or respect curtis but i don't like to think he would be so base as that
if you ever see this young woman again try to find out where she lives
i would like to make her acquaintance and be a friend to her if she needs one
shure miss florence you will be needin' a friend yourself
it is true jane
i forgot that i am no longer a young lady of fortune but a penniless girl obliged to work for a living
what would your uncle say if he knew that mr curtis had a wife
we don't know that he has one and till we do it would not be honorable to intimate such a thing to uncle john
shure he wouldn't be particular
it's all his fault that you're obliged to leave home and go into the streets
why couldn't he take no for an answer and marry somebody else if he can find anybody to have him
i wish indeed that he had fixed his affections elsewhere responded florence with a sigh
shure he's twice as old as you miss florence anyway
i shouldn't mind that so much if that was the only objection
it'll be a great deal better marryin' a young man
i don't care to marry any one jane
i don't think i shall ever marry
it's all very well to say that miss florence
lots of girls say so but they change their minds
i don't mean to live out always myself
is there any young man you are interested in jane
maybe there is and maybe there isn't miss florence
if i ever do get married i'll invite you to the wedding
and i'll promise to come if i can
but i hear the bell
i think my friend dodger has come
shall i ask him in miss
no
tell him i will be ready to accompany him at once
she went out into the hall and when the door was opened the visitor proved to be dodger
he had improved his appearance so far as his limited means would allow
his hands and face were thoroughly clean he had bought a new collar and necktie his shoes were polished and despite his shabby suit he looked quite respectable
getting a full view of him florence saw that his face was frank and handsome his eyes bright and his teeth like pearls
shure he's a great deal better lookin' than mr curtis whispered jane
here mr dodger take miss florence's valise and mind you take good care of her
i will answered dodger heartily
come miss florence if you don't mind walking over to fourth avenue we'll take the horse cars
so under strange guidance florence linden left her luxurious home knowing not what awaited her
what haven of refuge she might find she knew not
she like dodger was adrift in new york
chapter viii
a friendly compact
florence as she stepped on the sidewalk turned and fixed a last sad look on the house that had been her home for so many years
she had never anticipated such a sundering of home ties and even now she found it difficult to realize that the moment had come when her life was to be rent in twain and the sunlight of prosperity was to be darkened and obscured by a gloomy and uncertain future
she had hastily packed a few indispensable articles in a valise which she carried in her hand
let me take your bag miss florence said dodger reaching out his hand
i don't want to trouble you dodger
it ain't no trouble miss florence
i'm stronger than you and it looks better for me to carry it
you are very kind dodger
what would i do without you
there's plenty that would be glad of the chance of helping you said dodger with a glance of admiration at the fair face of his companion
i don't know where to find them said florence sadly
even my uncle has turned against me
he's an old chump
ejaculated dodger in a tone of disgust
hush
i cannot hear a word against him
he has always been kind and considerate till now
it is the evil influence of my cousin curtis that has turned him against me
when he comes to himself i am sure he will regret his cruelty
he would take you back if you would marry your cousin
yes but that i will never do
exclaimed florence with energy
bully for you
said dodger
excuse me he said apologetically
i ain't used to talkin' to young ladies and perhaps that ain't proper for me to say
i don't mind dodger your heart is in the right place
thank you miss florence
i'm glad you've got confidence in me
i'll try to deserve it
where are we going
asked the young lady whose only thought up to this moment had been to get away from the presence of curtis and his persecutions
they had now reached fourth avenue and a surface car was close at hand
we're going to get aboard that car said dodger signaling with his free hand
i'll tell you more when we're inside
florence entered the car and dodger following took a seat at her side
they presented a noticeable contrast for florence was dressed as beseemed her station while dodger in spite of his manly attractive face was roughly attired and looked like a working boy
when the conductor came along he drew out a dime and tendered it in payment of the double fare
the money was in the conductor's hand before florence was fully aware
you must not pay for me dodger she said
why not
asked the boy
ain't we friends
yes but you have no money to spare
here let me return the money
and she offered him a dime from her own purse
you can pay next time miss florence
it's all right
now i'll tell you where we are goin'
a friend of mine mrs o'keefe has a lodgin' house just off the bowery
i saw her last night and she says she's got a good room that she can give you for two dollars a weeki don't know how much you'd be willing to pay but i can pay that for a time at least
i have a little money and i must find some work to do soon
is this mrs o'keefe a nice lady
she ain't a lady at all answered dodger bluntly
she keeps an applestand near the corner of bowery and grand street but she's a good respectable woman and she's goodhearted
she'll be kind to you and try to make things pleasant but if you ain't satisfied it will do for the present
kindness is what i need driven as i am from the home of my childhood
but you dodger where do you live
i'm goin' to take a small room in the same house miss florence
i shall be glad to have you near me
i am proud to hear you say that
i'm a poor boy and you're a rich lady but not rich dodger
i am as poor as yourself
you're a reg'lar lady anyway
you ain't one of my kind but i'm going to improve and raise myself
i was readin' the other day of a rich man that was once a poor boy and sold papers like me
but there's one thing in the wayi ain't got no eddication
you can read and write can't you dodger
yes i can read pretty well but i can't write much
i will teach you in the evenings when we are both at leisure
will you
asked the boy with a glad smile
you're very kindi'd like a teacher like you
then it's a bargain dodger and florence's face for the first time lost its sad look as she saw an opportunity of helping one who had befriended her
but you must promise to study faithfully
that i will
if i don't i'll give you leave to lick me
i shan't forget that said florence amused
i will buy a ruler of good hard wood and then you must look out
but tell me where have you lived hitherto
i don't like to tell you miss florence
i've lived ever since i was a kid with a man named tim bolton
he keeps a saloon on the bowery near houston street
it's a tough place i tell you
i've got a bed in one cornerit's tucked away in a closet in the day
i suppose it is a drinking saloon
yes that's what it is
and kept open very late
pretty much all night
is this tim bolton any relation of yours
he says he's my father but i don't believe it
have you always lived with him
ever since i was a small kid
have you always lived in new york
no i was out in australia
tim was out in the country part of the time and part of the time he kept a saloon in melbourne
there was thieves and burglars used to come into his place
i knew what they were though they didn't think i did
how terrible for a boy to be subjected to such influences
but i've made up my mind i won't live with tim no longer
i can earn my own livin' sellin' papers or smashin' baggage and keep away from tim
i'd have done it before if i'd had a friend like you to care for me
we will stand by each other dodger
heaven knows i need a friend and if i can be a friend to you and help you i will
we'll get out here miss florence
i told mrs o'keefe i'd call at her stand and she'll go over and show you your room
they left the car at the corner of grand street and dodger led the way to an applestand presided over by a lady of ample proportions whose broad celtic face seemed to indicate alike shrewd good sense and a kindly spirit
mrs o'keefe said dodger this is the young lady i spoke to you aboutmiss florence linden
it's welcome you are my dear and i'm very glad to make your acquaintance
you look like a rale leddy and i don't know how you'll like the room i've got for you
i cannot afford to be particular mrs o'keefe
i have had aa reverse of circumstances and i must be content with an humble home
then i'll go over and show it to you
here kitty come and mind the stand she called to a girl about thirteen across the street and don't let anybody steal the apples
look out for jimmy mahone he stole a couple of apples right under my nose this mornin' the young spalpeen
as they were crossing the street a boy of fourteen ran up to dodger
dodger said he you'd better go right over to tim bolton's
he's in an awful stewsays he'll skin you alive if you don't come to the s'loon right away
chapter ix
the new home
you can tell tim bolton said dodger that i don't intend to come back at all
you don't mean it dodger
said ben holt incredulously
yes i do
i'm going to set up for myself
oh dodger said florence i'm afraid you will get into trouble for my sake
don't worry about that miss florence
i'm old enough to take care of myself and i've got tired of livin' with tim
but he may beat you
he'll have to get hold of me first
they had reached a fourstory tenement of shabby brick which was evidently well filled up by a miscellaneous crowd of tenants shop girls mechanics laborers and widows living by their daily toil
florence had never visited this part of the city and her heart sank within her as she followed mrs o'keefe through a dirty hallway up a rickety staircase to the second floor
one more flight of stairs my dear said mrs o'keefe encouragingly
i've got four rooms upstairs one of them is for you and one for dodger
florence did not reply
she began to understand at what cost she had secured her freedom from a distasteful marriage
in her madison avenue home all the rooms were light clean and luxuriously furnished
here but words were inadequate to describe the contrast
mrs o'keefe threw open the door of a back room about twelve feet square furnished in the plainest manner uncarpeted except for a strip that was laid like a rug beside the bedstead
there was a washstand with a mirror twelve by fifteen inches placed above it a pine bureau a couple of wooden chairs and a caneseated rockingchair
there my dear what do you say to that
asked mrs o'keefe complacently
all nice and comfortable as you would wish to see
it isvery nice said florence faintly sacrificing truth to politeness
and who do you think used to live here
asked the applewoman
i'm sure i don't know
the bearded woman in the dime museum answered mrs o'keefe nodding her head
she lived with me three months and she furnished the room herself
when she went away she was hard up and i bought the furniture of her cheap
you remember madam berger don't you dodger
oh yes i seen her often
she got twentyfive dollars a week and she'd ought to have saved money but she had a goodfornothin' husband that drank up all her hard earnin's
i hope she didn't drink herself said florence who shuddered at the idea of succeeding a drunken tenant
not a drop
she was a good sober lady if she did work in a dime museum
she only left here two weeks ago
it isn't every one i'd be willin' to take in her place but i see you're a real leddy let alone that dodger recommends you
i hope you'll like the room and i'll do all i can to make things pleasant
you can go into my room any hour my dear and do your little cookin' on my stove
i s'pose you'll do your own cookin'
well not just at present faltered florence
i am afraid i don't know much about cooking
you'll find it a deal cheaper and it's more quiet and gentale than goin' to the eatin'houses
i'll help you all i can and glad to
thank you mrs o'keefe you are very kind said florence gratefully
perhaps just at first you wouldn't object to taking me as a boarder and letting me take my meals with you
i don't think i would like to go to the eatinghouses alone
to be sure my dear if you wish it and i'll be glad of your company
i'll make the terms satisfactory
i have no doubt of that said florence feeling very much relieved
if i might be so bold what kind of work are you going to do
i hardly know
it has come upon me so suddenly
i shall have to do something for i haven't got much money
what i should like best would be to write is it for the papers you mean
oh no i mean for some author or lawyer
i don't know much about that said mrs o'keefe
in fact i don't mind tellin' you my dear that i can't write myself but i earn a good livin' all the same by my applestand
i tell you my dear she continued in a confidential tone there is a good dale of profit in sellin' apples
it's better than sewin' or writin'
of course a young leddy like you wouldn't like to go into the business
florence shook her head with a smile
no mrs o'keefe she said
i am afraid i haven't a business turn and i should hardly like so public an employment
lor' miss it's nothin' if you get used to it
there's nothin' dull about my business unless it rains and you get used to havin' people look at you
it isn't all that are worth looking at like you mrs o'keefe said dodger slyly
oh go away wid your fun dodger said the applewoman goodnaturedly
i ain't much to look at i know
i think there's a good deal of you to look at mrs o'keefe
you must weigh near three hundred
i've a good mind to box your ears dodger
i only weigh a hundred and ninetyfive
but i can't be bothered wid your jokes
can you sew miss florence
yes but i would rather earn my living some other way if possible
small blame to you for that
i had a girl in dodger's room last year who used to sew for a livin'
early and late she worked poor thing and she couldn't make but two dollars a week
how could she live
asked florence startled for she knew very little of the starvation wages paid to toiling women
she didn't live
she just faded away and it's my belief the poor thing didn't get enough to eat
every day or two i'd make an excuse to take her in something from my own table a plate of meat or a bit of toast and a cup of tay makin' belave she didn't get a chance to cook for herself but she got thinner and thinner and her poor cheeks got hollow and she died in the hospital at last
the warmhearted applewoman wiped away a tear with the corner of her apron as she thought of the poor girl whose sad fate she described
you won't die of consumption mrs o'keefe said dodger
it'll take a good while for you to fade away
hear him now said the applewoman laughing
he will have his joke miss florence but he's a good bye for all that and i'm glad he's goin' to lave tim bolton that ould thafe of the worruld
now mrs o'keefe you know you'd marry tim if he'd only ask you
marry him is it
i'd lay my broom over his head if he had the impudence to ask me
when maggie o'keefe marries ag'in she won't marry a man wid a red nose
break it gently to him mrs o'keefe
tim is just the man to break his heart for love of you
mrs o'keefe aimed a blow at dodger but he proved true to his name and skillfully evaded it
i must be goin' he said
i've got to work or i can't pay room rent when the week comes round
what are you going to do dodger
asked florence
it isn't time for the evenin' papers yet so i shall go 'round to the piers and see if i can't get a job at smashin' baggage
but i shouldn't think any one would want to do that said florence puzzled
it's what we boys call it
it's just carryin' valises and bundles
sometimes i show strangers the way to broadway
last week an old man paid me a dollar to show him the way to the cooper institute
he was a gentleman he was
i'd like to meet him ag'in
goodby miss florence i'll be back some time this afternoon
and i must be goin' too said mrs o'keefe
i can't depend on that kitty she's a wild slip of a girl and just as like as not i'll find a dozen apples stole when i get back
i hope you won't feel lonely my dear
i think i will lie down a while said florence
i have a headache
she threw herself on the bed and a feeling of loneliness and desolation came over her
her new friends were kind but they could not make up to her for her uncle's love so strangely lost and the home she had left behind
chapter x
the arch conspirator
in the house on madison avenue curtis waring was left in possession of the field
through his machinations florence had been driven from home and disinherited
he was left sole heir to his uncle's large property with the prospect of soon succeeding for though only fiftyfour john linden looked at least ten years older and was as feeble as many men past seventy
yet as curtis seated himself at the breakfast table an hour after florence had left the house he looked far from happy or triumphant
one thing he had not succeeded in the conquest of his cousin's heart
though he loved himself best he was really in love with florence so far as he was capable of being in love with any one
she was only half his agescarcely thatbut he persuaded himself that the match was in every way suitable
he liked to fancy her at the head of his table after the death of his uncle which he anticipated in a few months at latest
the more she appeared to dislike him the more he determined to marry her even against her will
she was the only one likely to inherit john linden's wealth and by marrying her he would make sure of it
yet she had been willing to leave the home of her youth to renounce luxury for a life of poverty rather than to marry him
when he thought of this his face became set and its expression stern and determined
florence shall yet be mine he declared resolutely
i will yet be master of her fate and bend her to my will
foolish girl how dare she match her puny strength against the resolute will of curtis waring
was there any one else whom she loved
he asked himself anxiously
no he could think of none
on account of his uncle's chronic invalidism they had neither gone into society nor entertained visitors and in the midst of a great city florence and her uncle had practically led the lives of recluses
there had been no opportunity to meet young men who might have proved claimants for her hand
when did miss florence leave the house jane
he inquired as he seated himself at the table
most an hour since the girl answered coldly for she disliked curtis as much as she loved and admired florence
it is sad very sad that she should be so headstrong said curtis with hypocritical sorrow
it is sad for her to go away from her own uncle's house returned jane
and veryvery foolish
i don't know about that sir
she had her reasons said jane significantly
curtis coughed
he had no doubt that florence had talked over the matter with her handmaiden
did she say where she was going jane
he asked
i don't think the poor child knew herself sir
did she go alone
no sir the boy that was here last night called for her
that ragamuffin
said curtis scornfully
she certainly shows extraordinary taste for a young lady of family
the boy seems a very kind and respectable boy said jane who had been quite won by dodger's kindness to her young mistress
he may be respectable though i am not so sure of that but his position in life is very humble
he is probably a bootblack a singular person to select for the friend of a girl like florence
there's them that stands higher that isn't half so good retorted jane with more zeal than good grammar
did miss florence take a cab
no she just walked
but she took some clothing with her
she took a handbagthat is all
she will send for her trunk
if you find out where she is living just let me know jane
i will if she is willing to have me answered jane independently
look here jane said curtis angrily don't forget that you are not her servant but my uncle's
it is to him you look for wages not to miss florence
i don't need to be told that sir
i know that well enough
then you know that it is to him that your faithful services are due not to florence
i'm faithful to both mr
waring
you are aware that my uncle is justly displeased with my cousin
i know he's displeased but i am sure he has no good reason to be
curtis waring bit his lips
the girl servant as she was seemed to be openly defying him
his imperious temper could ill brook this
take care
he said with a frown
you seem to be lacking in respect to me
you don't appear to understand my position in this house
oh yes i do
i know you have schemed to get my poor young mistress out of the house and have succeeded
i have a great mind to discharge you girl said curtis with lowering brow
i am not your servant sir
you have nothing to do with me
you will see whether i have or not
i will let you remain for a time as it is your attachment to miss florence that has made you forget yourself
you will find that it is for your interest to treat me respectfully
a feeble step was heard at the door and john linden entered the breakfastroom
his face was sad and he heaved a sigh as he glanced mechanically at the head of the table where florence usually sat
curtis waring sprang to his feet and placing himself at his uncle's side led him to his seat
how do you feel this morning uncle
he asked with feigned solicitude
ill curtis
i didn't sleep well last night
i don't wonder sir
you had much to try you
isis florence here
no sir answered jane promptly
she left the house an hour ago
a look of pain appeared on john linden's pale face
diddid she leave a message for me
he asked slowly
she asked me to bid you goodby for her answered jane quickly
uncle don't let yourself be disturbed now with painful thoughts
eat your breakfast first and then we will speak of florence
john linden ate a very light breakfast
he seemed to have lost his appetite and merely toyed with his food
when he arose from the table curtis supported him to the library
it is very painful to methis conduct of florence's curtis he said as he sank into his armchair
i understand it fully uncle said curtis
when i think of it it makes me very angry with the misguided girl
perhaps i have been too harshtoo stern
you uncle too harsh
why you are the soul of gentleness
florence has shown herself very ungrateful
yet curtis i love that girl
her mother seemed to live again in her
have i not acted cruelly in requiring her to obey me or leave the house
you have acted only for good
you are seeking her happiness
you really think this curtis
i am sure of it
but how will it all end
asked linden bending an anxious look upon his wily nephew
by florence yielding
you are sure of that
yes
listen uncle florence is only capricious like most girls of her age
she foolishly desires to have her own way
it is nothing more serious i can assure you
but she has left the house
that seems to show that she is in earnest
she thinks uncle that by doing so she can bend you to her wishes
she hasn't the slightest idea of any permanent separation
she is merely experimenting upon your weakness
she expects you will recall her in a week at the latest
that is all of it
like most weak men it made mr linden angry to have his strength doubted
you think that
he said
i have no doubt of it
she shall find that i am resolute he said irritably
i will not recall her
bravo uncle
only stick to that and she will yield unconditionally within a fortnight
a little patience and you will carry your point
then all will be smooth sailing
i hope so curtis
your words have cheered me
i will be patient
but i hope i shan't have to wait long
where is the morning paper
i shall have to humor and deceive him thought curtis
i shall have a difficult part to play but i am sure to succeed at last
chapter xi
florence secures employment
for a few days after being installed in her new home florence was like one dazed
she could not settle her mind to any plan of selfsupport
she was too unhappy in her enforced exile from her home and it saddened her to think that the uncle who had always been so kind was permanently estranged from her
though mrs o'keefe was kind and dodger was her faithful friend she could not accustom herself to her poor surroundings
she had not supposed luxury so essential to her happiness
it was worse for her because she had nothing to do but give way to her morbid fancies
this mrs o'keefe was clearsighted enough to see
i am sorry to see you so downcast like my dear young lady she said
how can i help it mrs
o'keefe
returned florence
try not to think of your wicked cousin my dear
it isn't of him that i thinkit is of my uncle
how could he be so cruel and turn against me after years of kindness
it's that wicked curtis that is settin' him against you take my word for it miss florence
shure he must be wakeminded to let such a spalpeen set him against a swate young leddy like you
he is weak in body not in mind mrs o'keefe
you are right in thinking that it is curtis that is the cause of my misfortune
your uncle will come to his right mind some day never fear
and now my dear shall i give you a bit of advice
go on my kind friend
i will promise to consider whatever you say
then you'd better get some kind of work to take up your minda bit of sewin' or writin' or anything that comes to hand
i suppose you wouldn't want to mind my applestand a couple of hours every day
no answered florence
i don't feel equal to that
it would do you no end of good to be out in the open air
it would bring back the roses to your pale cheeks
if you coop yourself up in this dark room you'll fade away and get thin
you are right
i will make an effort and go out
besides i must see about work
here dodger entered the room in his usual breezy way
in his hand he brandished a morning paper
how are you feelin' florence
he asked he had given up saying miss florence at her request
here's an advertisement that'll maybe suit you
show it to me dodger said florence beginning to show some interest
the boy directed her attention to the following advertisement wanteda governess for a girl of twelve
must be a good performer on the piano and able to instruct in french and the usual english branches
terms must be moderate
apply to mrs leighton at w street
there florence what do you say to that
that's better than sewin'
i don't know dodger whether i am competent
you play on the pianner don't you
yes
well enough to teach
i think so but i may not have the gift of teaching
yes you have
haven't you been teachin' me every evenin'
you make everything just as clear as mudno i don't mean that
you just explain so that i can't help understandin'
then said florence i suppose i am at liberty to refer to you
yes you can tell the lady to call at the office of dodger esq any mornin' after sunrise and he'll give her full particulars
florence did not immediately decide to apply for the situation but the more she thought of it the more she felt inclined to do so
the little experience she had had with dodger satisfied her that she should enjoy teaching better than sewing or writing
accordingly an hour later she put on her street dress and went uptown to the address given in the advertisement
no
was a handsome brownstone house not unlike the one in which florence had been accustomed to live
it was a refreshing contrast to the poor tenement in which she lived at present
is mrs leighton at home
inquired florence
yes miss answered the servant respectfully
whom shall i say
i have come to apply for the situation of governess answered florence feeling rather awkward as she made the statement
ah said the servant with a perceptible decline in respect
won't you step in
thank you
well she do dress fine for a governess said nancy to herself
it's likely she'll put on airs
the fact was that florence was dressed according to her past social positionin a costly street attirebut it had never occurred to her that she was too well dressed for a governess
she took her seat in the drawingroom and five minutes later there was a rustling heard and mrs leighton walked into the room
are you the applicant for the position of governess
she asked surveying the elegantly attired young lady seated on the sofa
yes mrs leighton answered florence easily for she felt more at home in a house like this than in the tenement
have you taught before
very little answered florence smiling to herself as she wondered what mrs leighton would say if she could see dodger the only pupil she ever had
however i like teaching and i like children
pardon me but you don't look like a governess miss linden suggested florence filling out the sentence
do governesses have a peculiar look
i mean as to dress
you are more expensively dressed than the average governess can afford
it is only lately that my circumstances required me to support myself
i should not be able to buy such a dress out of my present earnings
i am glad to hear you say that for i do not propose to give a large salary
i do not expect one said florence quietly
you consider yourself competent to instruct in music french and the english branches
oh yes
do you speak french
yes madam
would you favor me with a specimen of your piano playing
there was a piano in the back parlor
florence removed her gloves and taking a seat before it dashed into a spirited selection from strauss
mrs leighton listened with surprised approval
certainly you are a fine performer she said
whatif i should engage youwould you expect in the way of compensation
how much time would you expect me to give
three hours dailyfrom nine to twelve
i hardly know what to say
what did you expect to pay
about fifty cents an hour
florence knew very well from the sums that had been paid for her own education that this was miserably small pay but it was much more than she could earn by sewing
i will teach a month on those terms she said after a pause
mrs leighton looked well pleased
she knew that she was making a great bargain
oh by the way she said can you give references
i can refer you to madam morrison naming the head of a celebrated female seminary
she educated me
that will be quite satisfactory said mrs leighton graciously
can you begin tomorrow
yes madam
you will then see your pupil
at present she is out
florence bowed and withdrew
she had been afraid mrs leighton would inquire where she lived and she would hardly dare to name the humble street which she called home
she walked toward fifth avenue when just as she was turning the corner she met mr percy de brabazon swinging a slender cane and dressed in the extreme of the fashion
miss linden
he exclaimed eagerly
this isawindeed a pleasure
where are you walking this fine morning
may iawhave the pleasure of accompanying you
florence stopped short in deep embarrassment
chapter xii
a friend though a dude
percy de brabazon looked sincerely glad to meet florence and she herself felt some pleasure in meeting one who reminded her of her former life
but it was quite impossible that she should allow him to accompany her to her poor home on the east side
thank you mr de brabazon but my engagements this morning will hardly permit me to accept your escort she said
i suppose that means that you are going shopping but i don't mind it i assure you and i will carry your bundles he added magnanimously
that would never do
what
the fashionable mr de brabazon carrying bundles
you would lose your social status
i don't mind miss florence as long as you give meawan approving smile
i will give it now as i bid you goodmorning
may iawhave the pleasure of calling upon you tomorrow evening miss linden
it is evident that you have not heard that i am no longer residing with my uncle
mr de brabazon looked surprised
no i had not heard
may i askawwhere you are wesiding
with friends answered florence briefly
as you are a friend and will be likely to hear it i may as well mention that my uncle is displeased with me and has practically disowned me
then miss florence said mr de brabazon eagerly won't you acceptawmy heart and hand
my mother will be charmed to receive you and iawwill strive to make you happy
i appreciate your devotion i do indeed mr de brabazon said florence earnestly but i must decline your offer
i will not marry without love
i don't mind that said percy if you'll agree to take a feller you'll learn in time to like him a little
i am wichi know you don't care for thatbut i can give you as good a home as your uncle
if you would give me hopeaw i am afraid i cannot mr de brabazon but if you will allow me to look upon you as a friend i will call upon you if i have need of a friend's services
will you weally
yes there is my hand on it
i ought to tell you that i must now earn my own living and am to give lessons to a young pupil in west street three hours daily
you don't mean to say you are actually poor
said mr de brabazon horrified
yes indeed i am
then won't you let me lend you some money
i've got more than i need i have 'pon my honor
thank you i promise to call upon you if i need it
mr de brabazon looked pleased
would you mind telling me where you are going to teach miss florence
florence hesitated but there was something so sincere and friendly in the young man's mannerdude though he wasthat she consented to grant his request
i am to teach the daughter of mr robert leighton
why miss leighton is my cousin said percy in joyous excitement
indeed
had i known that i would hardly have told you
don't be afwaid
i will be vewy discreet said mr de brabazon
thank you and goodmorning
florence went on her way cheered and encouraged in spite of herself by her success in obtaining employment and by the friendly offers of mr de brabazon
it is wrong to get discouraged she said to herself
after all there are warm hearts in the world
when she entered her humble home she found dodger already there
there was an eagerness in his manner and a light in his eye that seemed to indicate good news
well dodger what is it
i've been waitin' half an hour to see you florence he said
i've got some work for you
what is itsewing on a button or mending a coat
no i mean workin' for money
you can play on the pianner can't you
yes
they want a young lady to play the pianner at a dime museum for nine dollars a week
it's a bully chance
i just told the managerhe's a friend of minethat i had a young lady friend that was a stunnin' player and he wants you to come around and see him
it was a preposterous ideaso florence thoughtthat she should consent to play at such a place but she couldn't expect dodger to look at the matter in the same light so she answered very gently and pleasantly you are very kind dodger to look out for me but i shall not need to accept your friend's offer
i have secured a chance to teach uptown
you have
what'll you get
i am to be employed three hours daily at fifty cents an hour
geewhillikens
that's good
you'd have to work as much as twelve hours at the museum for the same pay
you see therefore that i am provided forthat is if i suit
dodger was a little disappointed
still he could not help admitting that it would be better for florence to teach three hours than to work ten or twelve
as to her having any objection to appearing at a dime museum that never occurred to him
florence had sent for her trunk and it was now in her room
dodger accompanied an expressman to the house and luckily saw jane who arranged everything for him
how's the old gentleman
asked dodger
florence wanted me to ask
he's feeble said jane shaking her head
does he miss florence
that he do
why don't he send for her then to come back
asked dodger bluntly
because curtis waring makes him believe she'll come around and ask forgiveness if he only holds out
i tell you dodger that curtis is a viper
so he is answered dodger who was not quite clear in his mind as to what a viper was
i'd like to step on his necktie
if it wasn't for him my dear young mistress would be back in the house within twentyfour hours
i don't see how the old gentleman can let him turn florence out of the house
he's a snake in the grass dodger
it may be wicked but i just wish something would happen to him
and how is miss florence lookin' poor dear
she's lookin' like a daisy
does she worry much
she did at first but now she's workin' every day and she looks more cheerfullike
miss florence workin'
she that was always brought up like a lady
she's teachin' a little girl three hours a day
well that isn't so bad
said jane relieved
teachin' is genteel
i wish i could see her some day
will you tell her dodger that next sunday is my day out and i'll be in central park up by the menagerie at three o'clock if she'll only take the trouble to be up there
i'll tell her jane and i'm sure she'll be there
a day or two afterward curtis waring asked have you heard from my cousin florence since she went away
yes sir
indeed
where is she staying
she didn't send me word
how then did you hear from her
dodger came with an expressman for her trunk
curtis waring frowned
and you let him have it
he demanded sternly
of course i did
why shouldn't i
you should have asked me
and what business have you with miss florence's trunk i'd like to know
said jane independently
never mind you ought to have asked my permission
i didn't think you'd want to wear any of miss florence's things mr
waring
you are silly and impertinent said curtis biting his lips
did that boy tell you anything about her
only that she wasn't worryin' any for you mr
curtis
curtis glanced angrily at his cousin's devoted friend and then turning on his heel left the room
i'll bring her to terms yet he muttered
no girl of seventeen shall defy me
chapter xiii
tim bolton's saloon
not far from houston street on the west side of the bowery is an underground saloon with whose proprietor we are already acquainted
it was kept by tim bolton whose peculiar tastes and shady characteristics well fitted him for such a business
it was early evening and the gas jets lighted up a characteristic scene
on the sanded floor were set several tables around which were seated a motley company all of them with glasses of beer or whiskey before them
tim with a white apron on was moving about behind the bar ministering to the wants of his patrons
there was a scowl upon his face for he was not fond of work and he missed dodger's assistance
the boy understood the business of mixing drinks as well as he and often officiated for hours at a time thus giving his guardian and reputed father a chance to leave the place and meet outside engagements
a tall erect gentleman entered the saloon and walked up to the bar
goodevening colonel said tim
goodevening sir said the newcomer with a stately inclination of the head
he was really a colonel having served in the civil war at the head of a georgia regiment
he had all the stately courtesy of a southern gentleman though not above the weakness of a frequent indulgence in the strongest fluids dispensed by tim bolton
what'll you have colonel
whiskey straight sir
it's the only drink fit for a gentleman
will you join me mr
bolton
of course i will said tim as pouring out a glass for himself he handed the bottle to the colonel
your health sir said the colonel bowing
same to you colonel responded tim with a nod
where's the boy
col martin had always taken considerable notice of dodger being naturally fond of boys and having once had a son of his own who was killed in a railroad accident when about dodger's age
danged if i know
answered tim crossly
he hasn't left you has he
yes he's cleared out the ungrateful young imp
i'd like to lay my hands on the young rascal
was he your son
he was mystepson answered tim hesitating
i see you married his mother
yes said tim considering the explanation satisfactory and resolved to adopt it
i've always treated him as if he was my own flesh and blood and i've raised him from a young kid
now he's gone and left me
can you think of any reason for his leaving you
not one
i always treated him well
he's been a great expense to me and now he's got old enough to help me he must clear out
he's the most ungrateful cub i ever seen
i am sorry he has gonei used to like to have him serve me
and now what's the consequence
here i am tied down to the bar day and night
can't you get some one in his place
yes but i'd likely be robbed i had a bartender once who robbed me of two or three dollars a day
but you trusted the boy
yes dodger wouldn't steali can say that much for him
there's one thing i noticed about the boy said the colonel reflectively
he wouldn't drink
more than once i have asked him to drink with me but he would always say 'thank you colonel but i don't like whiskey'
i never asked him to take anything else for whiskey's the only drink fit for a gentleman
do you expect to get the boy back
if i could only get out for a day i'd hunt him up but i'm tied down here
i seed him yesterday tim said a rednosed man who had just entered the saloon in company with a friend of the same general appearance
both wore silk hats dented and soiled with stains of dirt coats long since superannuated and wore the general look of barroom loafers
they seldom had any money but lay in wait for any liberal stranger in the hope of securing a free drink
where did you see him hooker
asked tim bolton with sudden interest
selling papers down by the astor house
think of that colonel
said tim disgusted
becomin' a common newsboy when he might be in a genteel employment
did you speak to him hooker
yes i asked him if he had left you
what did he say
that he had left you for goodthat he was going to grow up respectable
think of that
said tim with renewed disgust
did he say where he lived
no
did he ask after me
no except he said that you were no relation of his
he said he expected you stole him when he was a kid and he hoped some time to find his relations
tim bolton's face changed color and he was evidently disturbed
could the boy have heard anything
he wondered for his suspicions were very near the truth
it's all nonsense
he said roughly
next time you see him hooker foller him home and find out where he lives
all right tim
it ought to be worth something he insinuated with a husky cough
that's so
what'll you take
whiskey answered hooker with a look of pleased anticipation
you're a gentleman tim he said as he gulped down the contents of a glass without winking
briggs his dilapidated companion had been looking on in thirsty envy
i'll help hooker to look for dodger he said
very well briggs
couldn't you stand a glass for me too tim
asked briggs eagerly
no answered bolton irritably
i've been at enough expense for that young rascal already
but the colonel noticed the pathetic look of disappointment on the face of briggs and he was stirred to compassion
drink with me sir he said turning to the overjoyed briggs
thank you colonel
you're a gentleman
two glasses tim
so the colonel drained a second glass and briggs pouring out with trembling fingers as much as he dared followed suit
when the last drop was drunk he breathed a deep sigh of measureless enjoyment
if either of you bring that boy in here said tim i'll stand a couple of glasses for both
we're your men tim said hooker
ain't we briggs
that's so hooker
shake
and the poor victims of drink shook hands energetically
long since they had sunk their manhood in the intoxicating cup and henceforth lived only to gratify their unnatural craving for what would sooner or later bring them to a drunkard's grave
as they left the saloon the colonel turned to tim and said i like whiskey sir but i'll be hanged if i can respect such men as those
they're bums colonel that's what they are
how do they live
don't know
they're in here about every day
if it's drink that's brought them where they are i'm half inclined to give it up but after all it isn't necessary to make a beast of yourself
i always drink like a gentleman sir
so you do colonel
at that moment a poor woman in a faded calico dress with a thin shawl over her shoulders descended the steps that led into the saloon and walked up to the bar
has my husband been here tonight
she asked
tim bolton frowned
who's your husband
he asked roughly
wilson
no bill wilson hasn't been here tonight
even if he had you have no business to come after him
i don't want any sniveling women here
i couldn't help it mr bolton said the woman putting her apron to her eyes
if bill comes in won't you tell him to come home
the baby's dead and we haven't a cent in the house
even tim was moved by this
i'll tell him he said
take a drink yourself you don't look strong
it shan't cost you a cent
no said the woman not a drop
it has ruined my happiness and broken up our home
not a drop
here my good lady said the colonel with chivalrous deference you have no money
take this and he handed the astonished woman a fivedollar bill
heaven bless you sir
she exclaimed fervently
allow me to see you to the street and the gallant southern gentleman escorted her up to the sidewalk
i'd like to horsewhip that woman's husband
don't you sell him another drop
he said when he returned
chapter xiv
the missing will
an hour after the depart of the colonel there was an unexpected arrival
a welldressed gentleman descended the stairs gingerly looked about him with fastidious disdain and walked up to the bar
tim bolton was filling an order and did not immediately observe him
when at length he turned around he exclaimed in some surprise mr
waring
yes bolton i have found my way here
i have been expecting you
i came to you for some information
well ask your questions i don't know whether i can answer them
first where is my cousin florence
how should i know
she wasn't likely to place herself under my protection
she's with that boy of yoursdodger i believe you call him
where is he
run away answered bolton briefly
do you mean that you don't know where he is
yes i do mean that
i haven't set my eyes on him since that night
what do you mean by such negligence
do you remember who he is
certainly i do
then why do you let him get of your reach
how could i help it
here i am tied down to this bar day and night
i'm nearly dead for want of sleep
it would be better to close up your place for a week and look after him
couldn't do it
i should lose all my trade
people would say i was closed up
and have you done nothing toward his recovery
yes i have sent out two men in search of him
have you any idea where he is or what he is doing
yes he has been seen in front of the astor house selling papers
i have authorized my agent if he sees him again to follow him home and find out where he lives
that is good
astor house
i may see him myself
but why do you want to see him
do you want to restore him to his rights
hush
said curtis glancing around him apprehensively
what we say may be overheard and excite suspicion
one thing may be secured by finding himthe knowledge of florence's whereabouts
what makes you think she and the boy are together
he came for her trunk
i was away from home or i would not have let it go it is strange that they two are together considering their relationship
that is what i am afraid they will find out
she may tell him of the mysterious disappearance of her cousin and he that reminds me interrupted bolton
he told hookerhooker was the man that saw him in front of the astor housethat he didn't believe i was his father
he said he thought i must have stolen him when he was a young kid
did he say that
asked curtis in evident alarm
yes so hooker says
if he has that idea in his head he may put two and two together and guess that he is the longlost cousin of florence
tim the boy must be got rid of
if you mean what i think you do mr waring i'm not with you
i won't consent to harm the boy
you said that before
i don't mean anything that will shock your tender heart bolton said curtis with a sneer
i mean carried to a distanceeurope or australia for instance
all i want is to keep him out of new york till my uncle is dead
after that i don't care what becomes of him
that's better
i've no objection to that
how is the old gentleman
he grieved so much at first over the girl's loss that i feared he would insist on her being recalled at once
i soothed him by telling him that he had only to remain firm and she would come around and yield to his wishes
do you think she will
asked tim doubtfully
i intend she shall
said curtis significantly
bolton i love the girl all the more for her obstinate refusal to wed me
i have made up my mind to marry her with her consent or without it
i thought it was only the estate you were after
i want the estate and her with it
mark my words bolton i will have both
you will have the estate no doubt mr linden has made his will in your favor has he not
and bolton looked intently in the face of his visitor
hark you bolton there is a mystery i cannot fathom
my uncle made two wills
in the earlier he left the estate to florence and myself if we married otherwise to me alone
that is satisfactory
yes but there was another in which the estate goes to the son if living
that will has disappeared
is it possible
asked bolton in astonishment
when was it missed
on the night of the burglary
then you think that the boy dodger has it
good heavens
if he only knew that by this will the estate goes to him
and waring wiped the perspiration from his brow
you are sure he did not give you the will
he demanded eying bolton sharply
i have not seen him since the night of the robbery
if he has read the will it may lead to dangerous suspicions
he would give it to your cousin florence would he not
perhaps so
bolton you must get the boy back and take the will from him if you can
i will do my best but you must remember that dodger is no longer a small kid
he is a boy of eighteen strong and well grown
he wouldn't be easy to manage
besides as long as he doesn't know that he has any interest in the will his holding it won't do any harm
is the old gentleman likely to live long
i don't know
i sometimes hope pshaw
why should i play the hypocrite when speaking to you
surely it is no sin to wish him better off since he can't enjoy life
he might if florence and his son were restored to him
what do you mean bolton
asked curtis suspiciously
what could i mean
it merely occurred to me said bolton innocently
you say he is quiet thinkin' the girl will come around
yes
suppose time passes and she doesn't
won't he try to find her
as she is in the city that won't be hard
i shall represent that she has left the city
for any particular point
no that is not necessary
and then
if he worries himself into the grave so much the better for me
there is no halfway about you mr curtis waring
why should there be
listen bolton i have set my all on this cast
i am now thirtysix and still i am dependent upon my uncle's bounty
i am in debt and some of my creditors are disposed to trouble me
my uncle is worthi don't know how much but i think half a million
what does he get out of it
food and clothes but not happiness
if it were mine all the avenues of enjoyment would be open to me
that estate i must have
suppose you get it what is there for me
asked bolton
i will see that you are recompensed if you help me to it
will you put that in writing
do you take me for a fool
to put it in writing would be to place me in your power
you can trust me
well perhaps so said tim bolton slowly
at any rate you will have to
well goodnight
i will see you again
in the meantime try to find the boy
tim bolton followed him with his eyes as he left the saloon
what would he say said bolton to himself if he knew that the will he so much wishes to find is in my hands and that i hold him in my power already
chapter xv
the new governess
wish me luck dodger
so i do florence
are you goin' to begin teachin' this mornin'
yes and i hope to produce a favorable impression
it is very important to me to please mrs leighton and my future pupil
i'm sure you'll suit
how nice you look
florence smiled and looked pleased
she had taken pains with her dress and personal appearance and being luckily well provided with handsome dresses had no difficulty in making herself presentable
as she stepped out of the shabby doorway upon the sidewalk no one supposed her to be a tenant but she was generally thought to be a visitor perhaps the agent of some charitable association
perhaps all will not judge me as favorably as you do dodger said florence with a laugh
if you have the headache any day florence i'll take your place
you would look rather young for a tutor dodger and i am afraid you would not be dignified
goodmorning
i shall be back to dinner
i am glad to find you punctual miss linden said mrs leighton as florence was ushered into her presence
this is your pupil my daughter carrie
florence smiled and extended her hand
i hope we will like each other she said
the little girl eyed her with approval
this beautiful young lady was a pleasant surprise to her for never having had a governess she expected to meet a stiff elderly lady of stern aspect
she readily gave her hand to florence and looked relieved
carrie said mrs leighton you may show miss linden the way to the schoolroom
all right mamma and the little girl led the way upstairs to a back room on the third floor
so this is to be our schoolroom is it carrie
said florence
it is a very pleasant room
yes but i should have preferred the front chamber
mamma thought that i might be looking into the street too much
here there is only a back yard and nothing to look at
your mamma seems very judicious said florence smiling
are you fond of study
well i ain't exactly fond but i will do my best
that is all that can be expected
do you know miss linden you don't look at all like i expected
am i to be glad or sorry for that
i thought you would be an old maid stiff and starched like may robinson's governess
i am not married carrie so perhaps you may regard me as an old maid
you'll never be an old maid said carrie confidently
you are too young and pretty
thank you carrie said florence with a little blush
you say that i hope because you are going to like me
i like you already said the little girl impulsively
i've got a cousin that will like you too
a young girl
no of course not
he is a young man
his name is percy de brabazon
it is a funny name isn't it
you see his father was a frenchman
florence was glad that she already knew from percy's own mouth of the relationship as it saved her from showing a degree of surprise that might have betrayed her acquaintance with the young man
what makes you think your cousin would like me carrie
because he always likes pretty girls
he is a masher
that's slang carrie
i am sure your mamma wouldn't approve your using such a word
don't tell her
it just slipped out
but about percyhe wants very much to be married
florence was not surprised to hear this for she had the best reason for knowing it to be true
is he a handsome young man
she asked demurely
he's funny looking
he's awful goodnatured but he isn't the sort of young man i would like concluded carrie with amusing positiveness
i hope you don't let your mind run on such things
you are quite too young
oh i don't think much about it
but percy is a dude
he spends a sight for clothes
he always looks as if he had just come out of a bandbox
is he in any business
no he has an independent fortune so mamma says
he was in europe last year
i think carrie we must give up talking and attend to business
i should have checked you before but i thought a little conversation would help us to get acquainted
now show me your books and i will assign your lessons
don't give me too long lessons please miss linden
i will take care not to task you beyond your strength
i don't want my pupil to grow sick on my hands
i hope you won't be too strict
when may robinson makes two mistakes her governess makes her learn her lessons over again
i will promise not to be too strict
now let me see your books
the rest of the forenoon was devoted to study
florence was not only an excellent scholar but she had the art of imparting knowledge and what is very important she was able in a few luminous words to explain difficulties and make clear what seemed to her pupil obscure
so the time slipped quickly and pleasantly away and it was noon before either she or her pupil realized it
it can't be twelve said carrie surprised
yes it is
we must defer further study till tomorrow
why it is a great deal pleasanter than going to school miss linden
i dreaded studying at home but now i like it
i hope you will continue to carrie
i can say that the time has passed away pleasantly for me
as florence prepared to resume her street dress carrie said oh i forgot
mamma asked me to invite you to stay to lunch with me
i take lunch as soon as school is out at twelve o'clock so i won't detain you long
thank you carrie i will stay with pleasure
i am glad of that for i don't like to sit down to the table alone
mamma is never here at this time
she goes out shopping or making calls so poor i have to sit down to the table alone
it will be ever so much pleasure to have you with me
florence was by no means sorry to accept the invitation
the meals she got at home were by no means luxurious and the manner of serving them was by no means what she enjoyed
mrs o'keefe though a good friend and a kindhearted woman was not a model housekeeper and florence had been made fastidious by her early training
lunch was of course a plain meal but what was furnished was of the best quality and the table service was such as might be expected in a luxurious home
just as florence was rising from the table mrs leighton entered the room in street dress
i am glad you remained to lunch miss linden she said
you will be company for my little girl who is very sociable
carrie i hope you were a good girl and gave miss linden no trouble
ask miss linden mamma said carrie confidently
indeed she did very well said florence
i foresee that we shall get along admirably
i am glad to hear that
she is apt to be indolent
i won't be with miss linden mamma
she makes the studies so interesting
after florence left the house carrie pronounced an eulogium upon her which led mrs leighton to congratulate herself upon having secured a governess who had produced so favorable an impression on her little girl
was you kept after school florence
asked dodger as she entered her humble home
i am afraid you'll find your dinner cold
never mind dodger
i am to take dinneror lunch ratherat the house where i am teaching so hereafter mrs o'keefe need not wait for me
and how do you like your place
it is everything that is pleasant
you wished me good luck dodger and your wish has been granted
i was lucky too florence
i've made a dollar and a quarter this mornin'
not by selling papers surely
not all
a gentleman gave me fifty cents for takin' his valise to the long branch boat
it seems we are both getting rich said florence smiling
chapter xvi
dodger becomes ambitious
ah there dodger
dodger who had been busily and successfully selling evening papers in front of the astor house turned quickly as he heard his name called
his glance rested on two men dressed in soiled white hats and shabby suits who were apparently holding each other up having both been imbibing
he at once recognized hooker and briggs for he had waited upon them too many times in tim's saloon not to recognize them
well he said cautiously what do you want
tim has sent us for you
answered the two in unison
what does he want of me
he wants you to come home
he says he can't get along without you
he will have to get along without me said the boy independently
tell him i'm not goin' back
you're wrong dodger said hooker shaking his head solemnly
ain't he your father
no he ain't
he says he is continued hooker looking puzzled
that don't make it so
he ought to know put in briggs
yes he ought to know
chimed in hooker
no doubt he does but he can't make me believe he's any relation of mine
just go and argy the point with him said hooker coaxingly
it wouldn't do no good
maybe it would
just go back with us that's a good boy
what makes you so anxious about it
asked dodger suspiciously
well said hooker coughing we're tim's friends don't you know
what's he goin' to give you if i go back with you
asked the boy shrewdly
a glass of whiskey
replied hooker and briggs in unison
is that all
maybe he'd make it two
i won't go back with you said dodger after a moment's thought but i don't want you to lose anything by me
here's a dime apiece and you can go and get a drink somewhere else
you're a trump dodger said hooker eagerly holding out his hand
i always liked you dodger said briggs with a similar motion
now don't let tim know you've seen me said the newsboy warningly
we won't
and the interesting pair ambled off in the direction of the bowery
so tim sent them fellers after me
soliloqized dodger
i guess i'll have to change my office or maybe tim himself will be droppin' down on me some mornin'
it'll be harder to get rid of him than of them chumps
so it happened that he used to take down his morning papers to the piers on the north river and take his chance of selling them to passengers from boston and others ports arriving by the fall river boats and others from different points
the advantage of this was that he often got a chance to serve as guide to strangers visiting the city for the first time or as porter to carry their valise or other luggage
being a bright wideawake boy with a pleasant face and manner he found his services considerably in demand and on counting up his money at the end of the week he found much to his encouragement that he had received on an average about a dollar and twentyfive cents per day
that's better than sellin' papers alone thought he
besides tim isn't likely to come across me here
i wonder i didn't think of settin' up for myself before
in the evening he spent an hour and sometimes more pursuing his studies under the direction of florence
at first his attention was given chiefly to improving his reading and spelling for dodger was far from fluent in the first while his style of spelling many words was strikingly original
ain't i stupid florence
he asked one day after spelling a word of three syllables with such ingenious incorrectness as to convulse his young teacher with merriment
not at all dodger
you are making excellent progress but sometimes you are so droll that i can't help laughing
i don't mind that if you think i am really gettin' on
undoubtedly you are
i make a great many mistakes said dodger dubiously
yes you do but you must remember that you have taken lessons only a short time
don't you think you can read a good deal more easily than you did
yes i don't trip up half so often as i did
i'm afraid you'll get tired of teachin' me
no fear of that dodger
as long as i see that you are improving i shall feel encouraged to go on
i wish i knew as much as your other scholar
you will in time if you go on
you mustn't get discouraged
i won't
said dodger stoutly
if a little gal like her can learn i'd ought to be ashamed if i don'ta big boy of eighteen
it isn't the size of the boy that counts dodger
i know that but i ain't goin' to give in and let a little gal get ahead of me
keep to that determination dodger and you will succeed in time never fear
on the whole florence enjoyed both her pupils
she had the faculty of teaching and she became very much interested in both
as for dodger she thought rough diamond as he was that she saw in him the making of a manly man and she felt that it was a privilege to assist in the development of his intellectual nature
again he had picked up a good deal of slang from the nature of his associates and she set to work to improve his language and teach him refinement
it was necessarily a slow process but she began to find after a time that a gradual change was coming over him
i want you to grow up a gentleman dodger she said to him one day
i'm too rough for that florence
i'm only an ignorant street boy
you are not going to be an ignorant street boy all your life
i don't see why you should not grow up a polished gentleman
i shall never be like that de brabazon young man said he
no dodger i don't think you will said florence laughing
i don't want you to become effeminate nor a dude
i think i would like you less than i do now
do you like me florence
asked dodger brightening up
to be sure i do
i hope you don't doubt it
why it don't seem naturallike
you're a fashionable young lady not very fashionable dodger just at present
well a hightoned young ladyone of the tiptops and i am a rough bowery boy
you were once but you are getting over that rapidly
did you ever hear of andy johnson
who was he
he became president of the united states
well at the age of twentyone he could neither read nor write
at twentyone
repeated dodger
why i'm only eighteen and i do know something of readin' and writin'
to be sure
well andy johnson was taught to read and write by his wife
he kept on improving himself till in course of time he became a united states senator vicepresident and afterward president
now i don't expect you to equal him but i see no reason why you should not become a welleducated man if you are content to work and keep on working
i will keep on florence said dodger earnestly
if i ever find my relations i don't want them to be ashamed of me
it was not the first time he had referred to his uncertain origin
won't tim bolton tell you anything about your family
no i've asked him more'n once
he always says he's my father and that makes me mad
it is strange said florence thoughtfully
i had a young cousin stolen many years ago
was it the son of the old gentleman you lived with on madison avenue
yes it was the son of uncle john
it quite broke him down
after my cousin's loss he felt that he had nothing to live for
i wish i was your cousin florence said dodger thoughtfully
well then i will adopt you as my cousin or brother whichever you prefer
i would rather be your cousin
then cousin let it be
now we are bound to each other by strong and near ties
but when your uncle takes you back you'll forget all about poor dodger
no i won't dodger
there's my hand on it
whatever comes we are friends forever
then i'll try not to disgrace you florence
i'll learn as fast as i can and see if i don't grow up to be a gentleman
chapter xvii
a mysterious adventure
several weeks passed without changing in any way the position or employment of dodger or florence
they had settled down to their respective forms of labor and were able not only to pay their modest expenses but to save up something for a rainy day
florence had but one source of regret
she enjoyed her work and did not now lament the luxurious home which she had lost
but she did feel sore at heart that her uncle made no sign of regret for their separation
from him she received no message of forgiveness or reconciliation
he has forgotten me
she said to herself bitterly
he has cast me utterly out of his heart
i do not care for his money but i do not like to think that my kind unclefor he was always kind till the last troublehas steeled his heart against me forever
but she learned through a chance meeting with jane that this was not so
mr linden is getting very nervous and lowspirited said the girl and sits hour after hour in the library looking into the fire afotchin' deep sighs every few minutes
once i saw him with your photographthe one you had taken last springin his hands and he looked sadlike when he laid it down
my dear uncle
then he does think of me sometimes
it's my belief he'd send for you if curtis would let him
surely curtis cannot exercise any restraint upon him
he has frequent talks with the old gentleman
i don't know what he says but it's sure to be something wicked
i expect he does all he can to set him against you
oh he's a cunning villain he is even if he is your cousin miss florence
and do you think my uncle is unhappy jane
said florence thoughtfully
that i do miss
he never was very bright or cheerful you know
but he never was like this
and i do think he's gettin' more and more feeble
do you think i ought to call upon him and risk his sending me away
it might be worth tryin' miss florence
the result of this conversation was that florence did make up her mind the very next afternoon to seek her old home
she had just reached the front steps and was about to ascend when the door opened and curtis appeared
he started at sight of his cousin
florence
he said
tell me why you came here
i am anxious about my uncle she said
tell me curtis how he is
you know he's never in vigorous health said curtis evasively
but is he as well as usual
he is about the same as ever
one thing would do more for him than anything else
what's that
your agreement to marry me and he fixed his eyes upon her face eagerly
florence shook her head
i should be glad to help my uncle she said but i cannot agree to marry you
why not
he demanded roughly
because i do not love you and never shall she responded firmly
in other words you refuse to do the only thing that will restore our uncle to health and happiness
it is too much to ask
then fixing her eyes upon him keenly why should uncle insist upon this marriage
is it not because you have influenced him in the matter
no answered curtis falsely
he has some secret reason which he will not disclose to me for desiring it
florence had learned to distrust the words of her wily cousin
may i not see him
she asked
perhaps he will tell me
no i cannot permit it
you cannot permit it
are you then our uncle's guardian
no and yes
i do not seek to control him but i wish to save him from serious agitation
should he see you and find that you are still rebellious the shock might kill him
i have reason to doubt your words said florence coldly
i think you are resolved to keep us apart
listen and i will tell you a secret uncle john has heart disease so the doctor assures me
any unwonted agitation might kill him instantly
i am sure you would not like to expose him to such a risk
he spoke with apparent sincerity but florence did not feel certain that his words were truthful
very well she said
then i will give up seeing him
it is best unless you are ready to accede to his wishesand mine
she did not answer but walked away slowly
it would never do to have them meet
muttered curtis
the old gentleman would ask her to come back on any terms and then all my scheming would be upset
that was a happy invention of mine about heart disease he continued with a low laugh
though she only half believed it she will not dare to run the risk of giving him a shock
it was about this time that the quiet tenor of dodger's life was interrupted by a startling event
he still continued to visit the piers and one afternoon about six o'clock he stood on the pier awaiting the arrival of the day boat from albany with a small supply of evening papers under his arm
he had sold all but half a dozen when the boat touched the pier
he stood watching the various passengers as they left the boat and turned their steps in different directions when some one touched him on the shoulder
looking up he saw standing at his side a man of slender figure with gray hair and whiskers
boy he said i am a stranger in the city
can i ask your assistance
yes sir certainly answered dodger briskly
do you know where the nearest station of the elevated road is
yes sir
i want to go uptown but i know very little about the city
will you accompany me as guide
i will pay you well
all right sir answered dodger
it was just the job he was seeking
we will have to walk a few blocks unless you want to take a carriage
it isn't necessary
i am strong in spite of my gray hair
and indeed he appeared to be
dodger noticed that he walked with the elastic step of a young man while his face certainly showed no trace of wrinkles
i live in the west said the stranger as they walked along
i have not been here for ten years
then you have never ridden on the elevated road
said dodger
nno answered the stranger with curious hesitation
yet when they reached the station he went up the staircase and purchased his ticket with the air of a man who was thoroughly accustomed to doing it
i suppose you don't want me any longer said dodger preparing to resign the valise he was carrying and which by the way was remarkably light considering the size
yes i shall need you said the other hurriedly
there may be some distance to walk after we get uptown
all right sir
dodger was glad that further service was required for this would of course increase the compensation which he would feel entitled to ask
they entered one of the cars and sat down side by side
the old gentleman drew a paper from his pocket and began to read while dodger left to his own devices sat quiet and looked about him
he was rather surprised that the old gentleman who according to his own representation was riding upon the elevated road for the first time seemed to feel no curiosity on the subject but conducted himself in all respects like an experienced traveler
he's a queer customer
thought dodger
however it's all one to me as long as he pays me well for the job
they got out at one hundred and twentyfifth street and struck down toward the river dodger carrying the valise
i wonder where we're going
he asked himself
at length they reached a wooden house of three stories standing by itself and here the stranger stopped
he rang the bell and the door was opened by a humpbacked negro who looked curiously at dodger
is the room ready julius
asked the old man
yes sir
boy take the valise upstairs and i will follow you
up two flights of stairs walked dodger followed by the old man and the negro
the latter opened the door of a back room and dodger obedient to directions took the valise inside and deposited it on a chair
he had hardly done so when the door closed behind him and he heard the slipping of a bolt
what does all this mean
dodger asked himself in amazement
chapter xviii
in a trap
hold on there
open that door
he exclaimed aloud
there was no answer
i say let me out
continued our hero beginning to kick at the panels
this time there was an answer
stop that kicking boy
i will come back in fifteen minutes and explain all
well thought dodger this is about the strangest thing that ever happened to me
however i can wait fifteen minutes
he sat down on a cane chairthere were two in the roomand looked about him
he was in an ordinary bedroom furnished in the usual manner
there was nothing at all singular in its appearance
on a book shelf were a few books and some old numbers of magazines
there was one window looking into a back yard but as the room was small it was sufficient to light the apartment
dodger looked about in a cursory manner not feeling any particular interest in his surroundings for he had but fifteen minutes to wait but he thought it rather queer that it should be thought necessary to lock him in
he waited impatiently for the time to pass
seventeen minutes had passed when he heard the bolt drawn
fixing his eyes eagerly on the door he saw it open and two persons entered
one was the humpbacked negro carrying on a waiter a plate of buttered bread and a cup of tea the other person wasnot the old man but to dodger's great amazement a person wellremembered though he had only seen him oncecurtis waring
set down the waiter on the table julius said waring
dodger looked on in stupefaction
he was getting more and more bewildered
now you can go
said curtis in a tone of authority
the negro bowed and after he had disposed of the waiter withdrew
do you know me boy
asked curtis turning now and addressing dodger
yes you are mr
waring
you remember where you last saw me
yes sir
at your uncle's house on madison avenue
quite right
how did you come here
where is the old man whose valise i brought from the albany boat
curtis smiled and drew from his pocket a gray wig and whiskers
you understand now don't you
yes sir i understand that i have been got here by a trick
yes answered curtis coolly
i have deemed it wise to use a little stratagem
but you must be hungry
sit down and eat your supper while i am talking to you
dodger was hungry for it was past his usual supper time and he saw no reason why he should not accept the invitation
accordingly he drew his chair up to the table and began to eat
curtis seated himself on the other chair
i have a few questions to ask you and that is why i arranged this interview
we are quite by ourselves he added significantly
very well sir go ahead
where is my cousin florence
i am right i take it in assuming that you know where she is
yes sir i know answered dodger slowly
very well tell me
i don't think she wants you to know
curtis frowned
it is necessary i should know
he said emphatically
i will ask her if i may tell you
i can't wait for that
you must tell me at once
i can't do that
you are mistaken you can do it
then i won't
said dodger looking his companion full in the face
curtis waring darted a wicked look at him and seemed ready to attack the boy who was audacious enough to thwart him but he restrained himself and said let that pass for the present
i have another question to ask
where is the document you took from my uncle's desk on the night of the burglary
and he emphasized the last word
dodger looked surprised
i took no paper he said
do you deny that you opened the desk
asked curtis
no
when i came to examine the contents in the presence of my uncle it was found that a documenthis willhad disappeared and with it a considerable sum of money
and he looked sharply at dodger
i don't know anything about it sir
i took nothing
you can hardly make me believe that
why did you open the desk if you did not propose to take anything
i did intend to take something
i was under orders to do so for i wouldn't have done it of my own free will but the moment i got the desk open i heard a cry and looking around i saw miss florence looking at me
and then
i was startled and ran to her side
and then you went back and completed the robbery
no i didn't
she talked to me so that i felt ashamed of it
i never stole before and i wouldn't have tried to do it then ifif some one hadn't told me to
i know whom you meantim bolton
yes tim bolton since you know
what did he tell you to take
the will and the money
eactly
now we are coming to it
you took them and gave them to him
no i didn't
i haven't seen him since that night
curtis waring regarded the boy thoughtfully
his story was straightforward and it agreed with the story told by tim himself
but on the other hand he denied taking the missing articles and yet they had disappeared
curtis decided that both he and tim had lied and that this story had been concocted between them
probably bolton had the will and the moneythe latter he did not care forand this thought made him uneasy for he knew that tim bolton was an unscrupulous man and quite capable of injuring him if he saw the way clear to do so
my young friend he said your story is not even plausible
the articles are missing and there was no one but yourself and florence who were in a position to take them
do you wish me to think that my cousin florence robbed the desk
no sir i don't
florence wouldn't do such a thing said dodger warmly
florence
is that the way you speak of a young lady
she tells me to call her florence
i used to call her miss florence but she didn't care for it
it seems you two have become very intimate said curtis with a sneer
florence is a good friend to me
i never had so good a friend before
all that is very affecting however it isn't to the point
do you know he continued in a sterner tone that i could have you arrested for entering and breaking open my uncle's desk with burglarious intent
i suppose you could said dodger but florence would testify that i took nothing
am i to understand then that you refuse to give me any information as to the will and the money
no sir i don't refuse
i would tell you if i knew
curtis regarded the boy in some perplexity
he had every appearance of telling the truth
dodger had one of those honest truthful countenances which lend confirmation to any words spoken
if the boy told the truth what could have become of the willand the money
as to the former it might be possible that his uncle had destroyed it but the disappearance of the money presented an independent difficulty
the will is all i care for he said at length
the thief is welcome to the money though there was a considerable sum
i would find the will for you if i could said dodger earnestly
you are positive you didn't give it to bolton
positive sir
i haven't seen tim since that night
you may be speaking the truth or you may not
i will talk with you again tomorrow and curtis arose from his chair
you don't mean to keep me here
said dodger in alarm
i shall be obliged to do so
i won't stay
exclaimed dodger in excitement and he ran to the door meaning to get out but curtis drew a pistol from his pocket and aimed it at the boy
understand me boy he said i am in earnest and i am not to be trifled with
dodger drew back and curtis opened the door and went out bolting it after him
chapter xix
an attempt to escape
while dodger had no discomfort to complain of it occurred to him that florence would be alarmed by his long absence for now it seemed certain that he would have to remain overnight
if only he could escape he would take care not to fall into such a trap again
he went to the window and looked out but the distance to the ground was so greatfor the room was on the third floorthat he did not dare to imperil his life by attempting a descent
if there had been a rope at hand he would not have felt afraid to make the attempt
he examined the bed to see if it rested upon cords but there were slats instead
as has already been said there were no houses near by
that part of the city had not been much settled and it was as solitary as it is in the outskirts of a country village
if he could only reveal his position to some person outside so as to insure interference he might yet obtain his freedom
with this thought he tore a blank leaf from one of the books in the room and hastily penciled the following lines i am kept a prisoner in this house
i was induced to come here by a trick
please get some one to join you and come and demand my release
some weeks before dodger could not have written so creditable a note but he had greatly improved since he had been under the influence and instruction of florence
dodger now posted himself at the window and waited anxiously for some one to pass so that he might attract his attention and throw down the paper
he had to wait for fifteen minutes
then he saw approaching a young man not far from twentyone who looked like a young mechanic returning from his daily work
now was dodger's opportunity
he put his head out of the window and called out hello there
the young man looked and saw him at the window
what do you want
he asked
catch this paper and read what there is on it
he threw down the leaf which after fluttering in the gentle evening breeze found its way to the ground and was picked up
after reading it the young man looked up and said i'll go around to the door and inquire
he was as good as his word
he went to the outer door and rang the bell
julius came to the door
what's wanted boss
he said
you've got a boy locked up in a room
who told you boss
he threw down a paper to me telling me he was kept a prisoner
what did he say
asked julius
the young man read the note aloud
what have to say to that you black imp
he demanded sternly
the ready wit of julius served him in this emergency
dat boy is crazy as a loon boss
he answered readily
we have to keep him shut up for fear he'll kill some of us
you don't say
ejaculated the young mechanic
he don't look like it
no he don't dat's a fact boss
fact is dat boy is the artfullest lunytick you ever seed
he tried to kill his mother last week
is that true
dat's so boss
and all de while he looks as innocent as a baby
if i was to let him out he'd kill somebody sure
i never would have believed it said the young man
if you want to take the risk boss you might go up and see him
i believe he's got a carvin'knife about him but i don't dare to go up and get it away
it would be as much as this niggah's life is worth
no answered the young man hastily
i don't want to see him
i never did like crazy folks
i'm sorry i gave you the trouble to come to the door
oh no trouble boss
i guess i've fixed dat boy
chuckled julius
ho ho
he can't get ahead of old julius
crazy as a loon ho ho
dodger waited anxiously for the young man to get through his interview
he hoped that he would force his way up to the third floor draw the bolt and release him from his imprisonment
he kept watch at the window and when the young man reappeared he looked at him eagerly
did you ask them to let me out
he shouted
the other looked up at him with an odd expression of suspicion and repulsion
you're better off where you are he said rather impatiently
but they have locked me up here
and reason enough too
what makes you say that
because you're crazy as a loon
did the black man say that
inquired dodger indignantly
yes he didsaid you tried to kill your mother and had a carvingknife hidden in the room
it's a liean outrageous lie
exclaimed dodger his eyes flashing
don't go into one of your tantrums said the man rather alarmed it won't do any good
but i want you to understand that i am no more crazy than you are
sho
i know better
where's your carvingknife
i haven't got any i never had any
that negro has been telling you lies
just go to the door again and insist on seeing me
i wouldn't dast to
you'd stab me said the man fearfully
listen to me
said dodger getting out of patience
i'm not crazy
i'm a newsboy and baggagesmasher
an old man got me to bring his valise here and then locked me up
won't you go around to the stationhouse and send a policeman here
i'll see about it said the young man who did not believe a word that dodger had said to him
he won't do it
said dodger to himself in a tone of discouragement
that miserable nigger has made him believe i am a lunatic
i'll have him up anyway
forthwith he began to pound and kick so forcibly that julius came upstairs on a run half inclined to believe that dodger had really become insane
what do you want boy
he inquired from outside the door
i want you to unbolt the door and let me out
i couldn't do it nohow said julius
it would be as much as my place is worth
i will give you a dollarfive dollarsif you will only let me out
the man who brought me here is a bad man who is trying to cheat his cousina young ladyout of a fortune
don't know nothin' 'bout that said julius
he has no right to keep me here
don't know nothin' 'bout that either
i'm actin' accordin' to orders
look here said dodger bethinking himself of what had just happened
did you tell that young man who called here just now that i was crazy
julius burst into a loud guffaw
i expect i did he laughed
said you'd got a long carvin'knife hid in de room
what made you lie so
demanded dodger sternly
couldn't get rid of him no other way
oh how scared he looked when i told him you tried to kill your mother
and the negro burst into another hearty laugh which exasperated dodger exceedingly
how long is mr waring going to keep me here
did he tell you
dodger asked after a pause
no he didn't say
when is he coming here again
said he'd come tomorrow most likely
will you bring me a light
couldn't do it
you'd set the house on fire
it seemed useless to prolong the conversation
dodger threw himself on the bed at an early hour but he did not undress thinking there might possibly be a chance to escape during the night
but the morning came and found him still a prisoner but not in the solitary dwelling
chapter xx
a midnight ride
curtis waring had entrapped dodger for a double purpose
it was not merely that he thought it possible the boy had the will or knew where it was
he had begun to think of the boy's presence in new york as dangerous to his plans
john linden might at any time learn that the son for whose appearance he had grieved so bitterly was still living in the person of this street boy
then there would be an end of his hopes of inheriting the estate
only a few months more and the danger would be over for he felt convinced that his uncle's tenure of life would be brief
the one essential thing then seemed to be to get dodger out of the city
the first step had already been taken what the next was will soon appear
scarcely had dodger failed in his attempt to obtain outside assistance when an unaccountable drowsiness overcame him considerably to his surprise
i don't know what's come to me he said to himself
it can't be more than seven or eight o'clock and yet i feel so sleepy i can hardly keep my eyes open
i haven't worked any harder than usual today and i can't understand it
dodger had reason to be surprised for he didn't usually retire till eleven o'clock
in a city like new york where many of the streets are tolerably well filled even at midnight people get in the way of sitting up much later than in the country and dodger was no exception to this rule
yet here he was ready to drop off to sleep before eight o'clock
to him it was a mystery for he did not know that the cup of tea which he had drunk at supper had been drugged by direction of curtis waring with an ulterior purpose which will soon appear
i may as well lie down as there is nothing else to do thought dodger
there isn't much fun sitting in the dark
if i can sleep so much the better
five minutes had scarcely passed after his head struck the pillow when our hero was fast asleep
at eleven o'clock a hack stopped in front of the house and curtis waring descended from it
stay here he said to the driver
there will be another passenger
if you are detained i will make it right when i come to pay you
all right sir said the hackman
i don't care how long it is if i am paid for my time
curtis opened the door with a passkey and found julius dozing in a chair in the hall
wake up you sleepyhead he said
has anything happened since i left here
yes sir the boy tried to get away
did he
i don't see how he could do that
you kept the door bolted didn't you
yes sir but he throwed a piece of paper out'n de window sayin' he was kep' a prisoner here
a young man picked it up and came to de house to ax about it
curtis looked alarmed
what did you say
he inquired apprehensively
told him de boy was crazy as a loondat he tried to kill his mother las' week and had a carvin'knife hid in his room
good julius
i didn't give you credit for such a fertile imagination
what's dat massa
asked julius looking puzzled
i didn't know you were such a skillful liar
yah
yah
laughed julius quite comprehending this compliment
i reckon i can twis' de trufe pretty well massa curtis
you have done well julius said curtis approvingly
here's a dollar
the negro was quite effusive in his gratitude
what did the young man say
he looked scared
i tol' him he could go up and see de boy if he wasn't afeared of the carvin'knife but he said he guessed he wouldn'the didn't like crazy folks
curtis laughed heartily
so it all ended as it should
did the boy make any more trouble
yes he pounded and kicked till i had to go up and see what was the matter
i didn't give him no satisfaction and i guess he went to bed
he ought to be in a deep sleep by this time
i will go up and see
go up with me julius for i may have to ask you to help me bring him down
though julius was naturally a coward he felt quite brave when he had company and he at once went upstairs with curtis waring
curtis drew the bolt and entering the chamber his glance fell upon dodger fast asleep on the bed
i am glad the boy did not undress he said
it will save me a great deal of trouble
now julius you can take his feet and i will lift his head and we will take him downstairs
s'pos'n he wakes up massa curtis
he won't wake up
i took care the sleeping potion should be strong enough to produce profound slumber for eighteen hours
seems as if he was dead said julius nervously
tush you fool
he's no more dead than you or i
the hackman looked curious when the two men appeared with their sleeping burden and curtis felt that some explanation was required
the boy has a very painful disease he said and the doctor gave him a sleeping draught
he is going abroad for his health and under the circumstances i think it best not to wake him up
drive slowly and carefully to pier no
as i don't want the boy aroused if it can be helped
all right sir
julius you may lock the door and come with me
i shall need your help to get him on board the ship
all right massa curtis
and mind you don't go to sleep in the carriage you black rascal
added curtis as he saw that the negro found it hard to keep his eyes open
all right massa i'll keep awake
how am i to get home
i will instruct the hackman to take you home
yah yah i'll be ridin' like a gentleman
the journey was successfully accomplished but it took an hour for according to directions the hackman did not force his pace but drove slowly till he reached the north river pier indicated
at the pier was a large stanch vesselthe columbiabound for san francisco around cape horn
all was dark but the second officer was pacing the deck
curtis waring hailed him
what time do you get off
early tomorrow morning
so the captain told me
i have brought you a passenger
the captain told me about him
is his stateroom ready
yes sir
you are rather late
true and the boy is asleep as you will see
he is going to make the voyage for his health and as he has been suffering some pain i thought i would not wake him up
who will direct me to his stateroom
the mate summoned the steward and dodger still unconscious was brought on board and quietly transferred to the bunk that had been prepared for him
it was a critical moment for poor dodger but he was quite unconscious of it
what is the boy's name
asked the mate
arthur grant
the captain has it on his list
is he on board
yes but he is asleep
i do not need to see him
i have transacted all necessary business with himand paid the passage money
julius bring the valise
julius did so
this contains the boy's clothing
take it to the stateroom julius
all right massa curtis
what is your usual time between new york and san francisco
asked curtis addressing the mate
from four to six months
four months is very short six months very long
we ought to get there in five months or perhaps a little sooner with average weather
very well
i believe there is no more to be said
goodnight
goodnight sir
so he is well out of the way for five months
soliloquized curtis
in five months much may happen
before that time i hope to be in possession of my uncle's property
then i can snap my fingers at fate
chapter xxi
a seasick passenger
the good ship columbia had got fifty miles under way before dodger opened his eyes
he looked about him languidly at first but this feeling was succeeded by the wildest amazement as his eyes took in his unusual surroundings
he had gone to sleep on a bedhe found himself on awakening in a ship's bunk
he half arose in his birth but the motion of the vessel and a slight feeling of dizziness compelled him to resume a recumbent position
i must be dreaming thought dodger
it's very queer
i am dreaming i am at sea
i suppose that explains it
he listened and heard the swish of the waters as they beat against the sides of the vessel
he noted the pitching of the ship and there was an unsteady feeling in his head such as those who have gone to sea will readily recall
dodger became more and more bewildered
if it's a dream it's the most real dream i ever had he said to himself
this seems like a ship's cabin he continued looking about him
i think if i got up i should be seasick
i wonder if people ever get seasick in dreams
there was another pitch and dodger instinctively clung to the edge of his berth to save himself from being thrown out
let me see he said trying to collect his scattered recollection
i went to sleep in a house uptowna house to which curtis waring lured me and then made me a prisoner
the house was somewhere near one hundred and twentyfifth street
now it seems as if i was on board a ship
how could i get here
i wish somebody would come in that i could ask
as no one came in dodger got out of the berth and tried to stand on the cabin floor
but before he knew it he was staggering like one intoxicated and his head began to feel bad partly no doubt on account of the sleeping potion which he had unconsciously taken
at this moment the steward entered the cabin
hello young man
have you got up
he asked
where am i
asked dodger looking at him with a dazed expression
where are you
you're on the good ship columbia to be sure
are we out to sea
of course you are
how far from land
well about fifty miles more or less i should judge
how long have i been here
it seems to me you have a poor memory
you came on board last evening
i suppose curtis waring brought me said dodger beginning to get his bearings
there was a gentleman came with youso the mate told me
i don't know his name
where is the ship bound
to san francisco around cape horn
i supposed you knew that
i never heard of the ship columbia before and i never had any idea of making a sea voyage
the steward looked surprised
i suppose your guardian arranged about that
didn't he tell you
i have no guardian
well you'll have to ask capt
barnes about that
i know nothing except that you are a passenger and that your fare has been paid
my fare paid to san francisco
asked dodger more and more at sea both mentally and physically
yes we don't take any deadheads on the columbia
can you tell me what time it is
about twelve o'clock
do you feel hungry
nnot very returned dodger as a ghastly expression came over his face and he tumbled back into his berth looking very pale
the steward smiled
i see how it is he said you are getting initiated
what's that
muttered dodger feebly
you're going to be seasick
you'll hardly be able to appear at the dinner table
it makes me sick to think of eating said dodger feebly
as he sank back into his berth all thoughts of his unexpected position gave way to an overpowering feeling of seasickness
he had never been tried in this way before and he found the sensation far from agreeable
if only the vessel would stop pitching he groaned
oh how happy i should be if i were on dry land
but the vessel wouldn't stopeven for a minute
the motion on the other hand seemed to increase as was natural for they were getting farther and farther from land and were exposed to the more violent winds that swept the open ocean
there is something about seasickness that swallows up and draws away all minor cares and anxieties and dodger was too much affected to consider how or why it was that he so unexpectedly found himself a passenger to california
lie flat on your back said the steward
you will feel better if you do
how long is it going to last
groaned dodger feeling quite miserable
oh you'll feel better tomorrow
i'll bring you some porridge presently
you can get that down and it is better to have something on your stomach
he was right
the next day dodger felt considerably better and ventured to go upon deck
he looked about him in surprise
there had been a storm and the waves were white with foam
as far as the eye could see there was a tumult and an uproar
the ship was tossed about like a cockle shell
but the sailors went about their work unruffled
it was no new sight for them
though his head did not feel exactly right the strong wind entered dodger's lungs and he felt exhilarated
his eyes brightened and he began to share in the excitement of the scene
pacing the deck was a stout bronzed seaman whose dress made it clear even to the inexperienced eyes of dodger that he was the captain
goodmorning master grant he said pleasantly
are you getting your sea legs on
the name was unfamiliar to dodger but he could see that the remark was addressed to him
yes sir he answered
ever been to sea before
no sir
you'll get used to it
bless me you'll stand it like an old sailor before we get to 'frisco
is it a long voyage captain
asked dodger
five months probably
we may get there a little sooner
it depends on the winds and weather
five months said dodger to himself in a tone of dismay
the captain laughed
it'll be a grand experience for a lad like you arthur
said the captain encouragingly
arthur
so his name was arthur
he had just been called master grant so arthur grant was his name on board ship
dodger was rather glad to have a name provided for he had only been known as dodger heretofore and this name would excite surprise
he had recently felt the need of a name and didn't see why this wouldn't answer his purpose as well as any other
i must write it down so as not to forget it he resolved
it would seem queer if i forgot my own name
i shouldn't enjoy it much if i were going to be seasick all the time he answered
oh a strong healthy boy like you will soon be all right
you don't look like an invalid
i never was sick in my life
but your guardian told me he was sending you on a sea voyage for your health
did mr waring say that
yes didn't you know the object of your sea trip
asked capt
barnes in surprise
no
there may be some tendency to disease in your systemsome hereditary tendency said the captain after a pause
were your parents healthy
theydied young answered dodger hesitatingly
that accounts for your guardian's anxiety
however you look strong enough in all conscience and if you're not healthy you will be before the voyage ends
i don't know what i am to do for clothes said dodger as a new source of perplexity presented itself
i can't get along with one shirt and collar for five months
you will find plenty of clothes in your valise
hasn't it been given you
no sir
you may ask the steward for it
you didn't think your guardian would send you on a fivemonths' voyage without a change of clothing did you
and the captain laughed heartily
i don't know mr waring very well said dodger awkwardly
as he went downstairs to inquire about his valise this question haunted him why did curtis waring send him on a sea voyage
chapter xxii
the other passenger
dodger sought the steward and asked for his valise
isn't it in your stateroom
asked that functionary
i haven't seen it
i remember now
it was put with the luggage of the other passenger
i will show it to you
he took dodger to a part of the ship where freight was stored and pointed to a sizable valise with a card attached to it on which was inscribed the name arthur grant
this must be yours he said
yes i suppose so answered dodger glad to have found out the new name which had been given him otherwise he would have supposed the valise belonged to some other person
he took the valise to his stateroom and finding a key tied to the handles he opened it at once
it proved to contain a very fair supply of underclothing socks handkerchiefs etc with a tooth brush a hair brush and comb and a sponge
never in his life had dodger been so well supplied with clothing before
there were four white shirts two tennis shirts half a dozen handkerchiefs and the same number of socks with three changes of underclothing
i begin to feel like a gentleman said dodger to himself complacently
that was not all
at the bottom of the valise was an envelope sealed on which was inscribed the name dodger
that is for me at any rate thought our hero
i suppose it is from curtis waring
he opened the envelope and found inclosed twentyfive dollars in bills with a few lines written on a halfsheet of paper
these dodger read with interest and curiosity
they were as follows dodgerthe money inclosed is for you
when you reach california you will find it of use
i have sent you out there because you will find in a new country a better chance to rise than in the city of new york
i advise you to stay there and grow up with the country
in new york you were under the influence of a bad man from whom it is best that you should be permanently separated
i know something of the early history of tim bolton
he was detected in a crime and fled to escape the consequences
you are not his son but his nephew
your mother was his sister but quite superior to himself
your right name is arthur grant and it will be well for you to assume it hereafter
i have entered you in the list of passengers under that name
i thought you had taken the will from my uncle's desk but i am inclined to think you had nothing to do with it
if you know where it is or whether bolton has it i expect you to notify me in return for the money i have expended in your behalf
in that case you can write to me no
madison avenue
curtis waring
dodger read the letter over twice and it puzzled him
he seems from the letter to take an interest in me he soliloquized
at any rate he has given me money and clothes and paid my passage to california
what for i wonder
i don't believe it is to get me away from the bad influence of tim
there must be some other reason
there was another part of the letter with which dodger did not agree
curtis asserted positively that he was the nephew of tim bolton while he was positive that there was no relationship between them
in that case curtis must have been an early acquaintance of tim's
at any rate he seemed to know about his past life
dodger now comprehended his present situation fully
he was a passenger on the ship columbia and there was no chance of leaving it
he had ascertainel on inquiry that the vessel would not put in anywhere but would make the long voyage direct
it would be over four months at any rate before he could communicate with florence and in the meantime she and mrs o'keefe whom he recognized as a good friend would conclude that he was dead
it was very provoking to think that he could not even telegraph as that would relieve all anxiety and he felt sure that florence was enough his friend to feel anxious about him
he had just closed up his valise when a young man of dark complexion and of an attractive intellectual expression entered the cabin
he nodded pleasantly to dodger and said i suppose this is arthur grant
yes sir answered dodger for he had decided to adopt the name
we ought to become close friends for we are i believe the only passengers
then you are a passenger too
said dodger deciding after a brief scrutiny that he should like his new acquaintance
yes
my name is randolph leslie
i have been for the last five years a reporter on leading new york daily papers and worked so closely that my health has become somewhat affected
my doctor recommended a sea voyage and i have arranged for a pretty long one
what papers have you worked for
oh all the leading onestribune world herald and sun sometimes one and sometimes another
your reason for taking this trip can hardly be the same as mine
you don't look as if your health required you to travel
no answered dodger smiling but i understand that the gentleman who engaged my passage said i was going to sea for my health
if i were as robust as you i shouldn't give much thought to my health
do you intend to remain in california
i don't know what i do intend replied dodger
i didn't know i was going to california at all until i woke up in my stateroom
the young man looked surprised
didn't you know the destination of the vessel when you came on board
he asked
i was brought aboard in my sleep
this is curious
it looks to me as if you had a story to tell
of course i don't want to be curious but if there is anyway in which i can help you by advice or in any other way i am quite ready to do so
dodger paused but only briefly
this young man looked friendly and might help him to penetrate the mystery which at present baffled him
at any rate his experience qualified him to give friendly advice and of this dodger felt that he stood in need
i ought to tell you to begin with he said that i am a poor boy and made my living as best i could by carrying baggage selling papers etc
i don't think any the worse of you for that
did you live at the lodging houses
no until lately i lived with a man who keeps a saloon on the bowery and tended bar for him
what was his name
as a reporter i know the bowery pretty well
tim bolton
tim bolton
i know his place well
i think i must have seen you there
your face looked familiar to me as soon as i set eyes on you
very likely
a good many people came into tim's
i couldn't pretend to remember them all
was tim a relative of yours
i don't believe he was
i always thought that he got hold of me when i was a kid
i don't remember the time when i wasn't with him
i suppose you have always lived in new york
no i lived for several years in australia
tim was in the same business there
i came on with him a year or more since
do you think you ever lived in new york before
yes tim has told me that i was born in new york
i understand that you have left tim now
yes
why may i ask
because i didn't like the business he was in
but i liked it better than the one he wanted me to go into
what was that
burglary
the young reporter started in surprise
well he said this is a new tack for tim
however i never looked upon him as a man who would shrink from any violation of the laws except murder
i don't think he would do that
no tim isn't quite so bad
he isn't the worst man alive though he is a rather hard customer
it was his wanting me to enter a house on madison avenue and open a desk that led to me going on this trip
tell me about it if you don't mind
thus invited dodger told his story to randolph leslie keeping nothing back
he finished by showing him the letter he had found in the valise
chapter xxiii
through the golden gate
well this is certainly a remarkable letter said the reporter as he handed it back to dodger
i am at a loss to understand the interest which this man appears to feel in you
i look upon him as my enemy said dodger
but an enemy doesn't spend so much money upon another as he has
unless he has object in it amended leslie shrewdly
do you know of any connection this man has with you
no i never heard of him until i entered his house and dodger flushed as he thought that his entrance into the mansion on madison avenue had been as a burglar
it seems to me that he knows more about you than you do about him
it also seems to me that he is anxious to get you out of new york the farther the better
but what harm could i do him in new york
asked dodger puzzled
that is the question which i cannot answer
you say he was instrumental in getting his cousin florence out of the house
yes he wanted to marry her
and she would not consent
no i think she hates him
how old is she
seventeen
and he
he looks about thirtyfive
the difference in years isn't great enough to constitute an obstacle provided she loved him
i am thirty years old
i am sure florence would prefer you to curtis waring
don't flatter me
i am vain enough already
the time may come when i may ask your good offices with miss linden
what i was about to ask was is miss linden also entitled to a share in her uncle's estate
she is just as nearly related to him as mr
waring
then i can understand his wishing to get rid of her
i don't know why he should want to send you to a distance
i suppose there can't be any relationship
is it likely that ia poor street boyshould be related to a rich man like mr
linden
it doesn't seem likely i admit said leslie musingly
well i suppose he continued after a pause there is no use in speculating about the matter now
the important point is what are we to do with ourselves during the four or five months we must spend on shipboard
i don't know what i can do said dodger
i can't sell papers and i can't smash baggage
and there appears to be no need of your doing either as you are provided with board and lodging till we reach shore
that seems strange to me for i've always had to hustle for a living
i was about to make a proposal to you
but first let me ask you about your education
i suppose you are not an accomplished scholar
i'm about as ignorant as they make 'em answered dodger drolly
tim was afraid to send me to college for fear i'd get to know too much for my business
tending bar does not require an acquaintance with latin and greek
would you like to know more
i wish i did
florence was teaching me nights when i was in new york
now i've got to give up all that
not necessarily
listen to me arthur
before i came to new york to go into journalism i taught school for two years and i believe i may say that i was tolerably successful
suppose i take you as a scholar
i should like it very much mr leslie but i'm afraid i haven't got money enough to pay you
that is true
you will need all the money you have when you land in california
twentyfive dollars won't go farstill you have all the money that is necessary for i do not intend to charge you anything
you are very kind to me mr leslie considerin' you don't know me said dodger gratefully
on the contrary i think i know you very well
but about the kindness my motives are somewhat mixed
i should like to do you a service but i should also like to find employment for myself that will make the days less monotonous
i have a collection of books in my trunk enough for our needs and if you will agree we will commence our studies tomorrow
i should like it very much
i'd like to show florence when i see her that i have improved
till i saw her i didn't care much but when i talk with her i feel awfully ignorant
in four months a great deal can be accomplished
i don't know how quick you are to learn
after we have had one or two lessons i can judge better
two days later mr leslie pronounced his opinion and a favorable one
you have not exaggerated your ignorance he said to dodger
you have a great deal to learn but on the other hand you are quick have a retentive memory and are very anxious to learn
i shall make something of you
i learn faster with you than with florence said dodger
probably she would succeed better with girls but i hold that a male teacher is better for boys
how long are you willing to study every day
as long as you think best
then we will say from two to three hours
i think you have talent for arithmetic
i don't expect to make you fit for a bookkeeper but i hope to make you equal to most office boys by the time we reach san francisco
what do you intend to do in california
i don't know
i should like to go back to new york but i shall not have money enough
no twentyfive dollars would go but a little way toward the passage
evidently mr waring did not intend to have you return or he would have provided you with more
that is just why i should like to go back
i am afraid he will do some harm to florence
and you would like to be on hand to protect her
yes
randolph leslie smiled
you seem to take a great deal of interest in florence if i may make as free with her name as you do
yes i do mr
leslie
if you were only a little older i might suspect the nature of that interest
i am older than she is
in years yes
but a young lady of seventeen brought up as she has been is older by years than a boy of eighteen
i don't think you need apprehend any harm to miss linden except that mr waring may cheat her out of her rightful share of the inheritance
is her uncle in good health
no sir he is a very feeble man
is he an old man
not so very old
i don't believe he is over sixty
really mr linden was but fiftyfour but being a confirmed invalid he looked older
should you say that he was likely to live very long
no answered dodger
he looks as if you could knock him over with a feather
besides i've heard florence say that she was afraid her uncle could not live long
probably curtis waring is counting upon this
if he can keep florence and her uncle apart for a few months mr linden will die and he will inherit the whole estate
what is this will he speaks of in the letter you showed me
i don't know sir
whatever the provisions are it is evident that he thinks it important to get it into his possession
if favorable to him he will keep it carefully
if unfavorable i think a man like him would not hesitate to suppress it
no doubt you are right sir
i don't know much about wills said dodger
no i suppose not
you never made any i suppose remarked the reporter with a smile
i never had nothing to leave said dodger
anything would be a better expression
as your tutor i feel it incumbent upon me to correct your grammar
i wish you would mr leslie
what do you mean to do when you get to san francisco
i shall seek employment on one of the san farncisco daily papers
six months or a year so spent will restore my health and enable me to live without drawing upon my moderate savings
i expect i shall have to work too to get money to take me back to new york
and now we must ask the reader to imagine four months and one week passed
there had been favorable weather on the whole and the voyage was unusually short
dodger and the reporter stood on deck and with eager interest watched the passage through the golden gate
a little later and the queen city of the pacific came in sight crowning the hill on which a part of the city is built with the vast palace hotel a conspicuous object in the foreground
chapter xxiv
florence in suspense
we must now return to new york to dodger's old home
when he did not return at the usual hour neither florence nor mrs o'keefe was particularly disturbed
it was thought that he had gone on some errand of unusual length and would return an hour or two late
eight o'clock came the hour at which the boy was accustomed to repair to florence's room to study and still he didn't make his appearance
dodger's late this evening mrs o'keefe said florence going up to the room of her landlady
shure he is
it's likely he's gone to brooklyn or up to harlem wid a bundle
he'll be comin' in soon
i hope he will be well paid for the errand since it keeps him so long
i hope so too florence for he's a good boy is dodger
did i tell you how he served the rapscallion that tried to stale my apples the other day
no i would like to hear it
a big blackbearded man came along and asked me for an apple
'you can have one for two pennies' says i
'but i haven't got them' says he
'then you must go widout it' says i
'we'll see about that' says he
and what do you thinkthe fellow picked out one of my biggest apples and was walkin' away
that made me mad
'come back you thafe of the worruld'
says i
'silence you old hag'
says he
actilly he called me an old hag
i wanted to go after him but there was two hoodlums hangin' round and i knew they'd carry off some of my apples when just as i was at my wits' end dodger came round the corner
'dodger' i screamed 'go after that man
he's taken one of my apples widout lave or license'
upon that dodger brave as a lion walked up to the man and says he 'give back that apple or pay for it'
'what's that to you you impudent young rascal'
says the man raisin' the apple to his mouth
but he didn't get a chance to bite it for dodger with a flip of his hand knocked it on the sidewalk and picked it up
wasn't the man mad just
'i'll smash you boy' he growled
'i'm a baggagesmasher myself' says dodger 'and i can smash as well as you'
wid that the man up with his fist and struck at dodger but he dodged the blow and gave him one for himself wid his right
just then up came a cop
'what's all this'
says he
'that man tried to run off wid one of my apples' says i
'come along' says the cop
'you're wanted at the stationhouse'
'it's a lie' says the man
'i paid the woman for the apple and that young rascal knocked it out of my hand'
'i know the boy' says the cop 'and he ain't one of that kind
i'll let you go if you buy five apples from the lady and pay for 'em'
the man made up an ugly face but he didn't want to be locked up and so he paid me a dime for five apples
dodger is very brave said florence
sometimes i think he is too daring
he is liable to get into trouble
if he does he'll get himself out of it never you fear
dodger can take care of himself
nine o'clock came and florence became alarmed
she had not been aware how much she had depended upon the company of her faithful friend humble as his station was
again she went into mrs o'keefe's room
the applewoman had been out to buy some groceries and had just returned
i am getting anxious about dodger said florence
it is nine o'clock
and what's nine o'clock for a boy like him
shure he's used to bein' out at all hours of the night
i shall feel relieved when he comes home
what should i do without him
shure i'd miss him myself but it isn't the first time he has been out late
perhaps that terrible tim bolton has got hold of him suggested florence
tim isn't so bad florence
he isn't fit company for the likes of you but there's worse men nor tim
didn't he send out dodger to commit a burglary
and if he hadn't you'd never made dodger's acquaintance
that's true but it doesn't make burglary any more excusable
don't you really think tim bolton has got hold of him
if he has he won't keep him long i'll make oath of that
he might keep him over night but dodger would come back in the morning
florence was somewhat cheered by mrs o'keefe's refusal to believe that dodger was in any serious trouble but she could not wholly free herself from uneasiness
when eleven o'clock came she went to bed very unwillingly and got very little rest during the night
morning came and still dodger did not show up
as we know he was fairly started on his long voyage though he had not yet recovered consciousness
florence took a very light breakfast and at the usual time went to mrs leighton's to meet her pupil
when the study hour was over she did not remain to lunch but hurried back stopping at mrs o'keefe's applestand just as that lady was preparing to go home to prepare dinner
have you seen anything of dodger mrs
o'keefe
asked florence breathlessly
no i haven't florence
i've had my eye out watchin' for him and he hasn't showed up
is there anything we can do
asked florence anxiously
well we might go around and see timand find out whether he's got hold of him
let us go at once
shure i didn't know you cared so much for the boy said mrs o'keefe with a shrewd look at florence's anxious face
why shouldn't i care for him
he is my only friend
is he now
and what's the matter wid bridget o'keefe
asked the applewoman
excuse me mrs o'keefe
i know very well you are my friend and a kind friend too
i should not have forgotten you
it's all right florence
you're flustrated like and that's why you forget me
i have so few friends that i can't spare one continued florence
that's so
come along wid me and we'll see what tim has to tell us
a short walk brought the two strangely assorted companions to the entrance of tim bolton's saloon
i'm afraid to go in mrs o'keefe said florence
come along wid me my dear i won't let anything harm you
you ain't used to such a place but i've been here more than once to fill the growler
be careful as you go down the steps florence
tim bolton was standing behind the bar and as he heard steps he looked carelessly toward the entrance but when he saw florence his indifference vanished
he came from behind the bar and advanced to meet her
miss linden he said
florence shrank back and clung to her companion's arm
is there anything i can do for you
i am a rough man but i'm not so bad as you may think
that's what i told her tim said mrs o'keefe
i told florence there was worse men than you
thank you mrs o'keefe
can i offer you a glass of whiskey
the applewoman was about to accept but she felt an alarmed tug at her arm and saw that florence would be placed in an embarrassing position if she accepted
so by an exercise of selfdenialfor mrs o'keefe was by no means insensible to the attractions of whiskey though she never drank to excessshe said thank you kindly mr bolton
i won't take any just now but i'll remind you of your offer another day
have it your own way mrs o'keefe
and now what can i do for you and miss linden
oh mr bolton broke in florence unable to bear the suspense longer where is dodger
chapter xxv
finding the clew
tim bolton looked at florence in undisguised astonishment
dodger
he repeated
how should i know
i supposed that you had lured him away from me
he didn't like the business you were in
he preferred to make a living in some other way
then why do you ask me where he is
because he did not come home last night
shure he rooms at my house put in mrs o'keefe and he hasn't showed up since and you thought i might have got hold of him
said bolton inquiringly
then you are mistaken
i haven't seen the boy for weeks
tim bolton spoke so straightforwardly that there was no chance to doubt his word
when he was living with you mr bolton continued florence did he ever stay away like this
no answered bolton
dodger was always very regular about comin' home
then something must have happened to him said florence anxiously
he might have got run in suggested the applewoman
some of them cops is mighty officious
dodger would never do anything to deserve arrest florence said quickly
thrue for you florence but some innersent parties are nabbed
i know of one young man who was standin' on a strate corner waitin' for the cars when a cop came up and arristed him for disorderly conduct
but that is shameful
said florence indignantly
thrue for you my dear
we might go round to the police headquarters and inquire if the boy's been run in
what do you think mr
bolton
asked florence
tim bolton seemed busy thinking
finally he brought down his hand forcibly on the bar and said i begin to see through it
florence did not speak but she fixed an eager look of inquiry on the face of the saloonkeeper
i believe curtis waring is at the bottom of this he said
my cousin
exclaimed florence in astonishment
yes your cousin miss linden
but what can he have against poor dodger
is it because the boy has taken my part and is a friend to me
he wouldn't like him any better on account of that but he has another and a more powerful reason
would you mind telling me what it is
i cannot conceive what it can be
at present answered bolton cautiously i prefer to say nothing on the subject
i will only say the boy's disappearance interferes with my plans and i will see if i can't find out what has become of him
if you only will mr bolton i shall be so grateful
i am afraid i have misjudged you
i thought you were an enemy of dodger's
then you were mistaken
i have had the boy with me since he was a kid and though i've been rough with him at times maybe i like him and i may some time have a chance to show him that old tim bolton is one of his best friends
i will believe it now mr bolton said florence impulsively holding out her hand to the burly saloonkeeper
he was surprised but it was evident that he was pleased also and he took the little hand respectfully in his own ample palm and pressed it in a friendly manner
there's one thing more i want you to believe miss linden he said and that is that i am your friend also
thank you mr bolton
and now let us all work together to find dodger
you can count on me miss linden
if you'll tell me where you live i'll send or bring you any news i may hear
i live with mrs o'keefe my good friend here
i haven't my kyard with me tim said the applewoman but i'll give you my strate and number
you know my place of business
yes
if you come to me there i'll let florence know whatever you tell me
she is not always at home
the two went away relieved in mind for helpless and bewildered as they were they felt that tim bolton would make a valuable ally
when they had gone tim turned to hooker and briggs who were lounging at a table waiting for some generous customer to invite them to the bar
boys said tim has either of you seen anything of dodger lately
no answered the two in unison
have you heard anything of him
i heard that he was baggagesmashin' down by the steamboat landings said hooker
go down there both of you and see if you can see or hear anything of him
all right tim
and the two left the saloon and took a westerly route toward the north river piers
three hours later they returned
have you heard anything
asked bolton
did you see dodger
no we didn't see him
but you heard something
yes we found a boy a friend of his that said the last he saw of dodger was last evenin'
where did he see him
near the pier of the albany boats
what was he doin'
carryin' a valise for a man
what kind of a man
how did he look
he had gray hair and gray whiskers
tim was puzzled by the description
if as he suspected curtis were concerned in the abduction this man could not have been he
the man was a passenger by the albany boat i suppose
no that was what looked queer
before the albany boat came in the man was lyin' round with his valise and the boy thought he was goin' off somewhere
but when the boat came in he just mixed in with the passengers and came up to the entrance of the pier
two boys asked to carry his valise but he shook his head till dodger came round and he engaged him right off
tim bolton nodded knowingly
it was a plan he said
the man wanted to get hold of dodger
what puzzles me is that you said he was an old man
his hair and beard were gray
and curtis has no beard and his hair is black
but the boy said he didn't look like an old man except the hair
he walked off like a young man
tim bolton's face lighted up with sudden intelligence
i'll bet a hat it was curtis in disguise he soliloquized
that's all we could find out mr bolton said briggs with another longing look at the bar
it is enough
you have earned your whiskey
walk up gentlemen
hooker and briggs needed no second invitation
will either of you take a note for me to mrs o'keefe
for another drink of course
i will tim said hooker eagerly
no take me mr bolton entreated briggs
you can both go said tim generously
wait a minute and i'll have it ready for you
he found a half sheet of note paper and scribbled on it this message mrs o'keefetell miss linden that i have a clew
i am almost surtin her cozen has got away with dodger
he won't hurt him but he will get him out of the city
wen i hear more i will right
t
bolton
chapter xxvi
bolton makes a discovery
i see it all bolton said to himself thoughtfully
curtis waring is afraid of the boyand of me
he's circumvented me neatly and the game is hisso far my little plan is dished
i must find out for certain whether he's had anything to do with gettin' dodger out of the way and then tim bolton you must set your wits to work to spoil his little game
bolton succeeded in securing the services of a young man who had experience at tending bar and about eight o'clock after donning his best attire he hailed a fourth avenue surface car and got aboard
getting out at the proper street he made his way to madison avenue and ascended the steps of john linden's residence
the door was opened by jane who eyed the visitor with no friendly glance
what do you want
she asked in a hostile tone
is mr waring at home
i don't know
is miss florence at home
do you know her
she asked
yes i am a friend of hers
jane evidently thought that florence must have made some queer friends
have you seen her lately
she asked eagerly
i saw her today
is she well
yes she is well but she is in trouble
is she does she need any money
no it isn't that
the boy dodger has disappeared and she is afraid something has happened to him
oh i am so sorry
he was a good friend of miss florence
i see you know him
i am trying to help him and her
but you asked for mr
waring
said jane suspiciously
so i did
shall i tell you why
i wish you would
i think he has something to do with gettin' dodger out of the way and i'm goin' to try to find out
he won't tell you
you don't understand
i shall make him think i am on his side
was he at home last night
he went away at dinner time and he didn't come home till after twelve
i ought to know for he forgot his latchkey and i had to get up and let him in
i won't do it again
i'll let him stay out first
i see he was with dodger no doubt
did you say he was in
no sir but he will be in directly
won't you step into the library
shall i meet the old gentleman there
asked bolton in a tone of hesitation
no
he goes up to his chamber directly after dinner
how is he
i think he's failing
i hope there is no immediate danger said bolton anxiously
no but he's worrying about miss florence
it's my belief that if she were at home he'd live a good while
doesn't he ask for her
mr curtis tells him she'll come round soon if he'll only be firm
i don't see for my part why mr linden wants her to marry such a disagreeable man
there's plenty better husbands she could get
come in sir and i'll tell him as soon as he comes in
shall you see miss florence soon
i think so
then tell her not to give up
things will come right some time
i'll tell her
bolton was ushered into the library where amid the fashionable furniture he looked quite out of place
he did not feel so however for he drew a cigar out of his pocket and lighting it nonchalantly leaned back in a luxurious armchair and began to smoke
curtis waring is well fixedthat's a fact
he soliloquized
i suppose he is the master here for the old man isn't likely to interfere
still he will like it better when his uncle is out of the way
he had to wait but fifteen minutes in solitude for at the end of that time curtis waring appeared
he paused on the threshold and frowned when he saw who it was that awaited him
jane told me that a gentleman was waiting to see me he said
well she was right
and you i suppose are the gentleman
said curtis in a sneering tone
yes i am the gentleman remarked bolton coolly
i am not in the habit of receiving visits from gentlemen of your class
however i suppose you have an object in calling
it shall go hard with me if i don't pay you for your sneers some day thought bolton but he remained outwardly unruffled
well he answered i can't say that i have any particular business to see you about
i saw your cousin recently
florence
asked curtis eagerly
yes
what did she say
did you speak with her
yes
she doesn't seem any more willin' to marry you
curtis waring frowned
she is a foolish girl he said
she doesn't know her own mind
she looks to me like a gal that knows her own mind particularly well
pshaw
what can you know about it
then you really expect to marry her some time mr
waring
certainly i do
and to inherit your uncle's fortune
of course
why not
i was thinkin' of the boy
the boy is dead what
exclaimed bolton jumping to his feet in irresistible excitement
don't be a fool
wait till i finish my sentence
he is dead so far as his prospects are concerned
who is there that can identify him with the lost child of john linden
i can
yes if any one would believe you
however it is for your interest to keep silent
that is just what i want to know
i suppose you can make it for my interest
yes and willafter i get the property
i don't believe in counting my chickens before they are hatched
of course you know that the boy has left me
said bolton
yes answered curtis indifferently
he is with my cousin i believe
yes and through her i can learn where he is and get hold of him if i desire
a cynical smile played over the face of curtis waring
do you propose to get him back
he asked shrugging his shoulders
i am right thought bolton shrewdly
from his manner it is easy to see that curtis is quite at ease as regards dodger
he knows where he is
you asked me what business i came about mr waring he said after a pause
yes
of course i am devoted to your interests but is it quite fair to make me wait till you come into your fortune before allowing me anything
i think so
you don't seem to consider that i can bring the boy here and make him known to your uncle as the son he lost so long ago
you are quite sure you can bring the boy here
asked curtis
why not
i have only to go to florence and ask her to send the boy to me
you are quite at liberty to do so if you like tim bolton said curtis with a mocking smile
i am glad at any rate that you have shown me what is in your mind
you are very sharp but you are not quite so sharp as i am
i don't understand you
then i will be more explicit
it's out of your power to make use of the boy against me because well
because he is not in the city
where is he then
where you are not likely to find him
if you have killed him bolton began but curtis interrupted him
the boy is safei will tell you that much he said but for reasons which you can guess i think it better that he should be out of new york
when the proper time comes and all is safe he may come back but not in time to help you in your cunning plans mr tim bolton
then i suppose said bolton assuming an air of mortification and discomfiture it is no use for me to remain here any longer
you are quite right
i wish you a pleasant journey home
give my love to florence when you see her
that man is a fiend
soliloquized bolton as he walked back leisurely to his place of business
let me get hold of dodger and i will foil him yet
chapter xxvii
dodger strikes luck
when dodger landed in san francisco in spite of the fact that he had made the journey against his will he felt a natural exhilaration and pleasure in the new and striking circumstances and scenes in which he found himself placed
it was in the year and the city was by no means what it is now
yet it probably contained not far from two hundred thousand people lively earnest enterprising
all seemed busy and hopeful and dodger caught the contagion
as he walked with the reporter to a modest hotel where the rates were a dollar and a half a day not far from montgomery street randolph leslie asked how do you like san francisco thus far arthur
it will be remembered that dodger feeling that the name by which he had hitherto been known was hardly likely to recommend him adopted the one given him by curtis waring
i think i shall like it ever so much answered dodger
everybody seems to be wideawake
do you think you will like it better than new york
i think a poor boy will have more of a chance of making a living here
in new york i was too well known
if i got a place anywhere some one would recognize me as tim bolton's boyaccustomed to tend baror some gentleman would remember that he had bought papers of me
here nobody knows me and i can start fair
there is a great deal in what you say returned leslie
what do you think of trying to do
first of all i will write a letter to florence and tell her i am all right
how long does it take a letter to go from here to new york
about seven days
and it took us over four months
that seems wonderful
yes there is a great difference between coming by sea around cape horn and speeding across the country on an express train
if i could only know how florence is getting along dodger said anxiously
i suppose she thinks i am dead
you forget the letter you gave to the vessel we spoke off the coast of brazil
yes but do you think it went straight
the chances are in favor of it
however your idea is a good one
write by all means and then we will discuss future plans
what are your plans mr
leslie
i shall try to secure a reporter's berth on one of the daily papers the call or chronicle
i will wait a few days however as i have a few hundred dollars by me and can afford to take a little time to look around
i wish i were as well provided but i have less than twentyfive dollars
don't worry about that arthur said randolph laying his hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder
i shall not allow you to want
thank you mr leslie said dodger gratefully
it's something new to me to have a friend like you
but i don't want to be any expense to you
i am large enough and strong enough to earn my own living
true and i feel sure you will have a chance in this enterprising city
they bought copies of the day's papers and dodger looked eagerly over the advertising columns
at length he saw an advertisement that read as follows wanteda young man of or to assist in the office of a local express
inquire at no
st do you think i would answer for such a place
he asked
i don't see why not
at any rate 'nothing venture nothing gain'
you may as well go around and inquire
and by the way as your suit is rather shabby let me lend you one of mine
we are of nearly the same size
thank you mr
leslie
fine feathers make fine birds you know and a neat dress always increases the chances of an applicant for employment though when it is carried too far it is apt to excite suspicion
i remember a friend of mine advertised for a bookkeeper
among the applicants was a young man wearing a sixtydollar suit a ruffled shirt a handsome gold watch and a diamond pin
he was a man of taste and he was strongly impressed with the young man's elegant appearance
so largely upon the strength of these he engaged him and in less than six months discovered that he had been swindled to the extent of eight hundred dollars by his aesthetic bookkeeper
then i will leave my diamond pin at home said dodger smiling
suppose they ask me for recommendations
i will go with you and indorse you
i happen to know one or two prominent gentlemen in san franciscoamong them the president of a bankand i presume my indorsement will be sufficient
dodger went back to the hotel put on a suit of mr leslie's got his boots blacked and then in company with the young reporter went to the express office
i am afraid some one will have been engaged already said the reporter but if not your chances will be good
they entered a goodsized office on a prominent street and dodger inquired for mr tucker
a small man of about forty keeneyed and alert eyed him attentively
i am mr tucker he said
i saw your advertisement for an assistant mr tucker said dodger modestly have you filled the place
let me see said tucker reflectively you are the ninth young man who has appliedbut the place is still open
then i am afraid you won't want me as you have rejected so many
i don't know
how long have you been in the city
i only just arrived
where from
from new york
have you any idea of going to the mines when you get money enough
i think i would prefer to remain in the city
good
how is your education
i have never been to college answered dodger with a smile
good
i don't care for your college men
i am a practical man myself
i am a poor scholar but mr leslie tells me i write a fair hand
let me see a specimen of your writing
now dodger had taken special pains on the voyage to improve his penmanship with excellent results
so it happened that the specimen which he furnished had the good fortune to please mr tucker
good
he said
you will a part of the time be taking orders
your handwriting is plain and will do
never mind about latin and greek
you won't need it
chinese would be more serviceable to you here
when can you go to work
tomorrow morning
today if necessary answered dodger promptly
mr tucker seemed pleased with his answer
tomorrow morning let it be then
hours are from eight in the morning till six at night
very well sir
your wages will be fifteen dollars a week
how will that suit you
dodger wanted to indulge in a loud whoop of exultation for fifteen dollars was beyond his wildest hopes but he was too politic to express his delight
so he contented himself with saying i shall be quite satisfied with that
oh by the way i suppose i ought to have some reference said mr tucker though as a general thing i judge a good deal by outward appearance
i can refer you to my friend mr leslie here
and who will indorse him
asked the expressman shrewdly
leslie smiled
i see mr tucker you are a thorough man of business
i can refer you to mr president of the bank in this city
that is sufficient sir
i am sure you would not refer me to him unless you felt satisfied that he would speak favorably of you
i won't therefore take the trouble to inquire
where are you staying
at the pacific hotel but we shall take a private apartment within a day or two
as they passed out of the office randolph leslie said you've done splendidly arthur
haven't i
i feel like a millionaire
as you are to go to work tomorrow we may as well take up a room at once
it will be cheaper
in a short time they had engaged a neat suite of rooms two in number not far from the palace hotel at twenty dollars per month
the next day leslie procured a position on the san francisco chronicle at twentyfive dollars per week
chapter xxviii
florence receives a letter
the discovery through tim bolton that curtis waring had a hand in the disappearance of dodger partially relieved the anxiety of florencebut only partially
he might be detained in captivity but even that was far better than an accident to life or limb
she knew that he would try to get word to her at the earliest opportunity in order to relieve her fears
but week after week passed and no tidings came
at length at the end of ten weeks a note came to her written on a rough sheet of paper the envelope marked by a foreign stamp
it ran thus dear florencei am sure you have worried over my disappearance
perhaps you thought i was dead but i was never better in my life
i am on the ship columbia bound for san francisco around cape horn and just now as one of the officers tells me we are off the coast of brazil
there is a ship coming north and we are going to hail her and give her letters to carry home so i hope these few lines will reach you all right
i suppose i am in for it and must keep on to san francisco
but i haven't told you yet how i came here
it was through a trick of your cousin curtis waring
i haven't time to tell you about it but i was drugged and brought aboard in my sleep when i woke up i was forty miles at sea
don't worry about me for i have a good friend on board mr randolph leslie who has been a reporter on one of the new york daily papers
he advises me to get something to do in san francisco and work till i have earned money enough to get home
he says i can do better there where i am not known and can get higher pay
he is giving me lessons every day and he says i am learning fast
the ship is almost here and i must stop
take good care of yourself and remember me to mrs o'keefe and i will write you again as soon as i get to san francisco
dodger
p sdon't let on to curtis that you have heard from me or he might try to play me some trick in san francisco
florence's face was radiant when she had read the letter
dodger was alive well and in good spirits
the letter arrived during the afternoon and she put on her street dress at once and went over to the applestand and read the letter to mrs o'keefe
well well
ejaculated the applewoman
so it's that ould thafe of the worruld curtis waring that has got hold of poor dodger just as tim told us
it seems mighty quare to me that he should want to stale poor dodger
if it was you now i could understand it
it seems strange to me mrs o'keefe said florence thoughtfully
i thought it might be because dodger was my friend but that doesn't seem to be sufficient explanation
don't you think we ought to show this letter to mr
bolton
i was going to suggest that same
if you'll give it to me florence i'll get mattie to tend my stand and slip round wid it to tim's right off
i will go with you mrs
o'keefe
mattie who was playing around the corner was summoned
now mattie just mind the stand and don't be runnin' away or them boys will get away wid my whole mornin's profits
do you hear
yes mum
and don't you be eatin' all the while you are here
here's one apple you can have and the applewoman carefully picked out one that she considered unsalable
that's specked mrs o'keefe objected mattie
and what if it is
can't you bite out the specks
the rest of the apple is good
you're gettin' mighty particular
mattie bit a piece out of the sound part of the apple and when mrs o'keefe was at a safe distance gave the rest to a lame bootblack and picked out one of the best apples for her own eating
bridget o'keefe is awful mane wid her apples
soliloquized mattie but i'm too smart for her
tryin' to pass off one of her old specked apples on me
if i don't take three good one i'm a sinner
arrived at the front of the saloon mrs o'keefe penetrated the interior and met tim near the door
have you come in for some whiskey old lady
asked tim in a jesting tone
i'll take that by and by
florence is outside and we've got some news for you
won't she come in
no she don't like to be seen in a place like this
she's got a letter from dodger
you don't mean it
ejaculated tim with sudden interest
where is he
come out and see
good afternoon miss linden said tim gallantly
so you've news from dodger
yes here is the letter
bolton read it through attentively
curtis is smart he said as he handed it back
he couldn't have thought of a better plan for getting rid of the boy
it will take several months for him to reach 'frisco and after that he can't get back for he won't have any money
dodger says he will try to save money enough to pay his way back
it will take him a good while
it doesn't take long to come back by cars does it
no but it costs a great deal of money
why it may take dodger a year to earn enough to pay his way back on the railroad
a year
exclaimed florence in genuine dismaya year in addition to the time it takes to go out there
where will we all be at the end of that time
not in jail i hope answered bolton jocularly
i am afraid your uncle will no longer be in the land of the living
a shadow came over florence's face
poor uncle john
she said sadly
it is terrible to think he may die thinking hardly of me
leavin' his whole fortune to curtis continued tim
that is the least thing that troubles me said florence
a woman's a queer thing said tim shrugging his shoulders
here's a fortune of maybe half a million and half of it rightfully yours and you don't give it a thought
not compared with the loss of my uncle's affections
money is a great deal more practical than affection
perhaps so from your standpoint mr bolton said florence with dignity
no offense miss
when you've lived as long as i you'll look at things different
well i'm glad to hear from the lad
if curtis had done him any harm i'd have got even with him if it sent me to jail
a quiet determined look replaced tim bolton's usual expression of easy good humor
he could not have said anything that would have ingratiated him more with florence
thank you mr bolton she said earnestly
i shall always count upon your help
i believe you are a true friend of dodger and of yours too miss i believe it she said with a smile that quite captivated tim
if it would be any satisfaction to you miss florence he continued i'll give curtis waring a lickin'
he deserves it for persecutin' you and gettin' you turned out of your uncle's house
thank you mr bolton it wouldn't be any satisfaction to me to see curtis injured in any way
you're too good a christian you are miss florence
i wish i deserved your praise but i can hardly lay claim to it
now mr bolton tell me what can i do to help dodger
i don't see that you can do anything now as it will be most three months before he reaches 'frisco
you might write to him toward the time he gets there
i will
direct to the post office
i think he'll have sense enough to ask for letters
i wish i could send him some money
i am afraid he will land penniless
if he lands in good health you can trust him for makin' a livin'
a new york boy brought up as he was isn't goin' to starve where there are papers to sell and errands to run
why he'll light on his feet in 'frisco take my word for it
florence felt a good deal encouraged by tim's words of assurance and she went home with her heart perceptibly lightened
but she was soon to have trials of her own which for the time being would make her forgetful of dodger
chapter xxix
mrs leighton's party
miss linden said mrs leighton one day in the fourth month of dodger's absence carrie has perhaps told you that i give a party next thursday evening
she told me answered the governess
i expected prof bouvier to furnish dancing musicin fact i had engaged himbut i have just received a note stating that he is unwell and i am left unprovided
it is very inconsiderate on his part added the lady in a tone of annoyance
florence did not reply
she took rather a different view of the professor's letter and did not care to offend mrs leighton
under the circumstances continued the lady it has occurred to me that as you are really quite a nice performer you might fill his place
i shall be willing to allow you a dollar for the evening
what do you say
florence felt embarrassed
she shrank from appearing in society in her present separation from her family yet could think of no good excuse
noticing her hesitation mrs leighton added patronizingly on second thought i will pay you a dollar and a halfprof bouvier was to have charged ten dollarsand you will be kind enough to come in your best attire
you seem to be well provided with dresses
yes madam there will be no difficulty on that score
nor on any other i hope
as governess in my family i think i have a right to command your services
i will come said florence meekly
she felt that it would not do to refuse after this
as she entered the handsomely decorated rooms on the night of the party she looked around her nervously fearing to see some one whom she had known in earlier days
she noticed one onlypercy de brabazon whose face lighted up when he saw her for he had been expecting to see her
she managed to convey a caution by a quiet movement as it would not be wise for mrs leighton to know of their previous acquaintance
but percy was determined to get an opportunity to speak to her
who is that young lady aunt mary
he asked
the one standing near the piano
that is carrie's governess answered mrs leighton carelessly
she seems quite a ladylike person
yes
i understand she has seen better days
she is to play for us in the absence of prof
bouvier
will you introduce me aunt
why
asked mrs leighton with a searching look
i should like to inquire about carrie's progress in her studies said the cunning percy
oh certainly answered the aunt quite deceived by his words
miss linden she said let me introduce my nephew mr de brabazon
he wishes to inquire about carrie's progress in her studies
and the lady sailed off to another part of the room
i can assure you mr de brabazon said florence that my young charge is making excellent progress
i can easily believe it under your instruction said percy
i am very glad you take such an interest in your cousin added florence with a smile
it does you great credit
it's only an excuse you know to get a chance to talk with you miss linden
may i say miss florence
no answered florence decidedly
it won't do
you must be very formal
then tell me how you like teaching
very well indeed
it must be an awful bore i think
i don't think so
carrie is a warmhearted affectionate girl
besides she is very bright and gives me very little trouble
don't you think you could take another pupil miss linden
a young girl
no a young man
in fact myself
what could i teach you mr de brabazon
lots of things
i am not very sound inin spelling and grammar
what a pity
answered florence with mock seriousness
i am afraid your aunt would hardly consent to have a boy of your size in the schoolroom
then perhaps you could give me some private lessons in the afternoon
that would not be possible
just then mrs leighton came up
well she said what does miss linden say of carrie
she has quite satisfied my mind about her answered percy with excusable duplicity
i think her methods are excellent
i was telling her that i might be able to procure her another pupil
i have no objection as long as it does not interfere with carrie's hours
miss linden there is a call for music
will you go to the piano and play a stauss waltz
florence inclined her head obediently
let me escort you to the piano miss linden said percy
thank you answered florence in a formal tone
for an hour florence was engaged in playing waltzes gallops and lanciers music
then a lady who was proud of her daughter's proficiency volunteered her services to relieve florence
now you can dance yourself said percy in a low tone
will you give me a waltz
not at once
wait till the second dance
percy de brabazon was prompt in presenting himself as soon as permitted and he led florence out for a dance
both were excellent dancers and attracted general attention
florence really enjoyed dancing and forgot for a time that she was only a guest on sufferance as she moved with rhythmic grace about the handsome rooms
percy was disposed to prolong the dance but florence was cautious
i think i will rest now mr de brabazon she said
you will favor me again later in the evening
he pleaded
i hardly think it will be wise
but when half an hour later he asked her again florence could not find it in her heart to say no
it would have been wise if she had done so
a pair of jealous eyes was fixed upon her
miss emily carter had for a considerable time tried to fascinate mr de brabazon whose wealth made him a very desirable match and she viewed his decided penchant for florence with alarm and indignation
to be thrown in the shade by a governess is really too humiliating
she murmured to herself in vexation
if it were a girl in my own station i should not care so much and she eyed florence with marked hostility
mamma she said do you see how mr de barbazon is carrying on with mrs leighton's governess
really i think it very discreditable
mrs carter looked through her gold eyeglasses at the couple
is the girl really a governess
she added
she is very well dressed
i don't know where she got her dress but she is really a governess
she seems very bold
so she does
poor florence
she was far from deserving their unkindly remarks
i suppose she is trying to ensnare young de brabazon said emily spitefully
people of her class are very artful
don't you think it would be well to call mrs leighton's attention
percy de brabazon is her nephew you know
true
the suggestion is a good one emily
mrs carter was quite as desirous as her daughter of bringing about an alliance with percy and she readily agreed to second her plans
she looked about for mrs leighton and took a seat at her side
your nephew seems quite attentive to your governess she commenced
indeed
in what way
he has danced with her three or four times i believe
it looks rather marked
so it does said mrs leighton
he is quite inconsiderate
oh well it is of no great consequence
she is quite stylish for a governess and doubtless your nephew is taken with her
that will not suit my views at all said mrs leighton coldly
i shall speak to her tomorrow
pray don't
it really is a matter of small consequencequite natural in fact
leave the matter with me
you have done quite right in mentioning it
at twelve o'clock the next day when florence had just completed her lessons with carrie mrs leighton entered the room
please remain a moment miss linden she said
i have a few words to say to you
mrs leighton's tone was cold and unfriendly and florence felt that something unpleasant was coming
chapter xxx
florence is followed home
i am listening madam said florence inclining her head
i wish to speak to you about last evening miss linden
i hope my playing was satisfactory mrs leighton
i did my best
i have no fault to find with your music
it came up to my expectations
i am glad of that madam
i referred rather to your behavior miss linden
i don't understand you mrs leighton florence responded in unaffected surprise
please explain
you danced several times with my nephew mr percy de brabazon
twice madam
i understood it was oftener
however that is immaterial
you hardly seemed conscious of your position
what was my position mrs
leighton
asked florence quietly looking her employer in the face
wellahem
answered mrs leighton a little ill at ease you were a hired musician
well
and you acted as if you were an invited guest
i am sorry you did not give me instructions as to my conduct said the governess coldly
i should not have danced if i had been aware that it was prohibited
i am sorry miss linden that you persist in misunderstanding me
mr de brabazon being in a different social position from yourself it looked hardly proper that he should have devoted himself to you more than to any other lady
did he
i was not aware of it
don't you think under the circumstances that he is the one whom you should take to task
i didn't invite his attentions
you seemed glad to receive them
i was
he is undoubtedly a gentleman
certainly he is
he is my nephew
it was not my part to instruct him as to what was proper surely
you are very plausible
miss linden i think it right to tell you that your conduct was commented upon by one of my lady guests as unbecoming
however i will remember in extenuation that you are unaccustomed to society and doubtless erred ignorantly
florence bowed but forbore to make any remark
do you wish to speak further to me mrs
leighton
no i think not
then i will bid you goodmorning
when the governess had left the house mrs leighton asked herself whether in her encounter with her governess the victory rested with her and she was forced to acknowledge that it was at least a matter of doubt
miss linden is a faithful teacher but she does not appear to appreciate the difference that exists between her and my guests
i think however that upon reflection she will see that i am right in my stricture upon her conduct
florence left the house indignant and mortified
it was something new to her to be regarded as a social inferior and she felt sure that there were many in mrs leighton's position who would have seen no harm in her behavior on the previous evening
four days afterward when florence entered the madison avenue car to ride downtown she had scarcely reached her seat when an eager voice addressed her miss linden how fortunate i am in meeting you
florence looked up and saw mr de brabazon sitting nearly opposite her
though she felt an esteem for him she was sorry to see him for with mrs leighton's rebuke fresh in her mind it could only be a source of embarrassment and if discovered subject her in all probability to a fresh reprimand
you are kind to say so mr de brabazon
not at all
i hoped i might meet you again soon
what a pleasant time we had at the party
i thought so at the time but the next day i changed my mind
why may i ask
because your aunt mrs leighton took me to task for dancing with you twice
was she so absurd
ejaculated percy
it is not necessarily absurd
she said our social positions were so different that it was unbecoming for me to receive attention from you
rubbish
exclaimed percy warmly
i am afraid i ought not to listen to such strictures upon the words of my employer
i wish you didn't have to teach
i can't join you in that wish
i enjoy my work
but you ought to be relieved from the necessity
we must accept things as we find them said florence gravely
there is a way out of it said percy quickly
you understand me do you not
i think i do mr de brabazon and i am grateful to you but i am afraid it can never be
percy remained silent
how far are you going
asked florence uneasily for she did not care to have her companion learn where she lived
i intend to get out at fourteenth street
then i must bid you goodafternoon for we are already at fifteenth street
if i can be of any service to you i will ride farther
thank you said florence hastily but it is quite unnecessary
then good morning
and percy descended from the car
in another part of the car sat a young lady who listened with sensations far from pleasant to the conversation that had taken place between florence and mr de brabazon
it was emily carter whose jealousy had been excited on the evening of the party
she dropped her veil fearing to be recognized by mr de brabazon with whom she was well acquainted
she too had intended getting off at fourteenth street but decided to remain longer in the car
i will find out where that girl lives she resolved
her conduct with percy de brabazon is positively disgraceful
she is evidently doing her best to captivate him
i feel that it is due to mrs leighton who would be shocked at the thought of her nephew's making a low alliance to find out all i can and put her on her guard
she kept her seat still keeping her veil down for it was possible that florence might recognize her and the car moved steadily onward till it turned into the bowery
where on earth is she leading me
miss carter asked herself
i have never been in this neighborhood before
however it won't do to give up when i am perhaps on the verge of some important discoveries
still the car sped on
not far from grand street florence left the car followed though she was unconscious of it by her aristocratic fellowpassenger
florence stopped a moment to speak to mrs o'keefe at her applestand
so you're through wid your work florence
are you goin' home
yes mrs
o'keefe
then i'll go wid you for i've got a nasty headache and i'll lie down for an hour
they crossed the street not noticing the veiled young lady who followed within ear shot and listened to their conversation
at length they reached the tenement houseflorence's humble homeand went in
i've learned more than i bargained for said emily carter in malicious exultation
i am well repaid for coming to this horrid part of the city
i wonder if mr de brabazon knows where his charmer lives
i will see that mrs leighton knows at any rate
chapter xxxi
florence is discharged
mrs leighton sat in her boudoir with a stern face and tightly compressed lips
miss carter had called the previous afternoon and informed her of the astounding discoveries she had made respecting the governess
she rang the bell
janet she said when the governess comes you may bring her up here to me
yes ma'am
she's going to catch iti wonder what for
thought janet as she noted the grim visage of her employer
so when florence entered the house she was told that mrs leighton wished to see her at once
i wonder what's the matter now
she asked herself
has she heard of my meeting her nephew in the car
when she entered the room she saw at once that something was wrong
you wished to see me mrs
leighton
she said
yes answered mrs leighton grimly
will you be seated
florence sat down a few feet from her employer and waited for an explanation
she certainly was not prepared for mrs leighton's first words miss linden where do you live
florence started and her face flushed
i live in the lower part of the city she answered with hesitation
that is not sufficiently definite
i live at no
street
i think that is east of the bowery
you are right madam
you lodge with an applewoman do you not
i do answered florence calmly
in a tenement house
yes madam
and you actually come from such a squalid home to instruct my daughter
exclaimed mrs leighton indignantly
it is a wonder you have not brought some terrible disease into the house
there has been no case of disease in the humble dwelling in which i make my home
i should be as sorry to expose your daughter to any danger of that kind as you would be to have me
it is a merciful dispensation of providence for which i ought to be truly thankful
but the idea of receiving in my house an inmate of a tenement house
i am truly shocked
is this applewoman your mother
i assure you that she is not answered florence with a smile which she could not repress
or your aunt
she is in no way related to me
she is an humble friend
miss linden your tastes must be low to select such a home and such a friend
the state of my purse had something to do with the selection and the kindness shown me by mrs o'keefe when i needed a friend will explain my location further
that is not all
you met in the madison avenue car yesterday my nephew mr percy de brabazon
it is coming thought florence
who could have seen us
then aloud yes madam
was it by appointment
do you mean to insult me mrs
leighton
demanded florence rising and looking at the lady with flashing eyes
i never insult anybody replied mrs leighton
pray resume your seat
florence did so
then i may assume that it was accidental
you talked together with the freedom of old friends
you are correctly informed
you seem to make acquaintances very readily miss linden
it seems singular to say the least that after meeting my nephew for a single evening you should become such intimate friends
you will be surprised mrs leighton when i say that mr de brabazon and i are old friends
we have met frequently
where in heaven's name
ejaculated mrs leighton
at my residence
good heavens
exclaimed the scandalized lady
does my nephew percy visit at the house of this applewoman
no madam
he does not know where i live
then you will explain your previous statement
said mrs leighton haughtily
i am at present suffering reversed circumstances
it is but a short time since i was very differently situated
i won't inquire into your change of circumstances
i feel compelled to perform an unpleasant duty
florence did not feel called upon to make any reply but waited for mrs leighton to finish speaking
i shall be obliged to dispense with your services as my daughter's governess
it is quite out of the question for me to employ a person who lives in a tenementhouse
florence bowed acquiescence but she felt very sad
she had become attached to her young charge and it cost her a pang to part from her
besides how was she to supply the income of which this would deprive her
i bow to your decision madam she said with proud humility
you will find here the sum that i owe you with payment for an extra week in lieu of notice
thank you
may i bid carrie goodby mrs
leighton
it is better not to do so i think
the more quietly we dissolve our unfortunate connection the better
florence's heart swelled and the tears came to her eyes but she could not press her request
she was destined however to obtain the privilege which mrs leighton denied her
carrie who had become impatient came downstairs and burst into the room
what keeps you so long miss linden
she said
is mamma keeping you
florence was silent leaving the explanations to mrs leighton
miss linden has resigned her position as your governess carrie
miss linden going away
i won't have her go
what makes you go miss linden
your mamma thinks it best answered florence with moistened eyes
well i don't
exclaimed carrie stamping her foot angrily
i won't have any other governess but you
carrie you are behaving very unbecomingly said her mother
will you tell me mamma why you are sending miss linden away
i will tell you some other time
but i want to know now
i am very much displeased with you carrie
and i am very much displeased with you mamma
i do not pretend to defend carrie whose conduct was hardly respectful enough to her mother but with all her faults she had a warm heart while her mother had always been cold and selfish
i am getting tired of this said mrs leighton
miss linden as you are here today you may give carrie the usual lessons
as i shall be out when you get through i bid you goodby now
goodby mrs
leighton
carrie and florence went to the schoolroom for the last time
florence gave her young pupil a partial explanation of the cause which had led to her discharge
what do i care if you live in a poor house miss linden
said carrie impetuously
i will make mamma take you back
florence smiled but she knew that there would be no return for her
when she reached her humble home she had a severe headache and lay down
mrs o'keefe came in later to see her
and what's the matter with you florence
she asked
i have a bad headache mrs
o'keefe
you work too hard florence wid your teacher
that is what gives you the headache
then i shan't have it again for i have got through with my teaching
what's that you say
i am discharged
and what's it all about
florence explained matters
mrs o'keefe became indignant
she's a mean trollop that mrs
leighton
she exclaimed and i'd like to tell her so to her face
where does she live
it will do no good to interfere my good friend
she is not willing to receive a governess from a tenement house
shure you used to live in as grand a house as herself
but i don't now
don't mind it too much mavoureen
you'll soon be gettin' another scholar
go to sleep now and you'll sleep the headache away
florence finally succeeded in following the advice of her humble friend
she resolved to leave till the morrow the cares of the morrow
she had twelve dollars and before that was spent she hoped to be in a position to earn some more
chapter xxxii
an exciting adventure
dodger soon became accustomed to his duties at tucker's express office in his new san francisco home
he found mr tucker an exacting but not an unreasonable man
he watched his new assistant closely for the first few days and was quietly taking his measure
at the end of the first week he paid the salary agreed uponfifteen dollars
you have been with me a week arthur he said
yes sir
and i have been making up my mind about you
yes sir said dodger looking up inquiringly
i hope you are satisfied with me
yes i think i may say that i am
you don't seem to be afraid of work
i have always been accustomed to work
that is well
i was once induced to take the son of a rich man in the place you now occupy
he had never done a stroke of work having always been at school
he didn't take kindly to work and seemed afraid that he would be called upon to do more than he had bargained for
one evening i was particularly busy and asked him to remain an hour overtime
'it will be very inconvenient mr tucker' said the young man 'as i have an engagement with a friend'
he left me to do all the extra work andi suppose you know what happened the next saturday evening
i can guess returned dodger with a smile
i told him that i thought the duties were too heavy for his constitution and he had better seek an easier place
let me seei kept you an hour and a half overtime last wednesday
yes sir
you made no objection but worked on just as if you liked it
yes sir i am always willing to stay when you need me
good
i shan't forget it
dodger felt proud of his success and put away the fifteen dollars with a feeling of satisfaction
he had never saved half that sum in the same time before
curtis waring did me a favor when he sent me out here he reflected but as he didn't mean it i have no occasion to feel grateful
dodger found that he could live for eight dollars a week and he began to lay by seven dollars a week with the view of securing funds sufficient to take him back to new york
he was in no hurry to leave san francisco but he felt that florence might need a friend
but he found that he was making progress slowly
at that time the price of a firstclass ticket to new york was one hundred and twentyeight dollars besides the expense of sleeping berths amounting then as now to twentytwo dollars extra
so it looked as if dodger would be compelled to wait at least six months before he should be in a position to set out on the return journey
about this time dodger received a letter from florence in which she spoke of her discharge by mrs leighton
i shall try to obtain another position as teacher she said concealing her anxiety
i am sure in a large city i can find something to do
but dodger knew better than she the difficulties that beset the path of an applicant for work and he could not help feeling anxious for florence
if i were only in new york he said to himself i would see that florence didn't suffer
i will write her to let me know if she is in need and i will send her some money
about this time he met with an adventure which deserves to be noted
it was about seven o'clock one evening that he found himself in mission street
at a street corner his attention was drawn to a woman poorly dressed who held by the hand a child of three
her clothing was shabby and her attitude was one of despondency
it was clear that she was ill and in trouble
dodger possessed quick sympathies and his own experience made him quick to understand and feel for the troubles of others
though the woman made no appeal he felt instinctively that she needed help
i beg your pardon he said with as much deference as if he were addressing one favored by fortune but you seem to be in need of help
god knows i am
said the woman sadly
perhaps i can be of service to you
will you tell me how
neither i nor my child has tasted food since yesterday
well that can be easily remedied said dodger cheerfully
there is a restaurant close by
i was about to eat supper
will you come in with me
i am ashamed to impose upon the kindness of a stranger murmured the woman
don't mention it
i shall be very glad of company said dodger heartily
but you are a poor boy
you may be ill able to afford the expense
i am not a millionaire said dodger and i don't see any immediate prospect of my building a palace on nob hillwhere live some of san francisco's wealthiest citizensbut i am very well supplied with money
then i will accept your kind invitation
it was a small restaurant but neat in its appointments and as in most san francisco restaurants the prices were remarkably moderate
at an expense of twentyfive cents each the three obtained a satisfactory meal
the woman and child both seemed to enjoy it and dodger was glad to see that the former became more cheerful as time went on
there was something in the child's face that looked familiar to dodger
it was a resemblance to some one that he had seen but he could not for the life of him decide who it was
how can i ever thank you for your kindness
said the lady as she arose from the table
you don't know what it is to be famished don't i
asked dodger
i have been hungry more than once without money enough to buy a meal
you don't look it she said
no for now i have a good place and am earning a good salary
are you a native of san francisco
no madam
i can't tell you where i was born for i know little or nothing of my family
i have only been here a short time
i came from new york
so did i said the woman with a sigh
i wish i were back there again
how came you to be here
don't answer if you prefer not to dodger added hastily
i have no objection
my husband deserted me and left me to shift for myself and support my child
how have you done it
by taking in sewing
but that is a hard way of earning money
there are too many poor women who are ready to work for starvation wages and so we all suffer
i know that answered dodger
do you live near here
the woman mentioned a street near by
i have one poor back room on the third floor she explained but i should be glad if i were sure to stay there
is there any danger of your being ejected
i am owing for two weeks' rent and this is the middle of the third week
unless i can pay up at the end of this week i shall be forced to go out into the streets with my poor child
how much rent do you pay
a dollar a week
then three dollars will relieve you for the present
yes but it might as well be three hundred said the woman bitterly
not quite i can supply you with three dollars but three hundred would be rather beyond my means
you are too kind too generous
i ought not to accept such a liberal gift
mamma i am tired
take me up in your arms said the child
poor child
he has been on his feet all day sighed the mother
she tried to lift the child but her own strength had been undermined by privation and she was clearly unable to do so
let me take him
said dodger
here little one jump up
he raised the child easily and despite the mother's protest carried him in his arms
i will see you home madam he said
i fear the child will be too heavy for you
i hope not
why i could carry a child twice as heavy
they reached the room at lasta poor one but a welcome repose from the streets
don't you ever expect to see your husband again
asked dodger
can't you compel him to support you
i don't know where he is answered the woman despondently
if you will tell me his name i may come across him some day
his name said the woman is curtis waring
dodger stared at her overwhelmed with surprise
chapter xxxiii
an important discovery
curtis waring
ejaculated dodger his face showing intense surprise
is that the name of your husband
yes
is it possible that you know him
asked the woman struck by dodger's tone
i know a man by that name
i will describe him and you can tell me whether it is he
he is rather tall dark hair sallow complexion black eyes and a long thin nose
it is like him in every particular
oh tell me where he is to be found
he lives in new york
he is the nephew of a rich man and is expecting to inherit his wealth
through his influence a cousin of his a young lady has been driven from home
was he afraid she would deprive him of the estate
that was partly the reason
but it was partly to revenge himself on her because she would not agree to marry him
but how could he marry her exclaimed the unfortunate woman when he is already married to me
neither she nor any one of his family or friends knew that he was already married
i don't think it would trouble him much
but it must be stopped
she exclaimed wildly
he is my husband
i shall not give him up to any one else
so far as florence is concernedshe is the cousinshe has no wish to deprive you of him
but is it possible that you are attached to a man who has treated you so meanly
asked dodger in surprise
there was a time when he treated me well when he appeared to love me was the murmured reply
i cannot forget that he is the father of my child
dodger did not understand the nature of women or the mysteries of the female heart and he evidently thought this poor woman very foolish to cling with such pertinacity to a man like curtis waring
do you mind telling me how you came to marry him
he asked
it was over four years ago that i met him in this city was the reply
i am a san francisco girl
i had never been out of california
i was considered pretty then she added with a remnant of pride faded as i am today
looking closely in her face dodger was ready to believe this
grief and privation had changed her appearance but it had not altogether effaced the bloom and beauty of youth
at any rate he seemed to think so
he was living at the palace hotel and i made his acquaintance at a small social gathering at the house of my uncle
i am an orphan and was perhaps the more ready to marry on that account
did mr waring represent himself as wealthy
he said he had expectations from a wealthy relative but did not mention where he lived
he told the truth then
we married securing apartments on kearney street
we lived together till my child was born and for three months afterward
then mr waring claimed to be called away from san francisco on business
he said he might be absent six weeks
he left me a hundred dollars and urged me to be careful of it as he was short of money and needed considerable for the expenses of the journey
he left me and i have never seen or heard from him since
did he tell you where he was going mrs
waring
no he said he would be obliged to visit several placesamong others colorado where he claimed to have some mining property
he told me that he hoped to bring back considerable money
do you think he meant to stay away altogether
i don't know what to think
well i lived on patiently for i had perfect confidence in my husband
i made the money last me ten weeks instead of six but then i found myself penniless
did you receive any letters in that time
no and it was that that worried me
when at last the money gave out i began to pawn my thingsmore than once i was tempted to pawn my weddingring but i could not bring my mind to do that
i do not like to think ill of my husband and was forced as the only alternative to conclude that he had met with some accident perhaps had died
i have not felt certain that this was not so till you told me this evening that you know him
i can hardly say that i know him well yet i know him a good deal better than i wish i did
but for him i would not now be in san francisco
how is that
please explain
dodger told her briefly the story of his abduction
but what motive could he have in getting you out of new york
i cannot understand
i don't understand myself except that i am the friend of florence
his cousin
yes
but why should she be compelled to leave her uncle's home
because curtis waring made him set his heart upon the match
she had her choice to marry curtis or to leave the house and forfeit all chance of the estate
she chose to leave the house
she ought to know that he has no right to marry said the poor woman who not understanding the dislike of florence for the man whom she herself loved feared that she might yet be induced to marry him
she ought to know and her uncle ought to know said dodger
mrs waring i can't see my way clear yet
if i were in new york i would know just what to do
will you agree to stand by me and help me
yes i will answered the woman earnestly
i will see you again tomorrow evening
here is some money to help you along for the present
goodnight
dodger as he walked away pondered over the remarkable discovery he had made
it was likely to prove of the utmost importance to florence
her uncle's displeasure was wholly based upon her refusal to marry curtis waring but if it should be proved to him that curtis was already a married man there would seem no bar to reconciliation
moreoverand thas was particularly satisfactoryit would bring curtis himself into disfavor
florence would be reinstated in her rightful place in her uncle's family and once more be recognized as heiress to at least a portion of his large fortune
this last consideration might not weigh so much with florence but dodger was more practical and he wished to restore her to the social position which she had lost through the knavery of her cousin
but in san franciscoat a distance of over three thousand miles dodger felt at a loss how to act
even if mr linden was informed that his nephew had a wife living in san francisco the statement would no doubt be denied by curtis who would brand the woman as an impudent adventuress
the absent are always in the wrong says a french proverb
at all events they are very much at a disadvantage and therefore it seemed imperatively necessary not only that dodger but that curtis waring's wife should go to new york to confront the unprincipled man whose schemes had brought sorrow to so many
it was easy to decide what plan was best but how to carry it out presented a difficulty which seemed insurmountable
the expenses of a journey to new york for dodger mrs waring and her child would not be very far from five hundred dollars and where to obtain this money was a problem
randolph leslie probably had that sum but dodger could not in conscience ask him to lend it being unable to furnish adequate security or to insure repayment
if i could only find a nugget thought dodger knitting his brows everything would be easy
but nuggets are rare enough in the gold fields and still rarer in city streets
he who trusts wholly to luck trusts to a willo'thewisp and is about as sure of success as one who owns a castle in spain
the time might come when dodger by his own efforts could accumulate the needed sum but it would require a year at least and in that time mr linden would probably be dead
absorbed and disturbed by these reflections dodger walked slowly through the darkened streets till he heard a stifled cry and looking up beheld a sight that startled him
on the sidewalk lay the prostrate figure of a man
over him bludgeon in hand bent a ruffian whose purpose was only too clearly evident
chapter xxxiv
just in time
dodger who was a strong stout boy gathered himself up and dashed against the ruffian with such impetuosity that he fell over his intended victim and his bludgeon fell from his hand
it was the work of an instant to lift it and raise it in a menacing position
the discomfited villain broke into a volley of oaths and proceeded to pick himself up
he was a brutallooking fellow but was no larger than dodger who was as tall as the majority of men
give me that stick he exclaimed furiously
come and take it returned dodger undaunted
the fellow took him at his word and made a rush at our hero but a vigorous blow from the bludgeon made him cautious about repeating the attack
curse you
he cried between his teeth
i'd like to chaw you up
i have no doubt you would answered dodger but i don't think you will
were you going to rob this man
none of your business
i shall make it my business
you'd better go or you may be locked up
give me that stick then
you'll have to do without it
he made another rush and dodger struck him such a blow on his arm that he winced with pain
now i shall summon the police and you can do as you please about going
dodger struck the stick sharply on the sidewalk three times and the ruffian apprehensive of arrest ran around the corner just in time to rush into the arms of a policeman
what has this man been doing
asked the city guardian turning to dodger
he was about to rob this man
is the man hurt
where am i
asked the prostrate man in a bewildered tone
i will take care of him if you will take charge of that fellow
can you get up sir
asked dodger bending over the fallen man
the latter answered by struggling to his feet and looking about him in a confused way
where am i
he asked
what has happened
you were attacked by a ruffian
i found you on the sidewalk with him bending over you with this club in his hand
he must have followed me
i was imprudent enough to show a wellfilled pocketbook in a saloon where i stopped to take a drink
no doubt he planned to relieve me of it
you have had a narrow escape sir
i have no doubt of it
i presume the fellow was ready to take my life if he found it necessary
i will leave you now sir if you think you can manage
no stay with me
i feel rather upset
where are you staying sir
at the palace hotel
of course you know where that is
certainly
will you take my arm
thank you
little was said till they found themselves in the sumptuous hotel which hardly has an equal in america
come to my room young man i want to speak to you
it was still early in the evening and dodger's time was his own
he had no hesitation therefore in accepting the stranger's invitation
on the third floor the stranger produced a key and opened the door of a large handsomelyfurnished room
if you have a match please light the gas
dodger proceeded to do so and now for the first time obtained a good view of the man he had rescued
he was a man of about the average height probably not far from fifty dressed in a neat business suit and looked like a substantial merchant
please be seated
dodger sat down in an easychair conveniently near him
young man said the stranger impressively you have done me a great favor
dodger felt that this was true and did not disclaim it
i am very glad i came up just as i did he said
how large a sum of money do you think i had about me
asked his companion
five hundred dollars
five hundred dollars
why that would be a mere trifle
it wouldn't be a trifle to me sir said dodger
are you poor
asked the man earnestly
i have a good situation that pays me fifteen dollars a week so i ought not to consider myself poor
suppose you had a considerable sum of money given you what would you do with it
if i had five hundred dollars i should be able to defeat the schemes of a villain and restore a young lady to her rights
that seems interesting
tell me the circumstances
dodger told the story as briefly as he could
he was encouraged to find that the stranger listened to him with attention
do you know he said reflectively you have done for me what i once did for anothera rich man
the case was very similar
i was a poor boy at the time
do you know what he gave me
what was it sir
a dollar
what do you think of that for generosity
well sir it wasn't exactly liberal
did you accept it
no
i told him that i didn't wish to inconvenience him
but i asked you how much money you supposed i had
i will tell you
in a wallet i have eleven thousand dollars in bank notes and securities
that is a fortune said dodger dazzled at the mention of such a sum
if i had lost it i have plenty more but the most serious peril was to my life
through your opportune assistance i have escaped without loss
i fully appreciate the magnitude of the service you have done me
as an evidence of it please accept these bills
he drew from the roll two bills and handed them to dodger
the boy glancing at them mechanically started in amazement
each bill was for five hundred dollars
you have given me a thousand dollars
he gasped
i am aware of it
i consider my life worth that at least
james swinton never fails to pay his debts
but sir a thousand dollars it's no more than you deserve
when i tell my wife on my return to chicago about this affair she will blame me for not giving you more
you seem to belong to a liberal family sir
i detest meanness and would rather err on the side of liberality
now if agreeable to you i will order a bottle of champagne and solace ourselves for this little incident
thank you mr swinton but i have made up my mind not to drink anything stronger than water
i have tended bar in new york and what i have seen has given me a dislike for liquor of any kind
you are a sensible young man
you are right and i won't urge you
there is my card and if you ever come to chicago call upon me
i will sir
when dodger left the palace hotel he felt that he was a favorite of fortune
it is not always that the money we need is so quickly supplied
he resolved to return to new york as soon as he could manage it and take with him the wife and child of curtis waring
this would cost him about five hundred dollars and he would have the same amount left
mr tucker was reluctant to part with dodger
you are the best assistant i ever had he said
i will pay you twenty dollars a week if that will induce you to stay
i would stay if it were not very important for me to return to new york mr tucker
i do not expect to get a place in new york as good
if you come back to san francisco at any time i will make a place for you
thank you sir
mrs waring was overjoyed when dodger called upon her and offered to take her back to new york
i shall see curtis again she said
how can i ever thank you
but dodger though unwilling to disturb her dreams of happiness thought it exceedingly doubtful if her husband would be equally glad to see her
chapter xxxv
the darkest day
when florence left the employ of mrs leighton she had a few dollars as a reserve fund
as this would not last long she at once made an effort to obtain employment
she desired another position as governess and made application in answer to an advertisement
her ladylike manner evidently impressed the lady to whom she applied
i suppose you have taught before
she said
yes madam
in whose family
i taught the daughter of mrs leighton of west street
i have heard of the lady
of course you are at liberty to refer to her
yes madam but there was a hesitation in her tone that excited suspicion
very well i will call upon her and make inquiries
if you will call tomorrow morning i can give you a decisive answer
florence fervently hoped that this might prove favorable but was apprehensive and with good reason it appeared
when she presented herself the next day mrs cole said i am afraid miss linden you will not suit me
may i ask why
florence inquired schooling herself to calmness
i called on mrs leighton was the answer
she speaks well of you as a teacher butshe told me some things which make it seem inexpedient to engage you
what did she say of me
that perhaps you had better not inquire
i prefer to know the worst
she said you encouraged the attentions of her nephew forgetting the difference in social position and also that your connections were not of a sort to recommend you
i admit miss linden that you are very ladylike in appearance but i can hardly be expected to admit into my house in the important position of governess to my child the daughter or niece of an applewoman
did mrs leighton say that i was related to an applewoman
yes miss linden
i own i was surprised
it is not true mrs
cole
you live in the house of such a person do you not
yes she is an humble friend of mine and has been kind to me
you cannot be very fastidious
however that is your own affair
i am sorry to disappoint you miss linden but it will be quite impossible for me to employ you
then i will bid you goodmorning mrs cole said florence sore at heart
goodmorning
you will i think understand my position
if you applied for a position in one of the public schools i don't think that your residence would be an objection
florence left the house sad and despondent
she saw that mrs leighton by her unfriendly representations would prevent her from getting any opportunity to teach
she must seek some more humble employment
well florence did you get a place
asked mrs o'keefe as she passed that lady's stand
no mrs o'keefe answered florence wearily
and why not
did the woman think you didn't know enough
she objected to me because i was not living in a fashionable quarter at least that was one of her objections
i'm sure you've got a nate clane home and it looks as nate as wax all the time
it isn't exactly stylish said florence with a faint smile
you are at any rate
what does the woman want i'd like to know
she doesn't want me
it seems mrs leighton did not speak very highly of me
the trollop
i'd like to give her a box on the ear drat her impudence
said the irate applewoman
and what will you be doin' now
do you think i can get some sewing to do mrs
o'keefe
yes miss florencei'll get you some vests to make but it's hard work and poor pay
i must take what i can get sighed florence
i cannot choose
if you'd only tend an applestand miss florence
there's mrs brady wants to sell out on account of the rheumatics and i've got a trifle in the savings bankenough to buy it
you'd make a dollar a day easy
it isn't to be thought of mrs o'keefe
if you will kindly see about getting me some sewing i will see how i can get along
the result was that mrs o'keefe brought florence in the course of the day half a dozen vests for which she was to be paid the munificent sum of twentyfive cents each
florence had very little idea of what she was undertaking
she was an expert needlewoman and proved adequate to the work but with her utmust industry she could only make one vest in a day and that would barely pay her rent
true she had some money laid aside on which she could draw but that would soon be expended and then what was to become of her
shure i won't let you starve florence said the warmhearted applewoman
but mrs o'keefe i can't consent to live on you
and why not
i'm well and strong and i'm makin' more money than i nade
i couldn't think of it though i thank you for your kindness
shure you might write a letter to your uncle florence
he would expect me in that case to consent to a marriage with curtis
you wouldn't advise me to do that
no he's a mane blackguard and i'd say it to his face
weeks rolled by and florence began to show the effects of hard work and confinement
she grew pale and thin and her face was habitually sad
she had husbanded her savings as a governess as closely as she could but in spite of all her economy it dwindled till she had none left
henceforth she must depend on twentyfive cents a day and this seemed wellnigh impossible
in this emergency the pawnbroker occurred to her
she had a variety of nice dresses and she had also a handsome ring given her by her uncle on her last birthday
this she felt sure must have cost fifty dollars
it was a trial to part with it but there seemed to be no alternative
if my uncle has withdrawn his affection from me she said to herself why should i scruple to pawn the ring
it is the symbol of a love that no longer exists
so she entered the pawnbrowker'sthe first that attracted her attentionand held out the ring
how much will you lend me on this
she asked half frightened at finding herself in such a place
the pawnbroker examined it carefully
his practiced eye at once detected its value but it was not professional to admit this
rings is a drug in the market young lady he said
i've got more than i know what to do with
i'll give you fourfour dollars
four dollars
repeated florence in dismay
why it must have cost fifty
it was bought in tiffany's
you are mistaken my dear
did you buy it yourself there
no my uncle gave it to me
he may have said he paid fifty dollars for it said the pawnbroker wagging his head but we know better
but what will you give
asked florence desperately
i'll give you five dollars and not a penny more said the broker surveying her distressed face shrewdly
you can take it or not
what could florence do
she must have money and feared that no other pawnbroker would give her more
make out the ticket then she said wearily with a sigh
this was done and she left the place half timid half ashamed and wholly discouraged
but the darkest hour is sometimes nearest the dawn
a great overwhelming surprise awaited her
she had scarcely left the shop when a glad voice cried i have found you at last florence
she looked up and sawdodger
but not the old dodger
she saw a nicely dressed young gentleman larger than the friend she had parted with six months before with a brighter more intelligent and manly look
dodger
she faltered
yes it is dodger
where did you come from
from san francisco
but what have you been doing there
and dodger pointed in the direction of the pawnbroker's shop
i pawned my ring
then i shall get it back at once
how much did you get on it
five dollars
give me the ticket and go in with me
the pawnbroker was very reluctant to part with the ring which he made sure would not be reclaimed but there was no help for it
as they emerged into the street dodger said i've come back to restore you to your rights and give curtis waring the most disagreeable surprise he ever had
come home and i'll tell you all about it
i've struck luck florence and you're going to share it
chapter xxxvi
mrs o'keefe in a new role
no time was lost in seeing bolton and arranging a plan of campaign
curtis waring nearing the accomplishment of his plans was far from anticipating impending disaster
his uncle's health had become so poor and his strength had been so far undermined that it was thought desirable to employ a sick nurse
an advertisement was inserted in a morning paper which luckily attracted the attention of bolton
you must go mrs o'keefe he said to the applewoman
it is important that we have some one in the housesome friend of florence and the boyto watch what is going on
bridget o'keefe is no fool
leave her to manage
the result was that among a large number of applicants mrs o'keefe was selected by curtis as mr linden's nurse as she expressed herself willing to work for four dollars a week while the lowest outside demand was seven
we will now enter the house in which the last scenes of our story are to take place
mr linden weak and emaciated was sitting in an easychair in his library
how do you feel this morning uncle
asked curtis entering the room
i am very weak curtis
i don't think i shall ever be any better
i have engaged a nurse uncle as you desired and i expect her this morning
that is well curtis
i do not wish to confine you to my bedside
the nurse is below said jane the servant entering
send her up
mrs o'keefe entered in the sober attire of a nurse
she dropped a curtsey
are you the nurse i engaged
said curtis
yes sir
your name please
mrs barnes sir
have you experience as a nurse
plenty sir
uncle this is mrs barnes your new nurse
i hope you will find her satisfactory
she looks like a good woman said mr linden feebly
i think she will suit me
indade sir i'll try
uncle said curtis i have to go downtown
i have some business to attend to
i leave you in the care of mrs
barnes
shure i'll take care of him sir
is there anything i can do for you mr
linden
asked the new nurse in a tone of sympathy
can you minister to a mind diseased
i'll take the best care of you mr linden but it isn't as if you had a wife or daughter
ah that is a sore thought
i have no wife or daughter but i have a niece
and where is she sir
i don't know
i drove her from me by my unkindness
i repent bitterly but it's now too late
and why don't you send for her to come home
i would gladly do so but i don't know where she is
curtis has tried to find her but in vain
he says she is in chicago
and what should take her to chicago
he says she is there as a governess in a family
by the brow of st
patrick
thought mrs o'keefe if that curtis isn't a naturalborn liar
i'm sure she'd come back if you'd send for her sir said she aloud
do you think so
asked linden eagerly
i'm sure of it
but i don't know where to send
i know of a party that would be sure to find her
who is it
it's a young man
they call him dodger
if any one can find miss florence he can
you know my niece's name
i have heard it somewhere
from mr waring i think
and you think this young man would agree to go to chicago and find her
yes sir i make bold to say he will
tell him to go at once
he will need money
in yonder desk you will find a picture of my niece and a roll of bills
give them to him and send him at once
yes sir i will
but if you'll take my advice you won't say anything to mr curtis
he might think it foolish
true
if your friend succeeds we'll give curtis a surprise
and a mighty disagreeable one i'll be bound soliloquized mrs o'keefe
i think mrs barnes i will retire to my chamber if you will assist me
she assisted mr linden to his room and then returned to the library
mrs barnes there's a young man inquiring for you said jane entering
send him in jane
the visitor was dodger neatly dressed
how are things going mrs
o'keefe
he asked
splendid dodger
here's some money for you
what for
you're to go to chicago and bring back florence
but she isn't there
nivir mind
you're to pretend to go
but that won't take money
give it to florence then
it's hers by rights
won't we give curtis a surprise
where's his wife
i have found a comfortable boarding house for her
when had we better carry out this programme
she's very anxious to see her husband
the more fool she
kape her at home and out of his sight or there's no knowin' what he'll do
and dodger dear kape an eye on the applestand
i mistrust mrs burke that's runnin' it
i will
does the old gentleman seem to be very sick
he's wake as a rat
curtis would kill him soon if we didn't interfere
but we'll soon circumvent him the snake in the grass
miss florence will soon come to her own and curtis waring will be out in the cold
the most i have against him is that he tried to marry florence when he had a wife already
he's as bad as they make 'em dodger
it won't be my fault if mr linden's eyes are not opened to his wickedness
chapter xxxvii
the diplomacy of mrs o'keefe
mrs o'keefe was a warmhearted woman and the sad drawn face of mr linden appealed to her pity
why should i let the poor man suffer when i can relieve him
she asked herself
so the next morning after curtis had according to his custom gone downtown being in the invalid's sick chamber she began to act in a mysterious manner
she tiptoed to the door closed it and approached mr linden's bedside with the air of one about to unfold a strange story
whist now she said with her finger on her lips
what is the matter
asked the invalid rather alarmed
can you bear a surprise sir
have you any bad news for me
no it's good news but you must promise not to tell curtis
is it about florence
your messenger can hardly have reached chicago
he isn't going there sir
but you promised that he should said mr linden disturbed
i'll tell you why sir
florence is not in chicago
ii don't understand
you said she was there
begging your pardon sir it was curtis that said so though he knew she was in new york
but what motive could he have had for thus misrepresenting matters
he doesn't want you to take her back
i can't believe you mrs barnes
he loves her and wants to marry her
he couldn't marry her if she consented to take him
why not
mrs barnes you confuse me
i won't deceive you as he has done
there's rason in plinty
he's married already
is this true
demanded mr linden in excitement
it's true enough more by token tomorrow whin he's out his wife will come here and tell you so herself
but who are you who seem to know so much about my family
i'm a friend of the pore girl you've driven from the house because she would not marry a rascally spalpeen that's been schemin' to get your property into his hands
you're a friend of florence
where is she
she's in my house and has been there ever since she left her home
is shewell
as well as she can be whin she's been workin' her fingers to the bone wid sewin' to keep from starvin'
my god
what have i done
you've let curtis waring wind you around his little fingerthat's what you've done mr
linden
how soon can i see florence
how soon can you bear it
the sooner the better
then it'll be tomorrow i'm thinkin' that is if you won't tell curtis
no no i promise
i'll manage everything sir
don't worry now
mr linden's face lost its anxious lookso that when later in the day curtis looked into the room he was surprised
my uncle looks better he said
yes sir answered the nurse
i've soothed him like
indeed
you seem to be a very accomplished nurse
faith that i am sir though it isn't i that should say it
may i ask how you soothed him
inquired curtis anxiously
i told him that miss florence would soon be home
i do not think it right to hold out hopes that may prove illfounded
i know what i am about mr
curtis
i dare say you understand your business mrs barnes but if my uncle should be disappointed i am afraid the consequences will be lamentable
do you think he'll live long sir
curtis shrugged his shoulders
it is very hard to tell
my uncle is a very feeble man
and if he dies i suppose the property goes to you
i suppose so
but where does florence come in
it seems to me mrs barnes that you take a good deal of interest in our family affairs said curtis suspiciously
that's true sir
why shouldn't i take an interest in a nice gentleman like you
curtis smiled
i am doing my best to find florence
then our marriage will take place and it matters little to whom the property is left
but i thought miss florence didn't care to marry you
it is only because she thinks cousins ought not to marry
it's a foolish fancy and she'll get over it
thrue for you sir
my first husband was my cousin and we always agreed barrin' an occasional fight i don't think florence and i will ever fight mrs
barnes
what surprises me mr curtis is that a nicelookin' gentleman like you hasn't been married before
curtis eyed her keenly but her face told him nothing
i never saw one i wanted to marry till my cousin grew up he said
i belave in marryin' meself
i was first married at sivinteen
how long ago was that mrs
barnes
it's long ago mr curtis
i'm an old woman now
i was thirtyfive last birthday
curtis came near laughing outright for he suspectedwhat was true that the nurse would never see her fiftieth birthday again
then you are just my age he said
if i make him laugh he won't suspect nothing soliloquized the wily nurse
that's a pretty big lie even for me
shure i look older mr curtis she said aloud
what wid the worry of losin' two fond husbands i look much older than you
oh your are very well preserved mrs
barnes
curtis went into his uncle's chamber
how are you feeling uncle
he asked
i think i am better answered mr linden coldly for he had not forgotten mrs barnes' revelations
that is right
only make an effort and you will soon be strong again
i think i may
i may live ten years to annoy you
i fervently hope so said curtis but there was a false ring in his voice that his uncle detected
how do you like the new nurse
she is helping me wonderfully
you made a good selection
i will see that she is soon discharged curtis inwardly resolved
if her being here is to prolong my uncle's life and keep me still waiting for the estate i must clear the house of her
you must not allow her to buoy you up with unfounded hopes
she has been telling you that florence will soon return
yes she seems convinced of it
of course she knows nothing of it
she may return but i doubt whether she is in chicago now
i think the family she was with has gone to europe
where did you hear that curtis
asked mr linden with unwonted sharpness
i have sources of information which at present i do not care to impart
rest assured that i am doing all i can to get her back
you still want to marry her curtis
i do most certainly
i shall not insist upon it
i should not have done so before
have you changed your mind uncle
yes i have made a mistake and i have decided to correct it
what has come over him
curtis asked himself
some influence hostile to me has been brought to bear
it must be that nurse
i will quietly dismiss her tomorrow paying her a week's wages in lieu of warning
she's evidently a meddler
chapter xxxviii
the closing scene
the next day tim bolton dressed in a jaunty style walked up the steps of the linden mansion
is mr waring at home
he asked
no sir he has gone downtown
i'll step in and wait for him
please show me to the library
jane who had been taken into confidence by the nurse showed him at once into the room mentioned
half an hour later curtis entered
how long have you been here bolton
but a short time
you sent for me
i did
on business
well yes
is there anything new
yes my uncle is failing fast
is he likely to die soon
i shouldn't be surprised if he died within a week
i suspect curtis means to help him
well what has that to do with me
he asked
you will step into the property of course
there is a little difficulty in the way which i can overcome with your help
what is it
i can't get him to give up the foolish notion that the boy he lost is still alive
it happens to be true
yes but he must not know it
before he dies i want him to make a new will revoking all others leaving all the property to me
will he do it
i don't know
as long as he thinks the boy is living i don't believe he will
you see what a drawback that is
i see
what can i do to improve the situation
i want you to sign a paper confessing that you abducted the boy at your instigation
that must not be mentioned
you will go on to say that a year or two laterthe time is not materialhe died of typhoid fever
you can say that you did not dare to reveal this before but do so now impelled by remorse
have you got it written out
i can't remember all them words
yes here it is
all right said bolton taking the paper and tucking it into an inside pocket
i'll copy it out in my own handwriting
how much are you going to give me for doing this
a thousand dollars
cash
i can't do that
i have met with losses at the gaming table and i don't dare ask money from my uncle at this time
he thinks i am thoroughly steady
at how much do you value the estate
at four hundred thousand dollars
i wormed it out of my uncle's lawyer the other day
and you expect me to help you to that amount for only a thousand dollars
a thousand dollars is a good deal of money
and so is four hundred thousand
after all your uncle may not die
he is sure to
you seem very confident
and with good reason
leave that to me
i promise you on my honor to pay you two thousand dollars when i get the estate
but what is going to happen to poor dodger the rightful heir
well let it be three hundred dollars a year then
where is he now
i don't mind telling you as it can do no harm
he is in california
whew
that was smart
how did you get him there
i drugged him and had him sent on board a ship bound for san francisco around cape horn
the fact is i was getting a little suspicious of you and i wanted to put you beyond the reach of temptation
you are a clever rascal curtis
after all suppose the prize should slip through your fingers
it won't
i have taken every precaution
when do you want this document
bring it back to me this afternoon copied and signed
that is all you have to do i will attend to the rest
while this conversation was going on there were unseen listeners
behind a portiere mrs barnes the nurse and john linden heard every word that was said
and what do you think now sir
whispered mrs o'keefe to give her real name
it is terrible
i would not have believed curtis capable of such a crime
but is it really true mrs barnes
is my lost boy alive
to be sure he is
have you seen him
i know him as well as i know you sir and better too
is hetell me is he a good boy
curtis told me that he might be a criminal
he might but he isn't
he's as dacent and honest a boy as iver trod shoe leather
you'll be proud of him sir
but he's in california
he was but he's got back
you shall see him today and florence too
hark
i hear the door bell
they're here now
i think you had better go in and confront curtis
i feel weak mrs barnes
let me lean on you
you can do that and welcome sir
the nurse pushed aside the portiere and the two entered the library mrs barnes rotund and smiling mr linden gaunt and spectral looking like one risen from the grave
curtis eyed the pair with a startled look
mrs barnes he said angrily what do you mean by taking my uncle from his bed and bringing him down here
it is as much as his life is worth
you seem unfit for your duties as nurse
you will leave the house tomorrow and i will engage a substitute
i shall lave whin i git ready mr curtis waring said the nurse her arms akimbo
maybe somebody else will lave the house
me and mr linden have been behind the curtain for twenty minutes and he has heard every word you said
curtis turned livid and his heart sank
it's true curtis said john linden's hollow voice
i have heard all
it was you who abducted my boy and have made my life a lonely one all these years
oh man
man
how could you have the heart to do it
curtis stared at him with parched lips unable to speak
not content with this you drove from the house my dear niece florence
you made me act cruelly toward her
i fear she will not forgive me
but just then the door opened and florence rushing into the room sank at her uncle's feet
oh uncle she said will you take me back
yes florence never again to leave me
and who is this
he asked fixing his eyes on dodger who stood shyly in the doorway
i'll tell you sir said tim bolton
that is your own son whom i stole away from you when he was a kid being hired to do it by curtis waring
it's a lie said curtis hoarsely
come to me my boy said mr linden with a glad light in his eyes
at last heaven has heard my prayers he ejaculated
we will never be separated
i was ready to die but now i hope to live for many years
i feel that i have a new lease of life
with a baffled growl curtis waring darted a furious look at the three
that boy is an impostor he said
they are deceiving you
he is my son
i see his mother's look in his face
as for you curtis waring my eyes are open at last to your villainy
you deserve nothing at my hands but i will make some provision for you
there was another surprise
curtis waring's deserted wife brought from california by dodger entered the room leading by the hand a young child
oh curtis she said reproachfully
how could you leave me
i have come to you my husband with our little child
begone
woman
said curtis furiously
i will never receive or recognize you
oh sir
she said turning to mr linden what shall i do
curtis waring said mr linden sternly unless you receive this woman and treat her properly you shall receive nothing from me
and if i do
you will receive an income of two thousand dollars a year payable quarterly
mrs waring you will remain here with your child till your husband provides another home for you
curtis slunk out of the room but he was too wise to refuse his uncle's offer
he and his wife are living in chicago and he treats her fairly well fearing that otherwise he will lose his income
mr linden looks ten years younger than he did at the opening of the story
florence and dodgernow known as harvey lindenlive with him
dodger under a competent private tutor is making up the deficiencies in his education
it is early yet to speak of marriage but it is possible that florence may marry a cousin after all
tim bolton has turned over a new leaf given up his saloon and is carrying on a country hotel within fifty miles of new york
he has five thousand dollars in the bank presented by dodger with his father's sanction and is considered quite a reputable citizen
as for mrs o'keefe she still keeps the applestand being unwilling to give it up but she too has a handsome sum in the bank and calls often upon her two children as she calls them
in the midst of their prosperity florence and dodger will never forget the time when they were adrift in new york

ragged dick or street life in new york with the bootblacks
by horatio alger jr
contents preface to joseph w allen at whose suggestion this story was undertaken it is inscribed with friendly regard
preface ragged dick was contributed as a serial story to the pages of the schoolmate a wellknown juvenile magazine during the year
while in course of publication it was received with so many evidences of favor that it has been rewritten and considerably enlarged and is now presented to the public as the first volume of a series intended to illustrate the life and experiences of the friendless and vagrant children who are now numbered by thousands in new york and other cities
several characters in the story are sketched from life
the necessary information has been gathered mainly from personal observation and conversations with the boys themselves
the author is indebted also to the excellent superintendent of the newsboys lodging house in fulton street for some facts of which he has been able to make use
some anachronisms may be noted
wherever they occur they have been admitted as aiding in the development of the story and will probably be considered as of little importance in an unpretending volume which does not aspire to strict historical accuracy
the author hopes that while the volumes in this series may prove interesting stories they may also have the effect of enlisting the sympathies of his readers in behalf of the unfortunate children whose life is described and of leading them to cooperate with the praiseworthy efforts now making by the childrens aid society and other organizations to ameliorate their condition
new york april ragged dick is introduced to the reader wake up there youngster said a rough voice
ragged dick opened his eyes slowly and stared stupidly in the face of the speaker but did not offer to get up
wake up you young vagabond said the man a little impatiently i suppose youd lay there all day if i hadnt called you what time is it asked dick
seven oclock seven oclock
i oughterve been up an hour ago
i know what twas made me so precious sleepy
i went to the old bowery last night and didnt turn in till past twelve you went to the old bowery
whered you get your money asked the man who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on spruce street
made it by shines in course
my guardian dont allow me no money for theatres so i have to earn it some boys get it easier than that said the porter significantly
you dont catch me stealin if thats what you mean said dick
dont you ever steal then no and i wouldnt
lots of boys does it but i wouldnt well im glad to hear you say that
i believe theres some good in you dick after all oh im a rough customer said dick
but i wouldnt steal
its mean im glad you think so dick and the rough voice sounded gentler than at first
have you got any money to buy your breakfast no but ill soon get some while this conversation had been going on dick had got up
his bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw on which the young bootblack had reposed his weary limbs and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down
he dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing
getting up too was an equally short process
he jumped out of the box shook himself picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes and drawing a wellworn cap over his uncombed locks he was all ready for the business of the day
dicks appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar
his pants were torn in several places and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself
he wore a vest all the buttons of which were gone except two out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month
to complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him dating back if one might judge from its general appearance to a remote antiquity
washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day but dick was above such refinement
he had no particular dislike to dirt and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands
but in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about dick that was attractive
it was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly goodlooking
some of his companions were sly and their faces inspired distrust but dick had a frank straightforward manner that made him a favorite
dicks business hours had commenced
he had no office to open
his little blackingbox was ready for use and he looked sharply in the faces of all who passed addressing each with shine yer boots sir how much asked a gentleman on his way to his office
ten cents said dick dropping his box and sinking upon his knees on the sidewalk flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession
ten cents
isnt that a little steep well you know taint all clear profit said dick who had already set to work
theres the blacking costs something and i have to get a new brush pretty often and you have a large rent too said the gentleman quizzically with a glance at a large hole in dicks coat
yes sir said dick always ready to joke i have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on fifth avenoo that i cant afford to take less than ten cents a shine
ill give you a bully shine sir be quick about it for i am in a hurry
so your house is on fifth avenue is it it isnt anywhere else said dick and dick spoke the truth there
what tailor do you patronize asked the gentleman surveying dicks attire
would you like to go to the same one asked dick shrewdly
well no it strikes me that he didnt give you a very good fit this coat once belonged to general washington said dick comically
he wore it all through the revolution and it got torn some cause he fit so hard
when he died he told his widder to give it to some smart young feller that hadnt got none of his own so she gave it to me
but if youd like it sir to remember general washington by ill let you have it reasonable thank you but i wouldnt want to deprive you of it
and did your pants come from general washington too no they was a gift from lewis napoleon
lewis had outgrown em and sent em to mehes bigger than me and thats why they dont fit it seems you have distinguished friends
now my lad i suppose you would like your money i shouldnt have any objection said dick
i believe said the gentleman examining his pocketbook i havent got anything short of twentyfive cents
have you got any change not a cent said dick
all my moneys invested in the erie railroad thats unfortunate shall i get the money changed sir i cant wait ive got to meet an appointment immediately
ill hand you twentyfive cents and you can leave the change at my office any time during the day all right sir
where is it no
fulton street
shall you remember yes sir
what name greysonoffice on second floor all right sir ill bring it i wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest said mr greyson to himself as he walked away
if he does ill give him my custom regularly
if he dont as is most likely i shant mind the loss of fifteen cents mr greyson didnt understand dick
our ragged hero wasnt a model boy in all respects
i am afraid he swore sometimes and now and then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the city
a clergyman in search of the cooper institute he once directed to the tombs prison and following him unobserved was highly delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps of the great stone building on centre street and tried to obtain admission
i guess he wouldnt want to stay long if he did get in thought ragged dick hitching up his pants
leastways i shouldnt
theyre so precious glad to see you that they wont let you go but board you gratooitous and never send in no bills another of dicks faults was his extravagance
being always wideawake and ready for business he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably
there were not a few young clerks who employed dick from time to time in his professional capacity who scarcely earned as much as he greatly as their style and dress exceeded his
but dick was careless of his earnings
where they went he could hardly have told himself
however much he managed to earn during the day all was generally spent before morning
he was fond of going to the old bowery theatre and to tony pastors and if he had any money left afterwards he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oysterstew so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny
then i am sorry to add that dick had formed the habit of smoking
this cost him considerable for dick was rather fastidious about his cigars and wouldnt smoke the cheapest
besides having a liberal nature he was generally ready to treat his companions
but of course the expense was the smallest objection
no boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously
men are frequently injured by smoking and boys always
but large numbers of the newsboys and bootblacks form the habit
exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up and the selfindulgence grows upon them
it is not uncommon to see a little boy too young to be out of his mothers sight smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker
there was another way in which dick sometimes lost money
there was a noted gamblinghouse on baxter street which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters who staked their hard earnings generally losing of course and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass
sometimes dick strayed in here and played with the rest
i have mentioned dicks faults and defects because i want it understood to begin with that i dont consider him a model boy
but there were some good points about him nevertheless
he was above doing anything mean or dishonorable
he would not steal or cheat or impose upon younger boys but was frank and straightforward manly and selfreliant
his nature was a noble one and had saved him from all mean faults
i hope my young readers will like him as i do without being blind to his faults
perhaps although he was only a bootblack they may find something in him to imitate
and now having fairly introduced ragged dick to my young readers i must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures
johnny nolan after dick had finished polishing mr greysons boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers two of them reporters in the tribune establishment which occupies the corner of spruce street and printing house square
when dick had got through with his last customer the city hall clock indicated eight oclock
he had been up an hour and hard at work and naturally began to think of breakfast
he went up to the head of spruce street and turned into nassau
two blocks further and he reached ann street
on this street was a small cheap restaurant where for five cents dick could get a cup of coffee and for ten cents more a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in
these dick ordered and sat down at a table
it was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular
our heros breakfast was soon before him
neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at delmonicos but then it is very doubtful whether in the present state of his wardrobe dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged
dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door looking wistfully into the restaurant
this was johnny nolan a boy of fourteen who was engaged in the same profession as ragged dick
his wardrobe was in very much the same condition as dicks
had your breakfast johnny inquired dick cutting off a piece of steak
no come in then
heres room for you i aint got no money said johnny looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend
havent you had any shines yes i had one but i shant get any pay till tomorrow are you hungry try me and see come in
ill stand treat this morning johnny nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation and was soon seated beside dick
whatll you have johnny same as you cup o coffee and beefsteak ordered dick
these were promptly brought and johnny attacked them vigorously
now in the bootblacking business as well as in higher avocations the same rule prevails that energy and industry are rewarded and indolence suffers
dick was energetic and on the alert for business but johnny the reverse
the consequence was that dick earned probably three times as much as the other
how do you like it asked dick surveying johnnys attacks upon the steak with evident complacency
its hunky i dont believe hunky is to be found in either websters or worcesters big dictionary but boys will readily understand what it means
do you come here often asked johnny
most every day
youd better come too i cant afford it well youd ought to then said dick
what do you do id like to know i dont get near as much as you dick well you might if you tried
i keep my eyes openthats the way i get jobs
youre lazy thats whats the matter johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge
probably he felt the justice of it and preferred to proceed with the breakfast which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing
breakfast over dick walked up to the desk and settled the bill
then followed by johnny he went out into the street
where are you going johnny up to mr taylors on spruce street to see if he dont want a shine do you work for him reglar yes
him and his partner wants a shine most every day
where are you goin down front of the astor house
i guess ill find some customers there at this moment johnny started and dodging into an entry way hid behind the door considerably to dicks surprise
whats the matter now asked our hero
has he gone asked johnny his voice betraying anxiety
who gone id like to know that man in the brown coat what of him
you aint scared of him are you yes he got me a place once where ever so far off what if he did i ran away didnt you like it no i had to get up too early
it was on a farm and i had to get up at five to take care of the cows
i like new york best didnt they give you enough to eat oh yes plenty and you had a good bed yes then youd better have stayed
you dont get either of them here
whered you sleep last night up an alley in an old wagon you had a better bed than that in the country didnt you yes it was as soft asas cotton johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton the recollection supplying him with a comparison
why didnt you stay i felt lonely said johnny
johnny could not exactly explain his feelings but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets though his food is uncertain and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life that he feels discontented in any other
he is accustomed to the noise and bustle and evervaried life of the streets and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt
johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city
he had a father living but he might as well have been without one
mr nolan was a confirmed drunkard and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor
his potations made him ugly and inflamed a temper never very sweet working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that johnnys life was in danger
some months before he had thrown a flatiron at his sons head with such terrific force that unless johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story
he fled the house and from that time had not dared to reenter it
somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking and he had set up in business on his own account
but he had not energy enough to succeed as has already been stated and i am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships and suffered more than once from cold and hunger
dick had befriended him more than once and often given him a breakfast or dinner as the case might be
howd you get away asked dick with some curiosity
did you walk no i rode on the cars whered you get your money
i hope you didnt steal it i didnt have none what did you do then i got up about three oclock and walked to albany wheres that asked dick whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague
up the river how far about a thousand miles said johnny whose conceptions of distance were equally vague
go ahead
what did you do then i hid on top of a freight car and came all the way without their seeing me
that man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place and im afraid hed want to send me back a fact
well said dick reflectively i dunno as id like to live in the country
i couldnt go to tony pastors or the old bowery
there wouldnt be no place to spend my evenings
but i say its tough in winter johnny specially when your overcoats at the tailors an likely to stay there thats so dick
but i must be goin or mr taylorll get somebody else to shine his boots johnny walked back to nassau street while dick kept on his way to broadway
that boy soliloquized dick as johnny took his departure aint got no ambition
ill bet he wont get five shines today
im glad i aint like him
i couldnt go to the theatre nor buy no cigars nor get half as much as i wanted to eatshine yer boots sir dick always had an eye to business and this remark was addressed to a young man dressed in a stylish manner who was swinging a jaunty cane
ive had my boots blacked once already this morning but this confounded mud has spoiled the shine ill make em all right sir in a minute go ahead then the boots were soon polished in dicks best style which proved very satisfactory our hero being a proficient in the art
i havent got any change said the young man fumbling in his pocket but heres a bill you may run somewhere and get changed
ill pay you five cents extra for your trouble he handed dick a twodollar bill which our hero took into a store close by
will you please change that sir said dick walking up to the counter
the salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill and slightly glancing at it exclaimed angrily be off you young vagabond or ill have you arrested whats the row youve offered me a counterfeit bill i didnt know it said dick
dont tell me
be off or ill have you arrested dick makes a proposition though dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit he stood his ground bravely
clear out of this shop you young vagabond repeated the clerk
then give me back my bill that you may pass it again
no sir i shall do no such thing it doesnt belong to me said dick
a gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change a likely story said the clerk but he seemed a little uneasy
ill go and call him said dick
he went out and found his late customer standing on the astor house steps
well youngster have you brought back my change
you were a precious long time about it
i began to think you had cleared out with the money that aint my style said dick proudly
then wheres the change i havent got it wheres the bill then i havent got that either you young rascal hold on a minute mister said dick and ill tell you all about it
the man what took the bill said it wasnt good and kept it the bill was perfectly good
so he kept it did he
ill go with you to the store and see whether he wont give it back to me dick led the way and the gentleman followed him into the store
at the reappearance of dick in such company the clerk flushed a little and looked nervous
he fancied that he could browbeat a ragged bootblack but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter
he did not seem to notice the newcomers but began to replace some goods on the shelves
now said the young man point out the clerk that has my money thats him said dick pointing out the clerk
the gentleman walked up to the counter
i will trouble you he said a little haughtily for a bill which that boy offered you and which you still hold in your possession it was a bad bill said the clerk his cheek flushing and his manner nervous
it was no such thing
i require you to produce it and let the matter be decided the clerk fumbled in his vestpocket and drew out a badlooking bill
this is a bad bill but it is not the one i gave the boy it is the one he gave me the young man looked doubtful
boy he said to dick is this the bill you gave to be changed no it isnt you lie you young rascal exclaimed the clerk who began to find himself in a tight place and could not see the way out
this scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store and the proprietor walked up from the lower end where he had been busy
whats all this mr hatch he demanded
that boy said the clerk came in and asked change for a bad bill
i kept the bill and told him to clear out
now he wants it again to pass on somebody else show the bill the merchant looked at it
yes thats a bad bill he said
there is no doubt about that but it is not the one the boy offered said dicks patron
it is one of the same denomination but on a different bank do you remember what bank it was on it was on the merchants bank of boston are you sure of it i am perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other you may search me if you want to said dick indignantly
he doesnt look as if he was likely to have any extra bills
i suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill and has substituted the counterfeit note
it is a nice little scheme of his for making money i havent seen any bill on the merchants bank said the clerk doggedly
you had better feel in your pockets this matter must be investigated said the merchant firmly
if you have the bill produce it i havent got it said the clerk but he looked guilty notwithstanding
i demand that he be searched said dicks patron
i tell you i havent got it shall i send for a police officer mr hatch or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly said the merchant
alarmed at the threat implied in these words the clerk put his hand into his vestpocket and drew out a twodollar bill on the merchants bank
is this your note asked the shopkeeper showing it to the young man
it is i must have made a mistake faltered the clerk
i shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ said the merchant sternly
you may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you
i shall have no further occasion for your services now youngster said dicks patron as they went out of the store after he had finally got the bill changed
i must pay you something extra for your trouble
heres fifty cents thank you sir said dick
youre very kind
dont you want some more bills changed not today said he with a smile
its too expensive im in luck thought our hero complacently
i guess ill go to barnums tonight and see the bearded lady the eightfoot giant the twofoot dwarf and the other curiosities too numerous to mention dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the astor house
he took his station on the sidewalk and began to look about him
just behind him were two personsone a gentleman of fifty the other a boy of thirteen or fourteen
they were speaking together and dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said
i am sorry frank that i cant go about and show you some of the sights of new york but i shall be full of business today
it is your first visit to the city too yes sir theres a good deal worth seeing here
but im afraid youll have to wait to next time
you can go out and walk by yourself but dont venture too far or you will get lost frank looked disappointed
i wish tom miles knew i was here he said
he would go around with me where does he live somewhere up town i believe then unfortunately he is not available
if you would rather go with me than stay here you can but as i shall be most of the time in merchantscountingrooms i am afraid it would not be very interesting i think said frank after a little hesitation that i will go off by myself
i wont go very far and if i lose my way i will inquire for the astor house yes anybody will direct you here
very well frank i am sorry i cant do better for you oh never mind uncle i shall be amused in walking around and looking at the shopwindows
there will be a great deal to see now dick had listened to all this conversation
being an enterprising young man he thought he saw a chance for a speculation and determined to avail himself of it
accordingly he stepped up to the two just as franks uncle was about leaving and said i know all about the city sir ill show him around if you want me to the gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him
so you are a city boy are you yes sir said dick ive lived here ever since i was a baby and you know all about the public buildings i suppose yes sir and the central park yes sir
i know my way all round the gentleman looked thoughtful
i dont know what to say frank he remarked after a while
it is rather a novel proposal
he isnt exactly the sort of guide i would have picked out for you
still he looks honest
he has an open face and i think can be depended upon i wish he wasnt so ragged and dirty said frank who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion
im afraid you havent washed your face this morning said mr whitney for that was the gentlemans name
they didnt have no washbowls at the hotel where i stopped said dick
what hotel did you stop at the box hotel the box hotel yes sir i slept in a box on spruce street frank surveyed dick curiously
how did you like it he asked
i slept bully suppose it had rained then id have wet my best clothes said dick
are these all the clothes you have yes sir mr whitney spoke a few words to frank who seemed pleased with the suggestion
follow me my lad he said
dick in some surprise obeyed orders following mr whitney and frank into the hotel past the office to the foot of the staircase
here a servant of the hotel stopped dick but mr whitney explained that he had something for him to do and he was allowed to proceed
they entered a long entry and finally paused before a door
this being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed
come in my lad said mr whitney
dick and frank entered
dicks new suit now said mr whitney to dick my nephew here is on his way to a boardingschool
he has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn
he is willing to give them to you
i think they will look better than those you have on dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say
presents were something that he knew very little about never having received any to his knowledge
that so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful
the clothes were brought out and turned out to be a neat gray suit
before you put them on my lad you must wash yourself
clean clothes and a dirty skin dont go very well together
frank you may attend to him
i am obliged to go at once
have you got as much money as you require yes uncle one more word my lad said mr whitney addressing dick i may be rash in trusting a boy of whom i know nothing but i like your looks and i think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew yes i will sir said dick earnestly
honor bright very well
a pleasant time to you the process of cleansing commenced
to tell the truth dick needed it and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant
frank added to his gift a shirt stockings and an old pair of shoes
i am sorry i havent any cap said he
ive got one said dick
it isnt so new as it might be said frank surveying an old felt hat which had once been black but was now dingy with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off
no said dick my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy and ive kep it ever since out of respect for his memory
but ill get a new one now
i can buy one cheap on chatham street is that near here only five minutes walk then we can get one on the way when dick was dressed in his new attire with his face and hands clean and his hair brushed it was difficult to imagine that he was the same boy
he now looked quite handsome and might readily have been taken for a young gentleman except that his hands were red and grimy
look at yourself said frank leading him before the mirror
by gracious said dick starting back in astonishment that isnt me is it dont you know yourself asked frank smiling
it reminds me of cinderella said dick when she was changed into a fairy princess
i see it one night at barnums
whatll johnny nolan say when he sees me
he wont dare to speak to such a young swell as i be now
aint it rich and dick burst into a loud laugh
his fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friends surprise
then the thought of the valuable gifts he had received occurred to him and he looked gratefully at frank
youre a brick he said
a what a brick
youre a jolly good fellow to give me such a present youre quite welcome dick said frank kindly
im better off than you are and i can spare the clothes just as well as not
you must have a new hat though
but that we can get when we go out
the old clothes you can make into a bundle wait a minute till i get my handkercher and dick pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag which might have been white once though it did not look like it and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt
you mustnt carry that said frank
but ive got a cold said dick
oh i dont mean you to go without a handkerchief
ill give you one frank opened his trunk and pulled out two which he gave to dick
i wonder if i aint dreamin said dick once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass
im afraid im dreamin and shall wake up in a barrel as i did night afore last shall i pinch you so you can wake here asked frank playfully
yes said dick seriously i wish you would he pulled up the sleeve of his jacket and frank pinched him pretty hard so that dick winced
yes i guess im awake said dick youve got a pair of nippers you have
but what shall i do with my brush and blacking he asked
you can leave them here till we come back said frank
they will be safe hold on a minute said dick surveying franks boots with a professional eye you aint got a good shine on them boots
ill make em shine so you can see your face in em and he was as good as his word
thank you said frank now you had better brush your own shoes this had not occurred to dick for in general the professional bootblack considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair
the two boys now went downstairs together
they met the same servant who had spoken to dick a few minutes before but there was no recognition
he dont know me said dick
he thinks im a young swell like you whats a swell oh a feller that wears nobby clothes like you and you too dick yes said dick whod ever have thought as i should have turned into a swell they had now got out on broadway and were slowly walking along the west side by the park when who should dick see in front of him but johnny nolan
instantly dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing johnnys amazement at his change in appearance
he stole up behind him and struck him on the back
hallo johnny how many shines have you had johnny turned round expecting to see dick whose voice he recognized but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy the hat alone excepted who looked indeed like dick but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity
what luck johnny repeated dick
johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment
who be you he said
well thats a good one laughed dick so you dont know dick whered you get all them clothes asked johnny
have you been stealin say that again and ill lick you
no ive lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin to a party and didnt have none fit to wear and so i put on my secondbest for a change without deigning any further explanation dick went off followed by the astonished gaze of johnny nolan who could not quite make up his mind whether the neatlooking boy he had been talking with was really ragged dick or not
in order to reach chatham street it was necessary to cross broadway
this was easier proposed than done
there is always such a throng of omnibuses drays carriages and vehicles of all kinds in the neighborhood of the astor house that the crossing is formidable to one who is not used to it
dick made nothing of it dodging in and out among the horses and wagons with perfect selfpossession
reaching the opposite sidewalk he looked back and found that frank had retreated in dismay and that the width of the street was between them
come across called out dick
i dont see any chance said frank looking anxiously at the prospect before him
im afraid of being run over if you are you can sue em for damages said dick
finally frank got safely over after several narrow escapes as he considered them
is it always so crowded he asked
a good deal worse sometimes said dick
i knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross and at last got run over by an omnibus leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children
his widder a beautiful young woman was obliged to start a peanut and apple stand
there she is now where dick pointed to a hideous old woman of large proportions wearing a bonnet of immense size who presided over an applestand close by
frank laughed
if that is the case he said i think i will patronize her leave it to me said dick winking
he advanced gravely to the applestand and said old lady have you paid your taxes the astonished woman opened her eyes
im a govment officer said dick sent by the mayor to collect your taxes
ill take it in apples just to oblige
that big red one will about pay what youre owin to the govment i dont know nothing about no taxes said the old woman in bewilderment
then said dick ill let you off this time
give us two of your best apples and my friend here the president of the common council will pay you frank smiling paid three cents apiece for the apples and they sauntered on dick remarking if these apples aint good old lady well return em and get our money back this would have been rather difficult in his case as the apple was already half consumed
chatham street where they wished to go being on the east side the two boys crossed the park
this is an enclosure of about ten acres which years ago was covered with a green sward but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings
dick pointed out the city hall the hall of records and the rotunda
the former is a white building of large size and surmounted by a cupola
thats where the mayors office is said dick
him and me are very good friends
i once blacked his boots by particlar appointment
thats the way i pay my city taxes chatham street and broadway they were soon in chatham street walking between rows of readymade clothing shops many of which had half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk
the proprietors of these establishments stood at the doors watching attentively the passersby extending urgent invitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter
walk in young gentlemen said a stout man at the entrance of one shop
no i thank you replied dick as the fly said to the spider were selling off at less than cost of course you be
thats where you makes your money said dick
there aint nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any profit on his goods the chatham street trader looked after our hero as if he didnt quite comprehend him but dick without waiting for a reply passed on with his companion
in some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on
i am only offered two dollars gentlemen for this elegant pair of doeskin pants made of the very best of cloth
its a frightful sacrifice
wholl give an eighth
thank you sir
only seventeen shillings
why the cloth cost more by the yard this speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three men holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in the legs and presenting a cheap bowery look
frank and dick paused before the shop door and finally saw them knocked down to rather a verdantlooking individual at three dollars
clothes seem to be pretty cheap here said frank
yes but baxter street is the cheapest place is it yes
johnny nolan got a whole rigout there last week for a dollarcoat cap vest pants and shoes
they was very good measure too like my best clothes that i took off to oblige you i shall know where to come for clothes next time said frank laughing
i had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country
i suppose the baxter street tailors are fashionable in course they are
me and horace greeley always go there for clothes
when horace gets a new suit i always have one made just like it but i cant go the white hat
it aint becomin to my style of beauty a little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk distributing small printed handbills
one was handed to frank which he read as follows grand closingout salea variety of beautiful and costly articles for sale at a dollar apiece
unparalleled inducements
walk in gentlemen whereabouts is this sale asked frank
in here young gentlemen said a blackwhiskered individual who appeared suddenly on the scene
walk in shall we go in dick its a swindlin shop said dick in a low voice
ive been there
that mans a regular cheat
hes seen me before but he dont know me coz of my clothes step in and see the articles said the man persuasively
you neednt buy you know are all the articles worth moren a dollar asked dick
yes said the other and some worth a great deal more such as what well theres a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars and you sell it for a dollar
thats very kind of you said dick innocently
walk in and youll understand it no i guess not said dick
my servants is so dishonest that i wouldnt like to trust em with a silver pitcher
come along frank
i hope youll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin the public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they are worth how does he manage dick asked frank as they went on
all his articles are numbered and he makes you pay a dollar and then shakes some dice and whatever the figgers come to is the number of the article you draw
most of em aint worth sixpence a hat and cap store being close at hand dick and frank went in
for seventyfive cents which frank insisted on paying dick succeeded in getting quite a neatlooking cap which corresponded much better with his appearance than the one he had on
the last not being considered worth keeping dick dropped on the sidewalk from which on looking back he saw it picked up by a brother bootblack who appeared to consider it better than his own
they retraced their steps and went up chambers street to broadway
at the corner of broadway and chambers street is a large white marble warehouse which attracted franks attention
what building is that he asked with interest
that belongs to my friend a t stewart said dick
its the biggest store on broadway
if i ever retire from bootblackin and go into mercantile pursuits i may buy him out or build another store thatll take the shine off this one mr stewarts tenth street store was not open at the time dick spoke
were you ever in the store asked frank
no said dick but im intimate with one of stewarts partners
he is a cash boy and does nothing but take money all day a very agreeable employment said frank laughing
yes said dick id like to be in it the boys crossed to the west side of broadway and walked slowly up the street
to frank it was a very interesting spectacle
accustomed to the quiet of the country there was something fascinating in the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks and the great variety of vehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street
then again the shopwindows with their multifarious contents interested and amused him and he was constantly checking dick to look in at some wellstocked window
i dont see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy of them he said
we havent got but two stores in our village and broadway seems to be full of them yes said dick and its pretty much the same in the avenoos specially the third sixth and eighth avenoos
the bowery too is a great place for shoppin
there everybody sells cheapern anybody else and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods wheres barnums museum asked frank
oh thats down nearly opposite the astor house said dick
didnt you see a great building with lots of flags yes well thats barnums
thats where the happy family live and the lions and bears and curiosities generally
its a tiptop place
havent you ever been there
its most as good as the old bowery only the plays isnt quite so excitin since destroyed by fire and rebuilt farther up broadway and again burned down in february
ill go if i get time said frank
there is a boy at home who came to new york a month ago and went to barnums and has been talking about it ever since so i suppose it must be worth seeing theyve got a great play at the old bowery now pursued dick
tis called the demon of the danube the demon falls in love with a young woman and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep rock where his castle stands thats a queer way of showing his love said frank laughing
she didnt want to go with him you know but was in love with another chap
when he heard about his girl bein carried off he felt awful and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free
well at last he got into the castle by some underground passage and he and the demon had a fight
oh it was bully seein em roll round on the stage cuttin and slashin at each other and which got the best of it at first the demon seemed to be ahead but at last the young baron got him down and struck a dagger into his heart sayin die false and perjured villain
the dogs shall feast upon thy carcass and then the demon give an awful howl and died
then the baron seized his body and threw it over the precipice it seems to me the actor who plays the demon ought to get extra pay if he has to be treated that way thats so said dick but i guess hes used to it
it seems to agree with his constitution what building is that asked frank pointing to a structure several rods back from the street with a large yard in front
it was an unusual sight for broadway all the other buildings in that neighborhood being even with the street
that is the new york hospital said dick
theyre a rich institution and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms did you ever go in there yes said dick there was a friend of mine johnny mullen he was a newsboy got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin broadway down near park place
he was carried to the hospital and me and some of his friends paid his board while he was there
it was only three dollars a week which was very cheap considerin all the care they took of him
i got leave to come and see him while he was here
everything looked so nice and comfortable that i thought a little of coaxin a omnibus driver to run over me so i might go there too did your friend have to have his leg cut off asked frank interested
no said dick though there was a young student there that was very anxious to have it cut off but it wasnt done and johnny is around the streets as well as ever while this conversation was going on they reached no
at the corner of franklin street
now the office of the merchants union express company
thats taylors saloon said dick
when i come into a fortun i shall take my meals there reglar i have heard of it very often said frank
it is said to be very elegant
suppose we go in and take an icecream
it will give us a chance to see it to better advantage thank you said dick i think thats the most agreeable way of seein the place myself the boys entered and found themselves in a spacious and elegant saloon resplendent with gilding and adorned on all sides by costly mirrors
they sat down to a small table with a marble top and frank gave the order
it reminds me of aladdins palace said frank looking about him
does it said dick he must have had plenty of money he had an old lamp which he had only to rub when the slave of the lamp would appear and do whatever he wanted that must have been a valooable lamp
id be willin to give all my erie shares for it there was a tall gaunt individual at the next table who apparently heard this last remark of dicks
turning towards our hero he said may i inquire young man whether you are largely interested in this erie railroad i havent got no property except whats invested in erie said dick with a comical sideglance at frank
indeed
i suppose the investment was made by your guardian no said dick i manage my property myself and i presume your dividends have not been large why no said dick youre about right there
they havent as i supposed
its poor stock
now my young friend i can recommend a much better investment which will yield you a large annual income
i am agent of the excelsior copper mining company which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world
its sure to yield fifty per cent
on the investment
now all you have to do is to sell out your erie shares and invest in our stock and ill insure you a fortune in three years
how many shares did you say you had i didnt say that i remember said dick
your offer is very kind and obligin and as soon as i get time ill see about it i hope you will said the stranger
permit me to give you my card
samuel snap no
wall street i shall be most happy to receive a call from you and exhibit the maps of our mine
i should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends
i am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise very good said dick
here the stranger left the table and walked up to the desk to settle his bill
you see what it is to be a man of fortun frank said dick and wear good clothes
i wonder what that chapll say when he sees me blackin boots tomorrow in the street perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does after all said frank
some of these mining companies are nothing but swindles got up to cheat people out of their money hes welcome to all he gets out of me said dick
up broadway to madison square as the boys pursued their way up broadway dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement
frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the st nicholas and metropolitan hotels the former of white marble the latter of a subdued brown hue but not less elegant in its internal appointments
he was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars
at eighth street dick turned to the right and pointed out the clinton hall building now occupied by the mercantile library comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes
now not far from one hundred thousand
a little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of third and fourth avenues and with one side on each
what is that building asked frank
thats the cooper institute said dick built by mr cooper a particular friend of mine
me and peter cooper used to go to school together what is there inside asked frank
theres a hall for public meetins and lectures in the basement and a readin room and a picture gallery up above said dick
directly opposite cooper institute frank saw a very large building of brick covering about an acre of ground
is that a hotel he asked
no said dick thats the bible house
its the place where they make bibles
i was in there oncesaw a big pile of em did you ever read the bible asked frank who had some idea of the neglected state of dicks education
no said dick ive heard its a good book but i never read one
i aint much on readin
it makes my head ache i suppose you cant read very fast i can read the little words pretty well but the big ones is what stick me if i lived in the city you might come every evening to me and i would teach you would you take so much trouble about me asked dick earnestly
certainly i should like to see you getting on
there isnt much chance of that if you dont know how to read and write youre a good feller said dick gratefully
i wish you did live in new york
id like to know somethin
whereabouts do you live about fifty miles off in a town on the left bank of the hudson
i wish youd come up and see me sometime
i would like to have you come and stop two or three days honor bright i dont understand do you mean it asked dick incredulously
of course i do
why shouldnt i what would your folks say if they knowed you asked a bootblack to visit you you are none the worse for being a bootblack dick i aint used to genteel society said dick
i shouldnt know how to behave then i could show you
you wont be a bootblack all your life you know no said dick im goin to knock off when i get to be ninety before that i hope said frank smiling
i really wish i could get somethin else to do said dick soberly
id like to be a office boy and learn business and grow up spectable why dont you try and see if you cant get a place dick whod take ragged dick but you aint ragged now dick no said dick i look a little better than i did in my washington coat and louis napoleon pants
but if i got in a office they wouldnt give me moren three dollars a week and i couldnt live spectable on that no i suppose not said frank thoughtfully
but you would get more at the end of the first year yes said dick but by that time id be nothin but skin and bones frank laughed
that reminds me he said of the story of an irishman who out of economy thought he would teach his horse to feed on shavings
so he provided the horse with a pair of green spectacles which made the shavings look eatable
but unfortunately just as the horse got learned he up and died the hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur by the time he got through remarked dick
whereabouts are we now asked frank as they emerged from fourth avenue into union square
that is union park said dick pointing to a beautiful enclosure in the centre of which was a pond with a fountain playing
is that the statue of general washington asked frank pointing to a bronze equestrian statue on a granite pedestal
yes said dick hes growed some since he was president
if hed been as tall as that when he fit in the revolution hed have walloped the britishers some i reckon frank looked up at the statue which is fourteen and a half feet high and acknowledged the justice of dicks remark
how about the coat dick he asked
would it fit you well it might be rather loose said dick i aint much moren ten feet high with my boots off no i should think not said frank smiling
youre a queer boy dick well ive been brought up queer
some boys is born with a silver spoon in their mouth
victorias boys is born with a gold spoon set with dimonds but gold and silver was scarce when i was born and mine was pewter perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by dick
did you ever hear of dick whittington never did
was he a ragged dick i shouldnt wonder if he was
at any rate he was very poor when he was a boy but he didnt stay so
before he died he became lord mayor of london did he asked dick looking interested
how did he do it why you see a rich merchant took pity on him and gave him a home in his own house where he used to stay with the servants being employed in little errands
one day the merchant noticed dick picking up pins and needles that had been dropped and asked him why he did it
dick told him he was going to sell them when he got enough
the merchant was pleased with his saving disposition and when soon after he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts he told dick he might send anything he pleased in it and it should be sold to his advantage
now dick had nothing in the world but a kitten which had been given him a short time before how much taxes did he have to pay on it asked dick
not very high probably
but having only the kitten he concluded to send it along
after sailing a good many months during which the kitten grew up to be a strong cat the ship touched at an island never before known which happened to be infested with rats and mice to such an extent that they worried everybodys life out and even ransacked the kings palace
to make a long story short the captain seeing how matters stood brought dicks cat ashore and she soon made the rats and mice scatter
the king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice and resolved to have her at any price
so he offered a great quantity of gold for her which of course the captain was glad to accept
it was faithfully carried back to dick and laid the foundation of his fortune
he prospered as he grew up and in time became a very rich merchant respected by all and before he died was elected lord mayor of london thats a pretty good story said dick but i dont believe all the cats in new york will ever make me mayor no probably not but you may rise in some other way
a good many distinguished men have once been poor boys
theres hope for you dick if youll try nobody ever talked to me so before said dick
they just called me ragged dick and told me id grow up to be a vagabone boys who are better educated need not be surprised at dicks blunders and come to the gallows telling you so wont make it turn out so dick
if youll try to be somebody and grow up into a respectable member of society you will
you may not become richit isnt everybody that becomes rich you knowbut you can obtain a good position and be respected ill try said dick earnestly
i neednt have been ragged dick so long if i hadnt spent my money in goin to the theatre and treatin boys to oysterstews and bettin money on cards and such like have you lost money that way lots of it
one time i saved up five dollars to buy me a new rigout cos my best suit was all in rags when limpy jim wanted me to play a game with him limpy jim said frank interrogatively
yes hes lame thats what makes us call him limpy jim i suppose you lost yes i lost every penny and had to sleep out cos i hadnt a cent to pay for lodgin
twas a awful cold night and i got most froze wouldnt jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging no i axed him for five cents but he wouldnt let me have it can you get lodging for five cents asked frank in surprise
yes said dick but not at the fifth avenue hotel
thats it right out there the pocketbook they had reached the junction of broadway and of fifth avenue
before them was a beautiful park of ten acres
on the lefthand side was a large marble building presenting a fine appearance with its extensive white front
this was the building at which dick pointed
is that the fifth avenue hotel asked frank
ive heard of it often
my uncle william always stops there when he comes to new york i once slept on the outside of it said dick
they was very reasonable in their charges and told me i might come again perhaps sometime youll be able to sleep inside said frank
i guess thatll be when queen victoria goes to the five points to live it looks like a palace said frank
the queen neednt be ashamed to live in such a beautiful building as that though frank did not know it one of the queens palaces is far from being as fine a looking building as the fifth avenue hotel
st james palace is a very uglylooking brick structure and appears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty
there are few hotels in the world as finelooking as this democratic institution
at that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk who looked back at dick as if his face seemed familiar
i know that man said dick after he had passed
hes one of my customers what is his name i dont know he looked back as if he thought he knew you he would have knowed me at once if it hadnt been for my new clothes said dick
i dont look much like ragged dick now i suppose your face looked familiar all but the dirt said dick laughing
i dont always have the chance of washing my face and hands in the astor house you told me said frank that there was a place where you could get lodging for five cents
wheres that its the newsboys lodgin house on fulton street said dick up over the sun office
its a good place
i dont know what us boys would do without it
they give you supper for six cents and a bed for five cents more i suppose some boys dont even have the five cents to paydo they theyll trust the boys said dick
but i dont like to get trusted
id be ashamed to get trusted for five cents or ten either
one night i was comin down chatham street with fifty cents in my pocket
i was goin to get a good oysterstew and then go to the lodgin house but somehow it slipped through a hole in my trowsespocket and i hadnt a cent left
if it had been summer i shouldnt have cared but its rather tough stayin out winter nights frank who had always possessed a good home of his own found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home or money to procure the common comfort of a bed
what did you do he asked his voice full of sympathy
i went to the times office
i knowed one of the pressmen and he let me set down in a corner where i was warm and i soon got fast asleep why dont you get a room somewhere and so always have a home to go to i dunno said dick
i never thought of it
prhaps i may hire a furnished house on madison square thats where flora mcflimsey lived i dont know her said dick who had never read the popular poem of which she is the heroine
while this conversation was going on they had turned into twentyfifth street and had by this time reached third avenue
just before entering it their attention was drawn to the rather singular conduct of an individual in front of them
stopping suddenly he appeared to pick up something from the sidewalk and then looked about him in rather a confused way
i know his game whispered dick
come along and youll see what it is he hurried frank forward until they overtook the man who had come to a standstill
have you found anything asked dick
yes said the man ive found this he exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills to judge from its plethoric appearance
whew exclaimed dick youre in luck i suppose somebody has lost it said the man and will offer a handsome reward which youll get unfortunately i am obliged to take the next train to boston
thats where i live
i havent time to hunt up the owner then i suppose youll take the pocketbook with you said dick with assumed simplicity
i should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it returned to the owner said the man glancing at the boys
im honest said dick
ive no doubt of it said the other
well young man ill make you an offer
you take the pocketbook all right
hand it over then wait a minute
there must be a large sum inside
i shouldnt wonder if there might be a thousand dollars
the owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward why dont you stay and get it asked frank
i would only there is sickness in my family and i must get home as soon as possible
just give me twenty dollars and ill hand you the pocketbook and let you make whatever you can out of it
come thats a good offer
what do you say dick was well dressed so that the other did not regard it as at all improbable that he might possess that sum
he was prepared however to let him have it for less if necessary
twenty dollars is a good deal of money said dick appearing to hesitate
youll get it back and a good deal more said the stranger persuasively
i dont know but i shall
what would you do frank i dont know but i would said frank if youve got the money he was not a little surprised to think that dick had so much by him
i dont know but i will said dick after some irresolution
i guess i wont lose much you cant lose anything said the stranger briskly
only be quick for i must be on my way to the cars
i am afraid i shall miss them now dick pulled out a bill from his pocket and handed it to the stranger receiving the pocketbook in return
at that moment a policeman turned the corner and the stranger hurriedly thrusting the bill into his pocket without looking at it made off with rapid steps
what is there in the pocketbook dick asked frank in some excitement
i hope theres enough to pay you for the money you gave him dick laughed
ill risk that said he
but you gave him twenty dollars
thats a good deal of money if i had given him as much as that i should deserve to be cheated out of it but you diddidnt you he thought so what was it then it was nothing but a drygoods circular got up to imitate a bankbill frank looked sober
you ought not to have cheated him dick he said reproachfully
didnt he want to cheat me i dont know what do you spose there is in that pocketbook asked dick holding it up
frank surveyed its ample proportions and answered sincerely enough money and a good deal of it there aint stamps enough in it to buy a oysterstew said dick
if you dont believe it just look while i open it so saying he opened the pocketbook and showed frank that it was stuffed out with pieces of blank paper carefully folded up in the shape of bills
frank who was unused to city life and had never heard anything of the dropgame looked amazed at this unexpected development
i knowed how it was all the time said dick
i guess i got the best of him there
this wallets worth somethin
i shall use it to keep my stiffkits of erie stock in and all my other papers what aint of no use to anybody but the owner thats the kind of papers its got in it now said frank smiling
thats so said dick
by hokey he exclaimed suddenly if there aint the old chap comin back agin
he looks as if hed heard bad news from his sick family by this time the pocketbook dropper had come up
approaching the boys he said in an undertone to dick give me back that pocketbook you young rascal beg your pardon mister said dick but was you addressin me yes i was cause you called me by the wrong name
ive knowed some rascals but i aint the honor to belong to the family he looked significantly at the other as he spoke which didnt improve the mans temper
accustomed to swindle others he did not fancy being practised upon in return
give me back that pocketbook he repeated in a threatening voice
couldnt do it said dick coolly
im gon to restore it to the owner
the contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick and hell be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder you gave me a bogus bill said the man
its what i use myself said dick
youve swindled me i thought it was the other way none of your nonsense said the man angrily
if you dont give up that pocketbook ill call a policeman i wish you would said dick
theyll know most likely whether its stewart or astor thats lost the pocketbook and i can get em to return it the dropper whose object it was to recover the pocketbook in order to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer was irritated by dicks refusal and above all by the coolness he displayed
he resolved to make one more attempt
do you want to pass the night in the tombs he asked
thank you for your very obligin proposal said dick but it aint convenient today
any other time when youd like to have me come and stop with you im agreeable but my two youngest children is down with the measles and i expect ill have to set up all night to take care of em
is the tombs in gineral a pleasant place of residence dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that frank could scarcely forbear laughing though it is hardly necessary to say that the dropper was by no means so inclined
youll know sometime he said scowling
ill make you a fair offer said dick
if i get moren fifty dollars as a reward for my honesty ill divide with you
but i say aint it most time to go back to your sick family in boston finding that nothing was to be made out of dick the man strode away with a muttered curse
you were too smart for him dick said frank
yes said dick i aint knocked round the city streets all my life for nothin dicks early history have you always lived in new york dick asked frank after a pause
ever since i can remember i wish youd tell me a little about yourself
have you got any father or mother i aint got no mother
she died when i wasnt but three years old
my father went to sea but he went off before mother died and nothin was ever heard of him
i expect he got wrecked or died at sea and what became of you when your mother died the folks she boarded with took care of me but they was poor and they couldnt do much
when i was seven the woman died and her husband went out west and then i had to scratch for myself at seven years old exclaimed frank in amazement
yes said dick i was a little feller to take care of myself but he continued with pardonable pride i did it what could you do sometimes one thing and sometimes another said dick
i changed my business accordin as i had to
sometimes i was a newsboy and diffused intelligence among the masses as i heard somebody say once in a big speech he made in the park
them was the times when horace greeley and james gordon bennett made money through your enterprise suggested frank
yes said dick but i give it up after a while what for well they didnt always put news enough in their papers and people wouldnt buy em as fast as i wanted em to
so one mornin i was stuck on a lot of heralds and i thought id make a sensation
so i called out great news
queen victoria assassinated all my heralds went off like hot cakes and i went off too but one of the gentlemen what got sold remembered me and said hed have me took up and thats what made me change my business that wasnt right dick said frank
i know it said dick but lots of boys does it that dont make it any better no said dick i was sort of ashamed at the time specially about one poor old gentlemana englishman he was
he couldnt help cryin to think the queen was dead and his hands shook when he handed me the money for the paper what did you do next i went into the match business said dick but it was small sales and small profits
most of the people i called on had just laid in a stock and didnt want to buy
so one cold night when i hadnt money enough to pay for a lodgin i burned the last of my matches to keep me from freezin
but it cost too much to get warm that way and i couldnt keep it up youve seen hard times dick said frank compassionately
yes said dick ive knowed what it was to be hungry and cold with nothin to eat or to warm me but theres one thing i never could do he added proudly
whats that i never stole said dick
its mean and i wouldnt do it were you ever tempted to lots of times
once i had been goin round all day and hadnt sold any matches except three cents worth early in the mornin
with that i bought an apple thinkin i should get some more bimeby
when evenin come i was awful hungry
i went into a bakers just to look at the bread
it made me feel kind o good just to look at the bread and cakes and i thought maybe they would give me some
i asked em wouldnt they give me a loaf and take their pay in matches
but they said theyd got enough matches to last three months so there wasnt any chance for a trade
while i was standin at the stove warmin me the baker went into a back room and i felt so hungry i thought i would take just one loaf and go off with it
there was such a big pile i dont think hed have known it but you didnt do it no i didnt and i was glad of it for when the man came in agin he said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in st marks place
his boy was sick and he hadnt no one to send so he told me hed give me ten cents if i would go
my business wasnt very pressin just then so i went and when i come back i took my pay in bread and cakes
didnt they taste good though so you didnt stay long in the match business dick no i couldnt sell enough to make it pay
then there was some folks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them so i couldnt make any profit
there was one old ladyshe was rich too for she lived in a big brick housebeat me down so that i didnt make no profit at all but she wouldnt buy without and i hadnt sold none that day so i let her have them
i dont see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin theres a good deal of meanness in the world im afraid dick if everybody was like you and your uncle said dick there would be some chance for poor people
if i was rich id try to help em along perhaps you will be rich sometime dick dick shook his head
im afraid all my wallets will be like this said dick indicating the one he had received from the dropper and will be full of papers what aint of no use to anybody except the owner that depends very much on yourself dick said frank
stewart wasnt always rich you know wasnt he when he first came to new york as a young man he was a teacher and teachers are not generally very rich
at last he went into business starting in a small way and worked his way up by degrees
but there was one thing he determined in the beginning that he would be strictly honorable in all his dealings and never overreach any one for the sake of making money
if there was a chance for him dick there is a chance for you he knowed enough to be a teacher and im awful ignorant said dick
but you neednt stay so how can i help it cant you learn at school i cant go to school cause ive got my livin to earn
it wouldnt do me much good if i learned to read and write and just as id got learned i starved to death but are there no nightschools yes why dont you go
i suppose you dont work in the evenings i never cared much about it said dick and thats the truth
but since ive got to talkin with you i think more about it
i guess ill begin to go i wish you would dick
youll make a smart man if you only get a little education do you think so asked dick doubtfully
i know so
a boy who has earned his own living since he was seven years old must have something in him
i feel very much interested in you dick
youve had a hard time of it so far in life but i think better times are in store
i want you to do well and i feel sure you can if you only try youre a good fellow said dick gratefully
im afraid im a pretty rough customer but i aint as bad as some
i mean to turn over a new leaf and try to grow up spectable thereve been a great many boys begin as low down as you dick that have grown up respectable and honored
but they had to work pretty hard for it im willin to work hard said dick
and you must not only work hard but work in the right way whats the right way you began in the right way when you determined never to steal or do anything mean or dishonorable however strongly tempted to do so
that will make people have confidence in you when they come to know you
but in order to succeed well you must manage to get as good an education as you can
until you do you cannot get a position in an office or countingroom even to run errands thats so said dick soberly
i never thought how awful ignorant i was till now that can be remedied with perseverance said frank
a year will do a great deal for you ill go to work and see what i can do said dick energetically
a scene in a third avenue car the boys had turned into third avenue a long street which commencing just below the cooper institute runs out to harlem
a man came out of a side street uttering at intervals a monotonous cry which sounded like glass puddin glass pudding repeated frank looking in surprised wonder at dick
what does he mean perhaps youd like some said dick
i never heard of it before suppose you ask him what he charges for his puddin frank looked more narrowly at the man and soon concluded that he was a glazier
oh i understand he said
he means glass put in franks mistake was not a singular one
the monotonous cry of these men certainly sounds more like glass puddin than the words they intend to utter
now said dick where shall we go i should like to see central park said frank
is it far off it is about a mile and a half from here said dick
this is twentyninth street and the park begins at fiftyninth street it may be explained for the benefit of readers who have never visited new york that about a mile from the city hall the crossstreets begin to be numbered in regular order
there is a continuous line of houses as far as one hundred and thirtieth street where may be found the terminus of the harlem line of horsecars
when the entire island is laid out and settled probably the numbers will reach two hundred or more
central park which lies between fiftyninth street on the south and one hundred and tenth street on the north is true to its name occupying about the centre of the island
the distance between two parallel streets is called a block and twenty blocks make a mile
it will therefore be seen that dick was exactly right when he said they were a mile and a half from central park
that is too far to walk said frank
twont cost but six cents to ride said dick
you mean in the horsecars yes all right then
well jump aboard the next car the third avenue and harlem line of horsecars is better patronized than any other in new york though not much can be said for the cars which are usually dirty and overcrowded
still when it is considered that only seven cents are charged for the entire distance to harlem about seven miles from the city hall the fare can hardly be complained of
but of course most of the profit is made from the waypassengers who only ride a short distance
a car was at that moment approaching but it seemed pretty crowded
shall we take that or wait for another asked frank
the nextll most likely be as bad said dick
the boys accordingly signalled to the conductor to stop and got on the front platform
they were obliged to stand up till the car reached fortieth street when so many of the passengers had got off that they obtained seats
frank sat down beside a middleaged woman or lady as she probably called herself whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to promise a very pleasant disposition
when the two gentlemen who sat beside her arose she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two seats
disregarding this the boys sat down
there aint room for two she said looking sourly at frank
there were two here before well there ought not to have been
some people like to crowd in where theyre not wanted and some like to take up a double allowance of room thought frank but he did not say so
he saw that the woman had a bad temper and thought it wisest to say nothing
frank had never ridden up the city as far as this and it was with much interest that he looked out of the car windows at the stores on either side
third avenue is a broad street but in the character of its houses and stores it is quite inferior to broadway though better than some of the avenues further east
fifth avenue as most of my readers already know is the finest street in the city being lined with splendid private residences occupied by the wealthier classes
many of the cross streets also boast houses which may be considered palaces so elegant are they externally and internally
frank caught glimpses of some of these as he was carried towards the park
after the first conversation already mentioned with the lady at his side he supposed he should have nothing further to do with her
but in this he was mistaken
while he was busy looking out of the car window she plunged her hand into her pocket in search of her purse which she was unable to find
instantly she jumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen and her suspicions fastened upon frank with whom she was already provoked for crowding her as she termed it
conductor she exclaimed in a sharp voice
whats wanted maam returned that functionary
i want you to come here right off whats the matter my purse has been stolen
there was four dollars and eighty cents in it
i know because i counted it when i paid my fare who stole it that boy she said pointing to frank who listened to the charge in the most intense astonishment
he crowded in here on purpose to rob me and i want you to search him right off thats a lie exclaimed dick indignantly
oh youre in league with him i dare say said the woman spitefully
youre as bad as he is ill be bound youre a nice female you be said dick ironically
dont you dare to call me a female sir said the lady furiously
why you aint a man in disguise be you said dick
you are very much mistaken madam said frank quietly
the conductor may search me if you desire it a charge of theft made in a crowded car of course made quite a sensation
cautious passengers instinctively put their hands on their pockets to make sure that they too had not been robbed
as for frank his face flushed and he felt very indignant that he should even be suspected of so mean a crime
he had been carefully brought up and been taught to regard stealing as low and wicked
dick on the contrary thought it a capital joke that such a charge should have been made against his companion
though he had brought himself up and known plenty of boys and men too who would steal he had never done so himself
he thought it mean
but he could not be expected to regard it as frank did
he had been too familiar with it in others to look upon it with horror
meanwhile the passengers rather sided with the boys
appearances go a great ways and frank did not look like a thief
i think you must be mistaken madam said a gentleman sitting opposite
the lad does not look as if he would steal you cant tell by looks said the lady sourly
theyre deceitful villains are generally well dressed be they said dick
youd ought to see me with my washington coat on
youd think i was the biggest villain ever you saw ive no doubt you are said the lady scowling in the direction of our hero
thank you maam said dick
tisnt often i get such fine compliments none of your impudence said the lady wrathfully
i believe youre the worst of the two meanwhile the car had been stopped
how long are we going to stop here demanded a passenger impatiently
im in a hurry if none of the rest of you are i want my pocketbook said the lady defiantly
well maam i havent got it and i dont see as its doing you any good detaining us all here conductor will you call a policeman to search that young scamp continued the aggrieved lady
you dont expect im going to lose my money and do nothing about it ill turn my pockets inside out if you want me to said frank proudly
theres no need of a policeman
the conductor or any one else may search me well youngster said the conductor if the lady agrees ill search you the lady signified her assent
frank accordingly turned his pockets inside out but nothing was revealed except his own portemonnaie and a penknife
well maam are you satisfied asked the conductor
no i aint said she decidedly
you dont think hes got it still no but hes passed it over to his confederate that boy there thats so full of impudence thats me said dick comically
he confesses it said the lady i want him searched all right said dick im ready for the operation only as ive got valooable property about me be careful not to drop any of my erie bonds the conductors hand forthwith dove into dicks pocket and drew out a rusty jackknife a battered cent about fifty cents in change and the capacious pocketbook which he had received from the swindler who was anxious to get back to his sick family in boston
is that yours maam asked the conductor holding up the wallet which excited some amazement by its size among the other passengers
it seems to me you carry a large pocketbook for a young man of your age said the conductor
thats what i carry my cash and valooable papers in said dick
i suppose that isnt yours maam said the conductor turning to the lady
no said she scornfully
i wouldnt carry round such a great wallet as that
most likely hes stolen it from somebody else what a prime detective youd be said dick
prhaps you know who i took it from i dont know but my moneys in it said the lady sharply
conductor will you open that wallet and see what there is in it dont disturb the valooable papers said dick in a tone of pretended anxiety
the contents of the wallet excited some amusement among the passengers
there dont seem to be much money here said the conductor taking out a roll of tissue paper cut out in the shape of bills and rolled up
no said dick
didnt i tell you them were papers of no valoo to anybody but the owner
if the ladyd like to borrow i wont charge no interest where is my money then said the lady in some discomfiture
i shouldnt wonder if one of the young scamps had thrown it out of the window youd better search your pocket once more said the gentleman opposite
i dont believe either of the boys is in fault
they dont look to me as if they would steal thank you sir said frank
the lady followed out the suggestion and plunging her hand once more into her pocket drew out a small portemonnaie
she hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry at this discovery
it placed her in rather an awkward position after the fuss she had made and the detention to which she had subjected the passengers now as it proved for nothing
is that the pocketbook you thought stolen asked the conductor
yes said she rather confusedly
then youve been keeping me waiting all this time for nothing he said sharply
i wish youd take care to be sure next time before you make such a disturbance for nothing
ive lost five minutes and shall not be on time i cant help it was the cross reply i didnt know it was in my pocket it seems to me you owe an apology to the boys you accused of a theft which they have not committed said the gentleman opposite
i shant apologize to anybody said the lady whose temper was not of the best least of all to such whippersnappers as they are thank you maam said dick comically your handsome apology is accepted
it aint of no consequence only i didnt like to expose the contents of my valooable pocketbook for fear it might excite the envy of some of my poor neighbors youre a character said the gentleman who had already spoken with a smile
a bad character muttered the lady
but it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were against the lady and on the side of the boys who had been falsely accused while dicks drollery had created considerable amusement
the cars had now reached fiftyninth street the southern boundary of the park and here our hero and his companion got off
youd better look out for pickpockets my lad said the conductor pleasantly
that big wallet of yours might prove a great temptation thats so said dick
thats the misfortin of being rich
astor and me dont sleep much for fear of burglars breakin in and robbin us of our valooable treasures
sometimes i think ill give all my money to an orphan asylum and take it out in board
i guess id make money by the operation while dick was speaking the car rolled away and the boys turned up fiftyninth street for two long blocks yet separated them from the park
introduces a victim of misplaced confidence what a queer chap you are dick said frank laughing
you always seem to be in good spirits no i aint always
sometimes i have the blues when well once last winter it was awful cold and there was big holes in my shoes and my gloves and all my warm clothes was at the tailors
i felt as if life was sort of tough and id like it if some rich man would adopt me and give me plenty to eat and drink and wear without my havin to look so sharp after it
then agin when ive seen boys with good homes and fathers and mothers ive thought id like to have somebody to care for me dicks tone changed as he said this from his usual levity and there was a touch of sadness in it
frank blessed with a good home and indulgent parents could not help pitying the friendless boy who had found life such uphill work
dont say you have no one to care for you dick he said lightly laying his hand on dicks shoulder
i will care for you will you if you will let me i wish you would said dick earnestly
id like to feel that i have one friend who cares for me central park was now before them but it was far from presenting the appearance which it now exhibits
it had not been long since work had been commenced upon it and it was still very rough and unfinished
a rough tract of land two miles and a half from north to south and a half a mile broad very rocky in parts was the material from which the park commissioners have made the present beautiful enclosure
there were no houses of good appearance near it buildings being limited mainly to rude temporary huts used by the workmen who were employed in improving it
the time will undoubtedly come when the park will be surrounded by elegant residences and compare favorably in this respect with the most attractive parts of any city in the world
but at the time when frank and dick visited it not much could be said in favor either of the park or its neighborhood
if this is central park said frank who naturally felt disappointed i dont think much of it
my fathers got a large pasture that is much nicer itll look better some time said dick
there aint much to see now but rocks
we will take a walk over it if you want to no said frank ive seen as much of it as i want to
besides i feel tired then well go back
we can take the sixth avenue cars
they will bring us out at vesey street just beside the astor house all right said frank
that will be the best course
i hope he added laughing our agreeable lady friend wont be there
i dont care about being accused of stealing again she was a tough one said dick
wouldnt she make a nice wife for a man that likes to live in hot water and didnt mind bein scalded two or three times a day yes i think shed just suit him
is that the right car dick yes jump in and ill follow the sixth avenue is lined with stores many of them of very good appearance and would make a very respectable principal street for a goodsized city
but it is only one of several long business streets which run up the island and illustrate the extent and importance of the city to which they belong
no incidents worth mentioning took place during their ride down town
in about threequarters of an hour the boys got out of the car beside the astor house
are you goin in now frank asked dick
that depends upon whether you have anything else to show me wouldnt you like to go to wall street thats the street where there are so many bankers and brokersisnt it yes i spose you aint afraid of bulls and bearsare you bulls and bears repeated frank puzzled
yes what are they the bulls is what tries to make the stocks go up and the bears is what try to growl em down oh i see
yes id like to go accordingly they walked down on the west side of broadway as far as trinity church and then crossing entered a street not very wide or very long but of very great importance
the reader would be astonished if he could know the amount of money involved in the transactions which take place in a single day in this street
it would be found that although broadway is much greater in length and lined with stores it stands second to wall street in this respect
what is that large marble building asked frank pointing to a massive structure on the corner of wall and nassau streets
it was in the form of a parallelogram two hundred feet long by ninety wide and about eighty feet in height the ascent to the entrance being by eighteen granite steps
thats the custom house said dick
it looks like pictures ive seen of the parthenon at athens said frank meditatively
wheres athens asked dick
it aint in york stateis it not the athens i mean at any rate
it is in greece and was a famous city two thousand years ago thats longer than i can remember said dick
i cant remember distinctly moren about a thousand years what a chap you are dick
do you know if we can go in the boys ascertained after a little inquiry that they would be allowed to do so
they accordingly entered the custom house and made their way up to the roof from which they had a fine view of the harbor the wharves crowded with shipping and the neighboring shores of long island and new jersey
towards the north they looked down for many miles upon continuous lines of streets and thousands of roofs with here and there a churchspire rising above its neighbors
dick had never before been up there and he as well as frank was interested in the grand view spread before them
at length they descended and were going down the granite steps on the outside of the building when they were addressed by a young man whose appearance is worth describing
he was tall and rather loosely put together with small eyes and rather a prominent nose
his clothing had evidently not been furnished by a city tailor
he wore a blue coat with brass buttons and pantaloons of rather scanty dimensions which were several inches too short to cover his lower limbs
he held in his hand a piece of paper and his countenance wore a look of mingled bewilderment and anxiety
be they apayin out money inside there he asked indicating the interior by a motion of his hand
i guess so said dick
are you agoin in for some wal yes
ive got an order here for sixty dollarsmade a kind of speculation this morning how was it asked frank
wal you see i brought down some money to put in the bank fifty dollars it was and i hadnt justly made up my mind what bank to put it into when a chap came up in a terrible hurry and said it was very unfortunate but the bank wasnt open and he must have some money right off
he was obliged to go out of the city by the next train
i asked him how much he wanted
he said fifty dollars
i told him id got that and he offered me a check on the bank for sixty and i let him have it
i thought that was a pretty easy way to earn ten dollars so i counted out the money and he went off
he told me id hear a bell ring when they began to pay out money
but ive waited most two hours and i haint heard it yet
id ought to be goin for i told dad id be home tonight
do you think i can get the money now will you show me the check asked frank who had listened attentively to the countrymans story and suspected that he had been made the victim of a swindler
it was made out upon the washington bank in the sum of sixty dollars and was signed ephraim smith washington bank repeated frank
dick is there such a bank in the city not as i knows on said dick
leastways i dont own any shares in it aint this the washington bank asked the countryman pointing to the building on the steps of which the three were now standing
no its the custom house and wont they give me any money for this asked the young man the perspiration standing on his brow
i am afraid the man who gave it to you was a swindler said frank gently
and wont i ever see my fifty dollars again asked the youth in agony
i am afraid not whatll dad say ejaculated the miserable youth
it makes me feel sick to think of it
i wish i had the feller here
id shake him out of his boots what did he look like
ill call a policeman and you shall describe him
perhaps in that way you can get track of your money dick called a policeman who listened to the description and recognized the operator as an experienced swindler
he assured the countryman that there was very little chance of his ever seeing his money again
the boys left the miserable youth loudly bewailing his bad luck and proceeded on their way down the street
hes a baby said dick contemptuously
hed ought to know how to take care of himself and his money
a feller has to look sharp in this city or hell lose his eyeteeth before he knows it i suppose you never got swindled out of fifty dollars dick no i dont carry no such small bills
i wish i did he added
so do i dick
whats that building there at the end of the street thats the wallstreet ferry to brooklyn how long does it take to go across not moren five minutes suppose we just ride over and back all right said dick
its rather expensive but if you dont mind i dont why how much does it cost two cents apiece i guess i can stand that
let us go they passed the gate paying the fare to a man who stood at the entrance and were soon on the ferryboat bound for brooklyn
they had scarcely entered the boat when dick grasping frank by the arm pointed to a man just outside of the gentlemens cabin
do you see that man frank he inquired
yes what of him hes the man that cheated the country chap out of his fifty dollars dick as a detective dicks ready identification of the rogue who had cheated the countryman surprised frank
what makes you think it is he he asked
because ive seen him before and i know hes up to them kind of tricks
when i heard how he looked i was sure i knowed him our recognizing him wont be of much use said frank
it wont give back the countryman his money i dont know said dick thoughtfully
may be i can get it how asked frank incredulously
wait a minute and youll see dick left his companion and went up to the man whom he suspected
ephraim smith said dick in a low voice
the man turned suddenly and looked at dick uneasily
what did you say he asked
i believe your name is ephraim smith continued dick
youre mistaken said the man and was about to move off
stop a minute said dick
dont you keep your money in the washington bank i dont know any such bank
im in a hurry young man and i cant stop to answer any foolish questions the boat had by this time reached the brooklyn pier and mr ephraim smith seemed in a hurry to land
look here said dick significantly youd better not go on shore unless you want to jump into the arms of a policeman what do you mean asked the man startled
that little affair of yours is known to the police said dick about how you got fifty dollars out of a greenhorn on a false check and it maynt be safe for you to go ashore i dont know what youre talking about said the swindler with affected boldness though dick could see that he was ill at ease
yes you do said dick
there isnt but one thing to do
just give me back that money and ill see that youre not touched
if you dont ill give you up to the first pliceman we meet dick looked so determined and spoke so confidently that the other overcome by his fears no longer hesitated but passed a roll of bills to dick and hastily left the boat
all this frank witnessed with great amazement not understanding what influence dick could have obtained over the swindler sufficient to compel restitution
how did you do it he asked eagerly
i told him id exert my influence with the president to have him tried by habeas corpus said dick
and of course that frightened him
but tell me without joking how you managed dick gave a truthful account of what occurred and then said now well go back and carry the money suppose we dont find the poor countryman then the plice will take care of it they remained on board the boat and in five minutes were again in new york
going up wall street they met the countryman a little distance from the custom house
his face was marked with the traces of deep anguish but in his case even grief could not subdue the cravings of appetite
he had purchased some cakes of one of the old women who spread out for the benefit of passersby an array of apples and seedcakes and was munching them with melancholy satisfaction
hilloa said dick
have you found your money no ejaculated the young man with a convulsive gasp
i shant ever see it again
the mean skunks cheated me out of it
consarn his picter
it took me most six months to save it up
i was workin for deacon pinkham in our place
oh i wish id never come to new york
the deacon he told me hed keep it for me but i wanted to put it in the bank and now its all gone boo hoo and the miserable youth having despatched his cakes was so overcome by the thought of his loss that he burst into tears
i say said dick dry up and see what ive got here the youth no sooner saw the roll of bills and comprehended that it was indeed his lost treasure than from the depths of anguish he was exalted to the most ecstatic joy
he seized dicks hand and shook it with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed for its safety
pears to me you take my arm for a pumphandle said he
couldnt you show your gratitood some other way
its just possible i may want to use my arm agin some time the young man desisted but invited dick most cordially to come up and stop a week with him at his country home assuring him that he wouldnt charge him anything for board
all right said dick
if you dont mind ill bring my wife along too
shes delicate and the country air might do her good jonathan stared at him in amazement uncertain whether to credit the fact of his marriage
dick walked on with frank leaving him in an apparent state of stupefaction and it is possible that he has not yet settled the affair to his satisfaction
now said frank i think ill go back to the astor house
uncle has probably got through his business and returned all right said dick
the two boys walked up to broadway just where the tall steeple of trinity faces the street of bankers and brokers and walked leisurely to the hotel
when they arrived at the astor house dick said goodby frank not yet said frank i want you to come in with me dick followed his young patron up the steps
frank went to the readingroom where as he had thought probable he found his uncle already arrived and reading a copy of the evening post which he had just purchased outside
well boys he said looking up have you had a pleasant jaunt yes sir said frank
dicks a capital guide so this is dick said mr whitney surveying him with a smile
upon my word i should hardly have known him
i must congratulate him on his improved appearance franks been very kind to me said dick who rough streetboy as he was had a heart easily touched by kindness of which he had never experienced much
hes a tiptop fellow i believe he is a good boy said mr whitney
i hope my lad you will prosper and rise in the world
you know in this free country poverty in early life is no bar to a mans advancement
i havent risen very high myself he added with a smile but have met with moderate success in life yet there was a time when i was as poor as you were you sir asked dick eagerly
yes my boy i have known the time i have been obliged to go without my dinner because i didnt have enough money to pay for it how did you get up in the world asked dick anxiously
i entered a printingoffice as an apprentice and worked for some years
then my eyes gave out and i was obliged to give that up
not knowing what else to do i went into the country and worked on a farm
after a while i was lucky enough to invent a machine which has brought me in a great deal of money
but there was one thing i got while i was in the printingoffice which i value more than money what was that sir a taste for reading and study
during my leisure hours i improved myself by study and acquired a large part of the knowledge which i now possess
indeed it was one of my books that first put me on the track of the invention which i afterwards made
so you see my lad that my studious habits paid me in money as well as in another way im awful ignorant said dick soberly
but you are young and i judge a smart boy
if you try to learn you can and if you ever expect to do anything in the world you must know something of books i will said dick resolutely
i aint always goin to black boots for a livin all labor is respectable my lad and you have no cause to be ashamed of any honest business yet when you can get something to do that promises better for your future prospects i advise you to do so
till then earn your living in the way you are accustomed to avoid extravagance and save up a little money if you can thank you for your advice said our hero
there aint many that takes an interest in ragged dick so thats your name said mr whitney
if i judge you rightly it wont be long before you change it
save your money my lad buy books and determine to be somebody and you may yet fill an honorable position ill try said dick
goodnight sir wait a minute dick said frank
your blackingbox and old clothes are upstairs
you may want them in course said dick
i couldnt get along without my best clothes and my stock in trade you may go up to the room with him frank said mr whitney
the clerk will give you the key
i want to see you dick before you go yes sir said dick
where are you going to sleep tonight dick asked frank as they went upstairs together
praps at the fifth avenue hotelon the outside said dick
havent you any place to sleep then i slept in a box last night in a box yes on spruce street poor fellow said frank compassionately
oh twas a bully bedfull of straw
i slept like a top dont you earn enough to pay for a room dick yes said dick only i spend my money foolish goin to the old bowery and tony pastors and sometimes gamblin in baxter street you wont gamble any morewill you dick said frank laying his hand persuasively on his companions shoulder
no i wont said dick
youll promise yes and ill keep it
youre a good feller
i wish you was goin to be in new york i am going to a boardingschool in connecticut
the name of the town is barnton
will you write to me dick my writing would look like hens tracks said our hero
never mind
i want you to write
when you write you can tell me how to direct and i will send you a letter i wish you would said dick
i wish i was more like you i hope you will make a much better boy dick
now well go in to my uncle
he wishes to see you before you go they went into the readingroom
dick had wrapped up his blackingbrush in a newspaper with which frank had supplied him feeling that a guest of the astor house should hardly be seen coming out of the hotel displaying such a professional sign
uncle dicks ready to go said frank
goodby my lad said mr whitney
i hope to hear good accounts of you sometime
dont forget what i have told you
remember that your future position depends mainly upon yourself and that it will be high or low as you choose to make it he held out his hand in which was a fivedollar bill
dick shrunk back
i dont like to take it he said
i havent earned it perhaps not said mr whitney but i give it to you because i remember my own friendless youth
i hope it may be of service to you
sometime when you are a prosperous man you can repay it in the form of aid to some poor boy who is struggling upward as you are now i will sir said dick manfully
he no longer refused the money but took it gratefully and bidding frank and his uncle goodby went out into the street
a feeling of loneliness came over him as he left the presence of frank for whom he had formed a strong attachment in the few hours he had known him
dick hires a room on mott street going out into the fresh air dick felt the pangs of hunger
he accordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper
perhaps it was the new clothes he wore which made him feel a little more aristocratic
at all events instead of patronizing the cheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals he went into the refectory attached to lovejoys hotel where the prices were higher and the company more select
in his ordinary dress dick would have been excluded but now he had the appearance of a very respectable gentlemanly boy whose presence would not discredit any establishment
his orders were therefore received with attention by the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him
i wish i could come here every day thought dick
it seems kind o nice and spectable side of the other place
theres a gent at that other table that ive shined boots for moren once
he dont know me in my new clothes
guess he dont know his bootblack patronizes the same establishment his supper over dick went up to the desk and presenting his check tendered in payment his fivedollar bill as if it were one of a large number which he possessed
receiving back his change he went out into the street
two questions now arose how should he spend the evening and where should he pass the night
yesterday with such a sum of money in his possession he would have answered both questions readily
for the evening he would have passed it at the old bowery and gone to sleep in any outoftheway place that offered
but he had turned over a new leaf or resolved to do so
he meant to save his money for some useful purposeto aid his advancement in the world
so he could not afford the theatre
besides with his new clothes he was unwilling to pass the night out of doors
i should spile em he thought and that wouldnt pay so he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly and consider as his own where he could sleep nights instead of depending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter
this would be the first step towards respectability and dick determined to take it
he accordingly passed through the city hall park and walked leisurely up centre street
he decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek lodgings in fifth avenue although his present cash capital consisted of nearly five dollars in money besides the valuable papers contained in his wallet
besides he had reason to doubt whether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic street
he took his way to mott street which is considerably less pretentious and halted in front of a shabby brick lodginghouse kept by a mrs mooney with whose son tom dick was acquainted
dick rang the bell which sent back a shrill metallic response
the door was opened by a slatternly servant who looked at him inquiringly and not without curiosity
it must be remembered that dick was well dressed and that nothing in his appearance bespoke his occupation
being naturally a goodlooking boy he might readily be mistaken for a gentlemans son
well queen victoria said dick is your missus at home my names bridget said the girl
oh indeed said dick
you looked so much like the queens picter what she gave me last christmas in exchange for mine that i couldnt help calling you by her name oh go along wid ye said bridget
its makin fun ye are if you dont believe me said dick gravely all youve got to do is to ask my particlar friend the duke of newcastle bridget called a shrill voice from the basement
the missus is calling me said bridget hurriedly
ill tell her ye want her all right said dick
the servant descended into the lower regions and in a short time a stout redfaced woman appeared on the scene
well sir whats your wish she asked
have you got a room to let asked dick
is it for yourself you ask questioned the woman in some surprise
dick answered in the affirmative
i havent got any very good rooms vacant
theres a small room in the third story id like to see it said dick
i dont know as it would be good enough for you said the woman with a glance at dicks clothes
i aint very particlar about accommodations said our hero
i guess ill look at it dick followed the landlady up two narrow staircases uncarpeted and dirty to the third landing where he was ushered into a room about ten feet square
it could not be considered a very desirable apartment
it had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet but this was now very ragged and looked worse than none
there was a single bed in the corner covered with an indiscriminate heap of bedclothing rumpled and not overclean
there was a bureau with the veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off and a small glass eight inches by ten cracked across the middle also two chairs in rather a disjointed condition
judging from dicks appearance mrs mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain
but it must be remembered that dicks past experience had not been of a character to make him fastidious
in comparison with a box or an empty wagon even this little room seemed comfortable
he decided to hire it if the rent proved reasonable
well whats the tax asked dick
i ought to have a dollar a week said mrs mooney hesitatingly
say seventyfive cents and ill take it said dick
every week in advance yes well as times is hard and i cant afford to keep it empty you may have it
when will you come tonight said dick
it aint lookin very neat
i dont know as i can fix it up tonight well ill sleep here tonight and you can fix it up tomorrow i hope youll excuse the looks
im a lone woman and my help is so shiftless i have to look after everything myself so i cant keep things as straight as i want to all right said dick
can you pay me the first week in advance asked the landlady cautiously
dick responded by drawing seventyfive cents from his pocket and placing it in her hand
whats your business sir if i may inquire said mrs mooney
oh im professional said dick
indeed said the landlady who did not feel much enlightened by this answer
hows tom asked dick
do you know my tom said mrs mooney in surprise
hes gone to seato californy
he went last week did he said dick
yes i knew him mrs mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor on finding that he was acquainted with her son who by the way was one of the worst young scamps in mott street which is saying considerable
ill bring over my baggage from the astor house this evening said dick in a tone of importance
from the astor house repeated mrs mooney in fresh amazement
yes ive been stoppin there a short time with some friends said dick
mrs mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that a guest from the astor house was about to become one of her lodgerssuch transfers not being common
did you say you was purfessional she asked
yes maam said dick politely
you aint aa mrs mooney paused uncertain what conjecture to hazard
oh no nothing of the sort said dick promptly
how could you think so mrs mooney no offence sir said the landlady more perplexed than ever
certainly not said our hero
but you must excuse me now mrs mooney as i have business of great importance to attend to youll come round this evening dick answered in the affirmative and turned away
i wonder what he is thought the landlady following him with her eyes as he crossed the street
hes got good clothes on but he dont seem very particular about his room
well ive got all my rooms full now
thats one comfort dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step of hiring a lodging and paying a weeks rent in advance
for seven nights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in
the thought was a pleasant one to our young vagrant who hitherto had seldom known when he rose in the morning where he should find a restingplace at night
i must bring my traps round said dick to himself
i guess ill go to bed early tonight
itll feel kinder good to sleep in a reglar bed
boxes is rather hard to the back and aint comfortable in case of rain
i wonder what johnny nolan would say if he knew id got a room of my own micky maguire about nine oclock dick sought his new lodgings
in his hands he carried his professional wardrobe namely the clothes which he had worn at the commencement of the day and the implements of his business
these he stowed away in the bureau drawers and by the light of a flickering candle took off his clothes and went to bed
dick had a good digestion and a reasonably good conscience consequently he was a good sleeper
perhaps too the soft feather bed conduced to slumber
at any rate his eyes were soon closed and he did not awake until halfpast six the next morning
he lifted himself on his elbow and stared around him in transient bewilderment
blest if i hadnt forgot where i was he said to himself
so this is my room is it
well it seems kind of spectable to have a room and a bed to sleep in
id orter be able to afford seventyfive cents a week
ive throwed away more money than that in one evenin
there aint no reason why i shouldnt live spectable
i wish i knowed as much as frank
hes a tiptop feller
nobody ever cared enough for me before to give me good advice
it was kicks and cuffs and swearin at me all the time
id like to show him i can do something while dick was indulging in these reflections he had risen from bed and finding an accession to the furniture of his room in the shape of an ancient washstand bearing a cracked bowl and broken pitcher indulged himself in the rather unusual ceremony of a good wash on the whole dick preferred to be clean but it was not always easy to gratify his desire
lodging in the street as he had been accustomed to do he had had no opportunity to perform his toilet in the customary manner
even now he found himself unable to arrange his dishevelled locks having neither comb nor brush
he determined to purchase a comb at least as soon as possible and a brush too if he could get one cheap
meanwhile he combed his hair with his fingers as well as he could though the result was not quite so satisfactory as it might have been
a question now came up for consideration
for the first time in his life dick possessed two suits of clothes
should he put on the clothes frank had given him or resume his old rags
now twentyfour hours before at the time dick was introduced to the readers notice no one could have been less fastidious as to his clothing than he
indeed he had rather a contempt for good clothes or at least he thought so
but now as he surveyed the ragged and dirty coat and the patched pants dick felt ashamed of them
he was unwilling to appear in the streets with them
yet if he went to work in his new suit he was in danger of spoiling it and he might not have it in his power to purchase a new one
economy dictated a return to the old garments
dick tried them on and surveyed himself in the cracked glass but the reflection did not please him
they dont look spectable he decided and forthwith taking them off again he put on the new suit of the day before
i must try to earn a little more he thought to pay for my room and to buy some new cloes when these is wore out he opened the door of his chamber and went downstairs and into the street carrying his blackingbox with him
it was dicks custom to commence his business before breakfast generally it must be owned because he began the day penniless and must earn his meal before he ate it
today it was different
he had four dollars left in his pocketbook but this he had previously determined not to touch
in fact he had formed the ambitious design of starting an account at a savings bank in order to have something to fall back upon in case of sickness or any other emergency or at any rate as a reserve fund to expend in clothing or other necessary articles when he required them
hitherto he had been content to live on from day to day without a penny ahead but the new vision of respectability which now floated before dicks mind owing to his recent acquaintance with frank was beginning to exercise a powerful effect upon him
in dicks profession as in others there are lucky days when everything seems to flow prosperously
as if to encourage him in his newborn resolution our hero obtained no less than six jobs in the course of an hour and a half
this gave him sixty cents quite abundant to purchase his breakfast and a comb besides
his exertions made him hungry and entering a small eatinghouse he ordered a cup of coffee and a beefsteak
to this he added a couple of rolls
this was quite a luxurious breakfast for dick and more expensive than he was accustomed to indulge himself with
to gratify the curiosity of my young readers i will put down the items with their cost coffee
cts
beefsteak
a couple of rolls
cts
it will thus be seen that our hero had expended nearly onehalf of his mornings earnings
some days he had been compelled to breakfast on five cents and then he was forced to content himself with a couple of apples or cakes
but a good breakfast is a good preparation for a busy day and dick sallied forth from the restaurant lively and alert ready to do a good stroke of business
dicks change of costume was liable to lead to one result of which he had not thought
his brother bootblacks might think he had grown aristocratic and was putting on airsthat in fact he was getting above his business and desirous to outshine his associates
dick had not dreamed of this because in fact in spite of his newborn ambition he entertained no such feeling
there was nothing of what boys call bigfeeling about him
he was a borough democrat using the word not politically but in its proper sense and was disposed to fraternize with all whom he styled good fellows without regard to their position
it may seem a little unnecessary to some of my readers to make this explanation but they must remember that pride and bigfeeling are confined to no age or class but may be found in boys as well as men and in bootblacks as well as those of a higher rank
the morning being a busy time with the bootblacks dicks changed appearance had not as yet attracted much attention
but when business slackened a little our hero was destined to be reminded of it
among the downtown bootblacks was one hailing from the five pointsa stout redhaired freckledfaced boy of fourteen bearing the name of micky maguire
this boy by his boldness and recklessness as well as by his personal strength which was considerable had acquired an ascendancy among his fellow professionals and had a gang of subservient followers whom he led on to acts of ruffianism not unfrequently terminating in a month or two at blackwells island
micky himself had served two terms there but the confinement appeared to have had very little effect in amending his conduct except perhaps in making him a little more cautious about an encounter with the copps as the members of the city police are for some unknown reason styled among the fivepoint boys
now micky was proud of his strength and of the position of leader which it had secured him
moreover he was democratic in his tastes and had a jealous hatred of those who wore good clothes and kept their faces clean
he called it putting on airs and resented the implied superiority
if he had been fifteen years older and had a trifle more education he would have interested himself in politics and been prominent at ward meetings and a terror to respectable voters on election day
as it was he contented himself with being the leader of a gang of young ruffians over whom he wielded a despotic power
now it is only justice to dick to say that so far as wearing good clothes was concerned he had never hitherto offended the eyes of micky maguire
indeed they generally looked as if they patronized the same clothing establishment
on this particular morning it chanced that micky had not been very fortunate in a business way and as a natural consequence his temper never very amiable was somewhat ruffled by the fact
he had had a very frugal breakfastnot because he felt abstemious but owing to the low state of his finances
he was walking along with one of his particular friends a boy nicknamed limpy jim so called from a slight peculiarity in his walk when all at once he espied our friend dick in his new suit
my eyes he exclaimed in astonishment jim just look at ragged dick
hes come into a fortun and turned gentleman
see his new clothes so he has said jim
whered he get em i wonder hooked em praps
lets go and stir him up a little
we dont want no gentlemen on our beat
so hes puttin on airsis he
ill give him a lesson so saying the two boys walked up to our hero who had not observed them his back being turned and micky maguire gave him a smart slap on the shoulder
dick turned round quickly
a battle and a victory whats that for demanded dick turning round to see who had struck him
youre gettin mighty fine said micky maguire surveying dicks new clothes with a scornful air
there was something in his words and tone which dick who was disposed to stand up for his dignity did not at all relish
well whats the odds if i am he retorted
does it hurt you any see him put on airs jim said micky turning to his companion
whered you get them cloes never mind where i got em
maybe the prince of wales gave em to me hear him now jim said micky
most likely he stole em stealin aint in my line it might have been unconscious the emphasis which dick placed on the word my at any rate micky chose to take offence
do you mean to say i steal he demanded doubling up his fist and advancing towards dick in a threatening manner
i dont say anything about it answered dick by no means alarmed at this hostile demonstration
i know youve been to the island twice
praps twas to make a visit along of the mayor and aldermen
maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression
i aint a goin to say mickys freckled face grew red with wrath for dick had only stated the truth
do you mean to insult me he demanded shaking the fist already doubled up in dicks face
maybe you want a lickin i aint particlarly anxious to get one said dick coolly
they dont agree with my constitution which is natrally delicate
id rather have a good dinner than a lickin any time youre afraid sneered micky
isnt he jim in course he is praps i am said dick composedly but it dont trouble me much do you want to fight demanded micky encouraged by dicks quietness fancying he was afraid to encounter him
no i dont said dick
i aint fond of fightin
its a very poor amusement and very bad for the complexion specially for the eyes and nose which is apt to turn red white and blue micky misunderstood dick and judged from the tenor of his speech that he would be an easy victim
as he knew dick very seldom was concerned in any street fightnot from cowardice as he imagined but because he had too much good sense to do so
being quarrelsome like all bullies and supposing that he was more than a match for our hero being about two inches taller he could no longer resist an inclination to assault him and tried to plant a blow in dicks face which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back just in time
now though dick was far from quarrelsome he was ready to defend himself on all occasions and it was too much to expect that he would stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten
he dropped his blackingbox on the instant and returned mickys blow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back and would have fallen if he had not been propped up by his confederate limpy jim
go in micky shouted the latter who was rather a coward on his own account but liked to see others fight
polish him off thats a good feller micky was now boiling over with rage and fury and required no urging
he was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor dick
he threw himself upon him and strove to bear him to the ground but dick avoiding a close hug in which he might possibly have got the worst of it by an adroit movement tripped up his antagonist and stretched him on the side walk
hit him jim exclaimed micky furiously
limpy jim did not seem inclined to obey orders
there was a quiet strength and coolness about dick which alarmed him
he preferred that micky should incur all the risks of battle and accordingly set himself to raising his fallen comrade
come micky said dick quietly youd better give it up
i wouldnt have touched you if you hadnt hit me first
i dont want to fight
its low business youre afraid of hurtin your cloes said micky with a sneer
maybe i am said dick
i hope i havent hurt yours mickys answer to this was another attack as violent and impetuous as the first
but his fury was in the way
he struck wildly not measuring his blows and dick had no difficulty in turning aside so that his antagonists blow fell upon the empty air and his momentum was such that he nearly fell forward headlong
dick might readily have taken advantage of his unsteadiness and knocked him down but he was not vindictive and chose to act on the defensive except when he could not avoid it
recovering himself micky saw that dick was a more formidable antagonist than he had supposed and was meditating another assault better planned which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the ground
but there was an unlookedfor interference
look out for the copp said jim in a low voice
micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him and thought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities
he accordingly picked up his blackbox and hitching up his pants walked off attended by limpy jim
whats that chap been doing asked the policeman of dick
he was amoosin himself by pitchin into me replied dick
what for he didnt like it cause i patronized a different tailor from him well it seems to me you are dressed pretty smart for a bootblack said the policeman
i wish i wasnt a bootblack said dick
never mind my lad
its an honest business said the policeman who was a sensible man and a worthy citizen
its an honest business
stick to it till you get something better i mean to said dick
it aint easy to get out of it as the prisoner remarked when he was asked how he liked his residence i hope you dont speak from experience no said dick i dont mean to get into prison if i can help it do you see that gentleman over there asked the officer pointing to a welldressed man who was walking on the other side of the street
yes well he was once a newsboy and what is he now he keeps a bookstore and is quite prosperous dick looked at the gentleman with interest wondering if he should look as respectable when he was a grown man
it will be seen that dick was getting ambitious
hitherto he had thought very little of the future but was content to get along as he could dining as well as his means would allow and spending the evenings in the pit of the old bowery eating peanuts between the acts if he was prosperous and if unlucky supping on dry bread or an apple and sleeping in an old box or a wagon
now for the first time he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his life
in seven years he would be a man and since his meeting with frank he felt that he would like to be a respectable man
he could see and appreciate the difference between frank and such a boy as micky maguire and it was not strange that he preferred the society of the former
in the course of the next morning in pursuance of his new resolutions for the future he called at a savings bank and held out four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change
there was a high railing and a number of clerks busily writing at desks behind it
dick never having been in a bank before did not know where to go
he went by mistake to the desk where money was paid out
wheres your book asked the clerk
i havent got any have you any money deposited here no sir i want to leave some here then go to the next desk dick followed directions and presented himself before an elderly man with gray hair who looked at him over the rims of his spectacles
i want you to keep that for me said dick awkwardly emptying his money out on the desk
how much is there five dollars have you got an account here no sir of course you can write the of course was said on account of dicks neat dress
have i got to do any writing asked our hero a little embarrassed
we want you to sign your name in this book and the old gentleman shoved round a large folio volume containing the names of depositors
dick surveyed the book with some awe
i aint much on writin he said
very well write as well as you can the pen was put into dicks hand and after dipping it in the inkstand he succeeded after a hard effort accompanied by many contortions of the face in inscribing upon the book of the bank the name dick hunter
dickthat means richard i suppose said the bank officer who had some difficulty in making out the signature
no ragged dick is what folks call me you dont look very ragged no ive left my rags to home
they might get wore out if i used em too common well my lad ill make out a book in the name of dick hunter since you seem to prefer dick to richard
i hope you will save up your money and deposit more with us our hero took his bankbook and gazed on the entry five dollars with a new sense of importance
he had been accustomed to joke about erie shares but now for the first time he felt himself a capitalist on a small scale to be sure but still it was no small thing for dick to have five dollars which he could call his own
he firmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare from his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate
but dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more than money needed to win a respectable position in the world
he felt that he was very ignorant
of reading and writing he only knew the rudiments and that with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic was all he did know of books
dick knew he must study hard and he dreaded it
he looked upon learning as attended with greater difficulties than it really possesses
but dick had good pluck
he meant to learn nevertheless and resolved to buy a book with his first spare earnings
when dick went home at night he locked up his bankbook in one of the drawers of the bureau
it was wonderful how much more independent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of that drawer and with what an important air of joint ownership he regarded the bank building in which his small savings were deposited
dick secures a tutor the next morning dick was unusually successful having plenty to do and receiving for one job twentyfive centsthe gentleman refusing to take change
then flashed upon dicks mind the thought that he had not yet returned the change due to the gentleman whose boots he had blacked on the morning of his introduction to the reader
whatll he think of me said dick to himself
i hope he wont think im mean enough to keep the money now dick was scrupulously honest and though the temptation to be otherwise had often been strong he had always resisted it
he was not willing on any account to keep money which did not belong to him and he immediately started for fulton street the address which had been given him where he found mr greysons name on the door of an office on the first floor
the door being open dick walked in
is mr greyson in he asked of a clerk who sat on a high stool before a desk
not just now
hell be in soon
will you wait yes said dick
very well take a seat then dick sat down and took up the morning tribune but presently came to a word of four syllables which he pronounced to himself a sticker and laid it down
but he had not long to wait for five minutes later mr greyson entered
did you wish to speak to me my lad said he to dick whom in his new clothes he did not recognize
yes sir said dick
i owe you some money indeed said mr greyson pleasantly thats an agreeable surprise
i didnt know but you had come for some
so you are a debtor of mine and not a creditor i blieve thats right said dick drawing fifteen cents from his pocket and placing in mr greysons hand
fifteen cents repeated he in some surprise
how do you happen to be indebted to me in that amount you gave me a quarter for ashinin your boots yesterday mornin and couldnt wait for the change
i meant to have brought it before but i forgot all about it till this mornin it had quite slipped my mind also
but you dont look like the boy i employed
if i remember rightly he wasnt as well dressed as you no said dick
i was dressed for a party then but the cloes was too well ventilated to be comfortable in cold weather youre an honest boy said mr greyson
who taught you to be honest nobody said dick
but its mean to cheat and steal
ive always knowed that then youve got ahead of some of our business men
do you read the bible no said dick
ive heard its a good book but i dont know much about it you ought to go to some sunday school
would you be willing yes said dick promptly
i want to grow up spectable
but i dont know where to go then ill tell you
the church i attend is at the corner of fifth avenue and twentyfirst street ive seen it said dick
i have a class in the sunday school there
if youll come next sunday ill take you into my class and do what i can to help you thank you said dick but praps youll get tired of teaching me
im awful ignorant no my lad said mr greyson kindly
you evidently have some good principles to start with as you have shown by your scorn of dishonesty
i shall hope good things of you in the future well dick said our hero apostrophizing himself as he left the office youre gettin up in the world
youve got money invested and are goin to attend church by particlar invitation on fifth avenue
i shouldnt wonder much if you should find cards when you get home from the mayor requestin the honor of your company to dinner along with other distinguished guests dick felt in very good spirits
he seemed to be emerging from the world in which he had hitherto lived into a new atmosphere of respectability and the change seemed very pleasant to him
at six oclock dick went into a restaurant on chatham street and got a comfortable supper
he had been so successful during the day that after paying for this he still had ninety cents left
while he was despatching his supper another boy came in smaller and slighter than dick and sat down beside him
dick recognized him as a boy who three months before had entered the ranks of the bootblacks but who from a natural timidity had not been able to earn much
he was illfitted for the coarse companionship of the street boys and shrank from the rude jokes of his present associates
dick had never troubled him for our hero had a certain chivalrous feeling which would not allow him to bully or disturb a younger and weaker boy than himself
how are you fosdick said dick as the other seated himself
pretty well said fosdick
i suppose youre all right oh yes im right side up with care
ive been havin a bully supper
what are you goin to have some bread and butter why dont you get a cup o coffee why said fosdick reluctantly i havent got money enough tonight never mind said dick im in luck today ill stand treat thats kind in you said fosdick gratefully
oh never mind that said dick
accordingly he ordered a cup of coffee and a plate of beefsteak and was gratified to see that his young companion partook of both with evident relish
when the repast was over the boys went out into the street together dick pausing at the desk to settle for both suppers
where are you going to sleep tonight fosdick asked dick as they stood on the sidewalk
i dont know said fosdick a little sadly
in some doorway i expect
but im afraid the police will find me out and make me move on ill tell you what said dick you must go home with me
i guess my bed will hold two have you got a room asked the other in surprise
yes said dick rather proudly and with a little excusable exultation
ive got a room over in mott street there i can receive my friends
thatll be better than sleepin in a doorwaywont it yes indeed it will said fosdick
how lucky i was to come across you
it comes hard to me living as i do
when my father was alive i had every comfort thats moren i ever had said dick
but im goin to try to live comfortable now
is your father dead yes said fosdick sadly
he was a printer but he was drowned one dark night from a fulton ferryboat and as i had no relations in the city and no money i was obliged to go to work as quick as i could
but i dont get on very well didnt you have no brothers nor sisters asked dick
no said fosdick father and i used to live alone
he was always so much company to me that i feel very lonesome without him
theres a man out west somewhere that owes him two thousand dollars
he used to live in the city and father lent him all his money to help him go into business but he failed or pretended to and went off
if father hadnt lost that money he would have left me well off but no money would have made up his loss to me whats the mans name that went off with your fathers money his name is hiram bates praps youll get the money again sometime there isnt much chance of it said fosdick
id sell out my chances of that for five dollars maybe ill buy you out sometime said dick
now come round and see what sort of a room ive got
i used to go to the theatre evenings when i had money but now id rather go to bed early and have a good sleep i dont care much about theatres said fosdick
father didnt use to let me go very often
he said it wasnt good for boys i like to go to the old bowery sometimes
they have tiptop plays there
can you read and write well he asked as a sudden thought came to him
yes said fosdick
father always kept me at school when he was alive and i stood pretty well in my classes
i was expecting to enter at the free academy next year now the college of the city of new york
then ill tell you what said dick ill make a bargain with you
i cant read much moren a pig and my writin looks like hens tracks
i dont want to grow up knowin no moren a fouryearold boy
if youll teach me readin and writin evenins you shall sleep in my room every night
thatll be bettern doorsteps or old boxes where ive slept many a time are you in earnest said fosdick his face lighting up hopefully
in course i am said dick
its fashionable for young gentlemen to have private tootors to introduct em into the flowerbeds of literatoor and science and why shouldnt i foller the fashion
you shall be my perfessor only you must promise not to be very hard if my writin looks like a railfence on a bender ill try not to be too severe said fosdick laughing
i shall be thankful for such a chance to get a place to sleep
have you got anything to read out of no said dick
my extensive and wellselected library was lost overboard in a storm when i was sailin from the sandwich islands to the desert of sahara
but ill buy a paper
thatll do me a long time accordingly dick stopped at a paperstand and bought a copy of a weekly paper filled with the usual variety of reading matterstories sketches poems etc
they soon arrived at dicks lodginghouse
our hero procuring a lamp from the landlady led the way into his apartment which he entered with the proud air of a proprietor
well how do you like it fosdick he asked complacently
the time was when fosdick would have thought it untidy and not particularly attractive
but he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter and he was not disposed to be critical
it looks very comfortable dick he said
the bed aint very large said dick but i guess we can get along oh yes said fosdick cheerfully
i dont take up much room then thats all right
theres two chairs you see one for you and one for me
in case the mayor comes in to spend the evenin socially he can sit on the bed the boys seated themselves and five minutes later under the guidance of his young tutor dick had commenced his studies
the first lesson fortunately for dick his young tutor was well qualified to instruct him
henry fosdick though only twelve years old knew as much as many boys of fourteen
he had always been studious and ambitious to excel
his father being a printer employed in an office where books were printed often brought home new books in sheets which henry was always glad to read
mr fosdick had been besides a subscriber to the mechanics apprentices library which contains many thousands of wellselected and instructive books
thus henry had acquired an amount of general information unusual in a boy of his age
perhaps he had devoted too much time to study for he was not naturally robust
all this however fitted him admirably for the office to which dick had appointed himthat of his private instructor
the two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table and spread out the paper before them
the exercises generally commence with ringin the bell said dick but as i aint got none well have to do without and the teacher is generally provided with a rod said fosdick
isnt there a poker handy that i can use in case my scholar doesnt behave well taint lawful to use firearms said dick
now dick said fosdick before we begin i must find out how much you already know
can you read any not enough to hurt me said dick
all i know about readin you could put in a nutshell and thered be room left for a small family i suppose you know your letters yes said dick i know em all but not intimately
i guess i can call em all by name where did you learn them
did you ever go to school yes i went two days why did you stop it didnt agree with my constitution you dont look very delicate said fosdick
no said dick i aint troubled much that way but i found lickins didnt agree with me did you get punished awful said dick
what for for indulgin in a little harmless amoosement said dick
you see the boy that was sittin next to me fell asleep which i considered improper in schooltime so i thought id help the teacher a little by wakin him up
so i took a pin and stuck into him but i guess it went a little too far for he screeched awful
the teacher found out what it was that made him holler and whipped me with a ruler till i was black and blue
i thought twas about time to take a vacation so thats the last time i went to school you didnt learn to read in that time of course no said dick but i was a newsboy a little while so i learned a little just sos to find out what the news was
sometimes i didnt read straight and called the wrong news
one mornin i asked another boy what the paper said and he told me the king of africa was dead
i thought it was all right till folks began to laugh well dick if youll only study well you wont be liable to make such mistakes i hope so said dick
my friend horace greeley told me the other day that hed get me to take his place now and then when he was off makin speeches if my edication hadnt been neglected i must find a good piece for you to begin on said fosdick looking over the paper
find an easy one said dick with words of one story fosdick at length found a piece which he thought would answer
he discovered on trial that dick had not exaggerated his deficiencies
words of two syllables he seldom pronounced right and was much surprised when he was told how through was sounded
seems to me its throwin away letters to use all them he said
how would you spell it asked his young teacher
thru said dick
well said fosdick theres a good many other words that are spelt with more letters than they need to have
but its the fashion and we must follow it but if dick was ignorant he was quick and had an excellent capacity
moreover he had perseverance and was not easily discouraged
he had made up his mind he must know more and was not disposed to complain of the difficulty of his task
fosdick had occasion to laugh more than once at his ludicrous mistakes but dick laughed too and on the whole both were quite interested in the lesson
at the end of an hour and a half the boys stopped for the evening
youre learning fast dick said fosdick
at this rate you will soon learn to read well will i asked dick with an expression of satisfaction
im glad of that
i dont want to be ignorant
i didnt use to care but i do now
i want to grow up spectable so do i dick
we will both help each other and i am sure we can accomplish something
but i am beginning to feel sleepy so am i said dick
them hard words make my head ache
i wonder who made em all thats more than i can tell
i suppose youve seen a dictionary thats another of em
no i cant say i have though i may have seen him in the street without knowin him a dictionary is a book containing all the words in the language how many are there i dont rightly know but i think there are about fifty thousand its a pretty large family said dick
have i got to learn em all that will not be necessary
there are a large number which you would never find occasion to use im glad of that said dick for i dont expect to live to be moren a hundred and by that time i wouldnt be moren half through by this time the flickering lamp gave a decided hint to the boys that unless they made haste they would have to undress in the dark
they accordingly drew off their clothes and dick jumped into bed
but fosdick before doing so knelt down by the side of the bed and said a short prayer
whats that for asked dick curiously
i was saying my prayers said fosdick as he rose from his knees
dont you ever do it no said dick
nobody ever taught me then ill teach you
shall i i dont know said dick dubiously
whats the good fosdick explained as well as he could and perhaps his simple explanation was better adapted to dicks comprehension than one from an older person would have been
dick felt more free to ask questions and the example of his new friend for whom he was beginning to feel a warm attachment had considerable effect upon him
when therefore fosdick asked again if he should teach him a prayer dick consented and his young bedfellow did so
dick was not naturally irreligious
if he had lived without a knowledge of god and of religious things it was scarcely to be wondered at in a lad who from an early age had been thrown upon his own exertions for the means of living with no one to care for him or give him good advice
but he was so far good that he could appreciate goodness in others and this it was that had drawn him to frank in the first place and now to henry fosdick
he did not therefore attempt to ridicule his companion as some boys better brought up might have done but was willing to follow his example in what something told him was right
our young hero had taken an important step toward securing that genuine respectability which he was ambitious to attain
weary with the days work and dick perhaps still more fatigued by the unusual mental effort he had made the boys soon sank into a deep and peaceful slumber from which they did not awaken till six oclock the next morning
before going out dick sought mrs mooney and spoke to her on the subject of taking fosdick as a roommate
he found that she had no objection provided he would allow her twentyfive cents a week extra in consideration of the extra trouble which his companion might be expected to make
to this dick assented and the arrangement was definitely concluded
this over the two boys went out and took stations near each other
dick had more of a business turn than henry and less shrinking from publicity so that his earnings were greater
but he had undertaken to pay the entire expenses of the room and needed to earn more
sometimes when two customers presented themselves at the same time he was able to direct one to his friend
so at the end of the week both boys found themselves with surplus earnings
dick had the satisfaction of adding two dollars and a half to his deposits in the savings bank and fosdick commenced an account by depositing seventyfive cents
on sunday morning dick bethought himself of his promise to mr greyson to come to the church on fifth avenue
to tell the truth dick recalled it with some regret
he had never been inside a church since he could remember and he was not much attracted by the invitation he had received
but henry finding him wavering urged him to go and offered to go with him
dick gladly accepted the offer feeling that he required someone to lend him countenance under such unusual circumstances
dick dressed himself with scrupulous care giving his shoes a shine so brilliant that it did him great credit in a professional point of view and endeavored to clean his hands thoroughly but in spite of all he could do they were not so white as if his business had been of a different character
having fully completed his preparations he descended into the street and with henry by his side crossed over to broadway
the boys pursued their way up broadway which on sunday presents a striking contrast in its quietness to the noise and confusion of ordinary weekdays as far as union square then turned down fourteenth street which brought them to fifth avenue
suppose we dine at delmonicos said fosdick looking towards that famous restaurant
id have to sell some of my erie shares said dick
a short walk now brought them to the church of which mention has already been made
they stood outside a little abashed watching the fashionably attired people who were entering and were feeling a little undecided as to whether they had better enter also when dick felt a light touch upon his shoulder
turning round he met the smiling glance of mr greyson
so my young friend you have kept your promise he said
and whom have you brought with you a friend of mine said dick
his name is henry fosdick i am glad you have brought him
now follow me and i will give you seats dicks first appearance in society it was the hour for morning service
the boys followed mr greyson into the handsome church and were assigned seats in his own pew
there were two persons already seated in ita goodlooking lady of middle age and a pretty little girl of nine
they were mrs greyson and her only daughter ida
they looked pleasantly at the boys as they entered smiling a welcome to them
the morning service commenced
it must be acknowledged that dick felt rather awkward
it was an unusual place for him and it need not be wondered at that he felt like a cat in a strange garret
he would not have known when to rise if he had not taken notice of what the rest of the audience did and followed their example
he was sitting next to ida and as it was the first time he had ever been near so welldressed a young lady he naturally felt bashful
when the hymns were announced ida found the place and offered a hymnbook to our hero
dick took it awkwardly but his studies had not yet been pursued far enough for him to read the words readily
however he resolved to keep up appearances and kept his eyes fixed steadily on the hymnbook
at length the service was over
the people began to file slowly out of church and among them of course mr greysons family and the two boys
it seemed very strange to dick to find himself in such different companionship from what he had been accustomed and he could not help thinking wonder what johnny nolan ould say if he could see me now but johnnys business engagements did not often summon him to fifth avenue and dick was not likely to be seen by any of his friends in the lower part of the city
we have our sunday school in the afternoon said mr greyson
i suppose you live at some distance from here in mott street sir answered dick
that is too far to go and return
suppose you and your friend come and dine with us and then we can come here together in the afternoon dick was as much astonished at this invitation as if he had really been invited by the mayor to dine with him and the board of aldermen
mr greyson was evidently a rich man and yet he had actually invited two bootblacks to dine with him
i guess wed better go home sir said dick hesitating
i dont think you can have any very pressing engagements to interfere with your accepting my invitation said mr greyson goodhumoredly for he understood the reason of dicks hesitation
so i take it for granted that you both accept before dick fairly knew what he intended to do he was walking down fifth avenue with his new friends
now our young hero was not naturally bashful but he certainly felt so now especially as miss ida greyson chose to walk by his side leaving henry fosdick to walk with her father and mother
what is your name asked ida pleasantly
our hero was about to answer ragged dick when it occurred to him that in the present company he had better forget his old nickname
dick hunter he answered
dick repeated ida
that means richard doesnt it everybody calls me dick i have a cousin dick said the young lady sociably
his name is dick wilson
i suppose you dont know him no said dick
i like the name of dick said the young lady with charming frankness
without being able to tell why dick felt rather glad she did
he plucked up courage to ask her name
my name is ida answered the young lady
do you like it yes said dick
its a bully name dick turned red as soon as he had said it for he felt that he had not used the right expression
the little girl broke into a silvery laugh
what a funny boy you are she said
i didnt mean it said dick stammering
i meant its a tiptop name here ida laughed again and dick wished himself back in mott street
how old are you inquired ida continuing her examination
im fourteengoin on fifteen said dick
youre a big boy of your age said ida
my cousin dick is a year older than you but he isnt as large dick looked pleased
boys generally like to be told that they are large of their age
how old be you asked dick beginning to feel more at his ease
im nine years old said ida
i go to miss jarviss school
ive just begun to learn french
do you know french not enough to hurt me said dick
ida laughed again and told him that he was a droll boy
do you like it asked dick
i like it pretty well except the verbs
i cant remember them well
do you go to school im studying with a private tutor said dick
are you
so is my cousin dick
hes going to college this year
are you going to college not this year because if you did you know youd be in the same class with my cousin
it would be funny to have two dicks in one class they turned down twentyfourth street passing the fifth avenue hotel on the left and stopped before an elegant house with a brown stone front
the bell was rung and the door being opened the boys somewhat abashed followed mr greyson into a handsome hall
they were told where to hang their hats and a moment afterwards were ushered into a comfortable diningroom where a table was spread for dinner
dick took his seat on the edge of a sofa and was tempted to rub his eyes to make sure that he was really awake
he could hardly believe that he was a guest in so fine a mansion
ida helped to put the boys at their ease
do you like pictures she asked
very much answered henry
the little girl brought a book of handsome engravings and seating herself beside dick to whom she seemed to have taken a decided fancy commenced showing them to him
there are the pyramids of egypt she said pointing to one engraving
what are they for asked dick puzzled
i dont see any winders no said ida i dont believe anybody lives there
do they papa no my dear
they were used for the burial of the dead
the largest of them is said to be the loftiest building in the world with one exception
the spire of the cathedral of strasburg is twentyfour feet higher if i remember rightly is egypt near here asked dick
oh no its ever so many miles off about four or five hundred
didnt you know no said dick
i never heard you dont appear to be very accurate in your information ida said her mother
four or five thousand miles would be considerably nearer the truth after a little more conversation they sat down to dinner
dick seated himself in an embarrassed way
he was very much afraid of doing or saying something which would be considered an impropriety and had the uncomfortable feeling that everybody was looking at him and watching his behavior
where do you live dick asked ida familiarly
in mott street where is that more than a mile off is it a nice street not very said dick
only poor folks live there are you poor little girls should be seen and not heard said her mother gently
if you are said ida ill give you the fivedollar goldpiece aunt gave me for a birthday present dick cannot be called poor my child said mrs greyson since he earns his living by his own exertions do you earn your living asked ida who was a very inquisitive young lady and not easily silenced
what do you do dick blushed violently
at such a table and in presence of the servant who was standing at that moment behind his chair he did not like to say that he was a shoeblack although he well knew that there was nothing dishonorable in the occupation
mr greyson perceived his feelings and to spare them said you are too inquisitive ida
sometime dick may tell you but you know we dont talk of business on sundays dick in his embarrassment had swallowed a large spoonful of hot soup which made him turn red in the face
for the second time in spite of the prospect of the best dinner he had ever eaten he wished himself back in mott street
henry fosdick was more easy and unembarrassed than dick not having led such a vagabond and neglected life
but it was to dick that ida chiefly directed her conversation having apparently taken a fancy to his frank and handsome face
i believe i have already said that dick was a very goodlooking boy especially now since he kept his face clean
he had a frank honest expression which generally won its way to the favor of those with whom he came in contact
dick got along pretty well at the table by dint of noticing how the rest acted but there was one thing he could not manage eating with his fork which by the way he thought a very singular arrangement
at length they arose from the table somewhat to dicks relief
again ida devoted herself to the boys and exhibited a profusely illustrated bible for their entertainment
dick was interested in looking at the pictures though he knew very little of their subjects
henry fosdick was much better informed as might have been expected
when the boys were about to leave the house with mr greyson for the sunday school ida placed her hand in dicks and said persuasively youll come again dick wont you thank you said dick id like to and he could not help thinking ida the nicest girl he had ever seen
yes said mrs greyson hospitably we shall be glad to see you both here again thank you very much said henry fosdick gratefully
we shall like very much to come i will not dwell upon the hour spent in sunday school nor upon the remarks of mr greyson to his class
he found dicks ignorance of religious subjects so great that he was obliged to begin at the beginning with him
dick was interested in hearing the children sing and readily promised to come again the next sunday
when the service was over dick and henry walked homewards
dick could not help letting his thoughts rest on the sweet little girl who had given him so cordial a welcome and hoping that he might meet her again
mr
greyson is a nice manisnt he dick asked henry as they were turning into mott street and were already in sight of their lodginghouse
aint he though said dick
he treated us just as if we were young gentlemen ida seemed to take a great fancy to you shes a tiptop girl said dick but she asked so many questions that i didnt know what to say he had scarcely finished speaking when a stone whizzed by his head and turning quickly he saw micky maguire running round the corner of the street which they had just passed
micky maguires second defeat dick was no coward
nor was he in the habit of submitting passively to an insult
when therefore he recognized micky as his assailant he instantly turned and gave chase
micky anticipated pursuit and ran at his utmost speed
it is doubtful if dick would have overtaken him but micky had the ill luck to trip just as he had entered a narrow alley and falling with some violence received a sharp blow from the hard stones which made him scream with pain
ow he whined
dont you hit a feller when hes down what made you fire that stone at me demanded our hero looking down at the fallen bully
just for fun said micky
it would have been a very agreeable sprise if it had hit me said dick
sposin i fire a rock at you jest for fun dont exclaimed micky in alarm
it seems you dont like agreeable sprises said dick any moren the man did what got hooked by a cow one mornin before breakfast
it didnt improve his appetite much ive most broke my arm said micky ruefully rubbing the affected limb
if its broke you cant fire no more stones which is a very cheerin reflection said dick
ef you havent money enough to buy a wooden one ill lend you a quarter
theres one good thing about wooden ones they aint liable to get cold in winter which is another cheerin reflection i dont want none of yer cheerin reflections said micky sullenly
yer company aint wanted here thank you for your polite invitation to leave said dick bowing ceremoniously
im willin to go but ef you throw any more stones at me micky maguire ill hurt you worse than the stones did the only answer made to this warning was a scowl from his fallen opponent
it was quite evident that dick had the best of it and he thought it prudent to say nothing
as ive got a friend waitin outside i shall have to tear myself away said dick
youd better not throw any more stones micky maguire for it dont seem to agree with your constitution micky muttered something which dick did not stay to hear
he backed out of the alley keeping a watchful eye on his fallen foe and rejoined henry fosdick who was awaiting his return
who was it dick he asked
a particlar friend of mine micky maguire said dick
he playfully fired a rock at my head as a mark of his fection
he loves me like a brother micky does rather a dangerous kind of a friend i should think said fosdick
he might have killed you ive warned him not to be so fectionate another time said dick
i know him said henry fosdick
hes at the head of a gang of boys living at the fivepoints
he threatened to whip me once because a gentleman employed me to black his boots instead of him hes been at the island two or three times for stealing said dick
i guess he wont touch me again
hed rather get hold of small boys
if he ever does anything to you fosdick just let me know and ill give him a thrashing dick was right
micky maguire was a bully and like most bullies did not fancy tackling boys whose strength was equal or superior to his own
although he hated dick more than ever because he thought our hero was putting on airs he had too lively a remembrance of his strength and courage to venture upon another open attack
he contented himself therefore whenever he met dick with scowling at him
dick took this very philosophically remarking that if it was soothin to mickys feelings he might go ahead as it didnt hurt him much it will not be necessary to chronicle the events of the next few weeks
a new life had commenced for dick
he no longer haunted the gallery of the old bowery and even tony pastors hospitable doors had lost their old attractions
he spent two hours every evening in study
his progress was astonishingly rapid
he was gifted with a natural quickness and he was stimulated by the desire to acquire a fair education as a means of growin up spectable as he termed it
much was due also to the patience and perseverance of henry fosdick who made a capital teacher
youre improving wonderfully dick said his friend one evening when dick had read an entire paragraph without a mistake
am i said dick with satisfaction
yes
if youll buy a writingbook tomorrow we can begin writing tomorrow evening what else do you know henry asked dick
arithmetic and geography and grammar what a lot you know said dick admiringly
i dont know any of them said fosdick
ive only studied them
i wish i knew a great deal more ill be satisfied when i know as much as you said dick
it seems a great deal to you now dick but in a few months youll think differently
the more you know the more youll want to know then there aint any end to learnin said dick
no well said dick i guess ill be as much as sixty before i know everything yes as old as that probably said fosdick laughing
anyway you know too much to be blackin boots
leave that to ignorant chaps like me you wont be ignorant long dick youd ought to get into some office or countinroom i wish i could said fosdick earnestly
i dont succeed very well at blacking boots
you make a great deal more than i do thats cause i aint troubled with bashfulness said dick
bashfulness aint as natural to me as it is to you
im always on hand as the cat said to the milk
youd better give up shines fosdick and give your tention to mercantile pursuits ive thought of trying to get a place said fosdick but no one would take me with these clothes and he directed his glance to his wellworn suit which he kept as neat as he could but which in spite of all his care began to show decided marks of use
there was also here and there a stain of blacking upon it which though an advertisement of his profession scarcely added to its good appearance
i almost wanted to stay at home from sunday school last sunday he continued because i thought everybody would notice how dirty and worn my clothes had got to be if my clothes wasnt two sizes too big for you said dick generously id change
youd look as if youd got into your greatuncles suit by mistake youre very kind dick to think of changing said fosdick for your suit is much better than mine but i dont think that mine would suit you very well
the pants would show a little more of your ankles than is the fashion and you couldnt eat a very hearty dinner without bursting the buttons off the vest that wouldnt be very convenient said dick
i aint fond of lacin to show my elegant figger
but i say he added with a sudden thought how much money have we got in the savings bank fosdick took a key from his pocket and went to the drawer in which the bankbooks were kept and opening it brought them out for inspection
it was found that dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety cents placed to his credit while fosdick had six dollars and fortyfive cents
to explain the large difference it must be remembered that dick had deposited five dollars before henry deposited anything being the amount he had received as a gift from mr whitney
how much does that make the lot of it asked dick
i aint much on figgers yet you know it makes twentyfive dollars and thirtyfive cents dick said his companion who did not understand the thought which suggested the question
take it and buy some clothes henry said dick shortly
what your money too in course no dick you are too generous
i couldnt think of it
almost threequarters of the money is yours
you must spend it on yourself i dont need it said dick
you may not need it now but you will some time i shall have some more then that may be but it wouldnt be fair for me to use your money dick
i thank you all the same for your kindness well ill lend it to you then persisted dick and you can pay me when you get to be a rich merchant but it isnt likely i ever shall be one how dyou know
i went to a fortun teller once and she told me i was born under a lucky star with a hard name and i should have a rich man for my particular friend who would make my fortun
i guess you are going to be the rich man fosdick laughed and steadily refused for some time to avail himself of dicks generous proposal but at length perceiving that our hero seemed much disappointed and would be really glad if his offer were accepted he agreed to use as much as might be needful
this at once brought back dicks goodhumor and he entered with great enthusiasm into his friends plans
the next day they withdrew the money from the bank and when business got a little slack in the afternoon set out in search of a clothing store
dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a place where a good bargain could be obtained
he was determined that fosdick should have a good serviceable suit even if it took all the money they had
the result of their search was that for twentythree dollars fosdick obtained a very neat outfit including a couple of shirts a hat and a pair of shoes besides a dark mixed suit which appeared stout and of good quality
shall i send the bundle home asked the salesman impressed by the offhand manner in which dick drew out the money in payment for the clothes
thank you said dick youre very kind but ill take it home myself and you can allow me something for my trouble all right said the clerk laughing ill allow it on your next purchase proceeding to their apartment in mott street fosdick at once tried on his new suit and it was found to be an excellent fit
dick surveyed his new friend with much satisfaction
you look like a young gentleman of fortun he said and do credit to your governor i suppose that means you dick said fosdick laughing
in course it does you should say of course said fosdick who in virtue of his position as dicks tutor ventured to correct his language from time to time
how dare you correct your govnor said dick with comic indignation
ill cut you off with a shillin you young dog as the markis says to his nephew in the play at the old bowery fosdick changes his business fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his business
this he felt would have been wasteful extravagance
about ten oclock in the morning when business slackened he went home and dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of the morning herald and sun and noting down the places where a boy was wanted went on a round of applications
but he found it no easy thing to obtain a place
swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place
there was another difficulty
it was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents
when fosdick on being questioned revealed the fact of his having no parents and being a boy of the street this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal
merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life
dick who was always ready for an emergency suggested borrowing a white wig and passing himself off for fosdicks father or grandfather
but henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain
after fifty applications and as many failures fosdick began to get discouraged
there seemed to be no way out of his present business for which he felt unfitted
i dont know but i shall have to black boots all my life he said one day despondently to dick
keep a stiff upper lip said dick
by the time you get to be a grayheaded veteran you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the bowery which is a very cheerin reflection so dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up fosdicks courage
as for me said dick i expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun out of shines and live in princely style on the avenoo but one morning fosdick straying into frenchs hotel discovered the following advertisement in the columns of the herald wanteda smart capable boy to run errands and make himself generally useful in a hat and cap store
salary three dollars a week at first
inquire at no
broadway after ten oclock am he determined to make application and as the city hall clock just then struck the hour indicated lost no time in proceeding to the store which was only a few blocks distant from the astor house
it was easy to find the store as from a dozen to twenty boys were already assembled in front of it
they surveyed each other askance feeling that they were rivals and mentally calculating each others chances
there isnt much chance for me said fosdick to dick who had accompanied him
look at all these boys
most of them have good homes i suppose and good recommendations while i have nobody to refer to go ahead said dick
your chance is as good as anybodys while this was passing between dick and his companion one of the boys a rather superciliouslooking young gentleman genteelly dressed and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and himself turned suddenly to dick and remarked ive seen you before oh have you said dick whirling round then praps youd like to see me behind at this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the exception of the questioner who evidently considered that dick had been disrespectful
ive seen you somewhere he said in a surly tone correcting himself
most likely you have said dick
thats where i generally keep myself there was another laugh at the expense of roswell crawford for that was the name of the young aristocrat
but he had his revenge ready
no boy relishes being an object of ridicule and it was with a feeling of satisfaction that he retorted i know you for all your impudence
youre nothing but a bootblack this information took the boys who were standing around by surprise for dick was welldressed and had none of the implements of his profession with him
spose i be said dick
have you got any objection not at all said roswell curling his lip only youd better stick to blacking boots and not try to get into a store thank you for your kind advice said dick
is it gratooitous or do you expect to be paid for it youre an impudent fellow thats a very cheerin reflection said dick goodnaturedly
do you expect to get this place when theres gentlemens sons applying for it
a bootblack in a store
that would be a good joke boys as well as men are selfish and looking upon dick as a possible rival the boys who listened seemed disposed to take the same view of the situation
thats what i say said one of them taking sides with roswell
dont trouble yourselves said dick
i aint agoin to cut you out
i cant afford to give up a independent and loocrative purfession for a salary of three dollars a week hear him talk said roswell crawford with an unpleasant sneer
if you are not trying to get the place what are you here for i came with a friend of mine said dick indicating fosdick whos goin in for the situation is he a bootblack too demanded roswell superciliously
he retorted dick loftily
didnt you know his father was a member of congress and intimately acquainted with all the biggest men in the state the boys surveyed fosdick as if they did not quite know whether to credit this statement which for the credit of dicks veracity it will be observed he did not assert but only propounded in the form of a question
there was no time for comment however as just then the proprietor of the store came to the door and casting his eyes over the waiting group singled out roswell crawford and asked him to enter
well my lad how old are you fourteen years old said roswell consequentially
are your parents living only my mother
my father is dead
he was a gentleman he added complacently
oh was he said the shopkeeper
do you live in the city yes sir
in clinton place have you ever been in a situation before yes sir said roswell a little reluctantly
where was it in an office on dey street how long were you there a week it seems to me that was a short time
why did you not stay longer because said roswell loftily the man wanted me to get to the office at eight oclock and make the fire
im a gentlemans son and am not used to such dirty work indeed said the shopkeeper
well young gentleman you may step aside a few minutes
i will speak with some of the other boys before making my selection several other boys were called in and questioned
roswell stood by and listened with an air of complacency
he could not help thinking his chances the best
the man can see im a gentleman and will do credit to his store he thought
at length it came to fosdicks turn
he entered with no very sanguine anticipations of success
unlike roswell he set a very low estimate upon his qualifications when compared with those of other applicants
but his modest bearing and quiet gentlemanly manner entirely free from pretension prepossessed the shopkeeper who was a sensible man in his favor
do you reside in the city he asked
yes sir said henry
what is your age twelve have you ever been in any situation no sir i should like to see a specimen of your handwriting
here take the pen and write your name henry fosdick had a very handsome handwriting for a boy of his age while roswell who had submitted to the same test could do little more than scrawl
do you reside with your parents no sir they are dead where do you live then in mott street roswell curled his lip when this name was pronounced for mott street as my new york readers know is in the immediate neighborhood of the fivepoints and very far from a fashionable locality
have you any testimonials to present asked mr henderson for that was his name
fosdick hesitated
this was the question which he had foreseen would give him trouble
but at this moment it happened most opportunely that mr greyson entered the shop with the intention of buying a hat
yes said fosdick promptly i will refer to this gentleman how do you do fosdick asked mr greyson noticing him for the first time
how do you happen to be here i am applying for a place sir said fosdick
may i refer the gentleman to you certainly i shall be glad to speak a good word for you
mr henderson this is a member of my sundayschool class of whose good qualities and good abilities i can speak confidently that will be sufficient said the shopkeeper who knew mr greysons high character and position
he could have no better recommendation
you may come to the store tomorrow morning at half past seven oclock
the pay will be three dollars a week for the first six months
if i am satisfied with you i shall then raise it to five dollars the other boys looked disappointed but none more so than roswell crawford
he would have cared less if any one else had obtained the situation but for a boy who lived in mott street to be preferred to him a gentlemans son he considered indeed humiliating
in a spirit of petty spite he was tempted to say hes a bootblack
ask him if he isnt hes an honest and intelligent lad said mr greyson
as for you young man i only hope you have onehalf his good qualities roswell crawford left the store in disgust and the other unsuccessful applicants with him
what luck fosdick asked dick eagerly as his friend came out of the store
ive got the place said fosdick in accents of satisfaction but it was only because mr greyson spoke up for me hes a trump said dick enthusiastically
the gentleman so denominated came out before the boys went away and spoke with them kindly
both dick and henry were highly pleased at the success of the application
the pay would indeed be small but expended economically fosdick thought he could get along on it receiving his room rent as before in return for his services as dicks private tutor
dick determined as soon as his education would permit to follow his companions example
i dont know as youll be willin to room with a bootblack he said to henry now youre goin into business i couldnt room with a better friend dick said fosdick affectionately throwing his arm round our hero
when we part itll be because you wish it so fosdick entered upon a new career
nine months later the next morning fosdick rose early put on his new suit and after getting breakfast set out for the broadway store in which he had obtained a position
he left his little blackingbox in the room
itll do to brush my own shoes he said
who knows but i may have to come back to it again no danger said dick ill take care of the feet and youll have to look after the heads now youre in a hatstore i wish you had a place too said fosdick
i dont know enough yet said dick
wait till ive gradooated and can put ab
after your name whats that it stands for bachelor of arts
its a degree that students get when they graduate from college oh said dick i didnt know but it meant a bootblack
i can put that after my name now
wouldnt dick hunter ab sound tiptop i must be going said fosdick
it wont do for me to be late the very first morning thats the difference between you and me said dick
im my own boss and there aint no one to find fault with me if im late
but i might as well be goin too
theres a gent as comes down to his store pretty early that generally wants a shine the two boys parted at the park
fosdick crossed it and proceeded to the hatstore while dick hitching up his pants began to look about him for a customer
it was seldom that dick had to wait long
he was always on the alert and if there was any business to do he was always sure to get his share of it
he had now a stronger inducement than ever to attend strictly to business his little stock of money in the savings bank having been nearly exhausted by his liberality to his roommate
he determined to be as economical as possible and moreover to study as hard as he could that he might be able to follow fosdicks example and obtain a place in a store or countingroom
as there were no striking incidents occurring in our heros history within the next nine months i propose to pass over that period and recount the progress he made in that time
fosdick was still at the hatstore having succeeded in giving perfect satisfaction to mr henderson
his wages had just been raised to five dollars a week
he and dick still kept house together at mrs mooneys lodginghouse and lived very frugally so that both were able to save up money
dick had been unusually successful in business
he had several regular patrons who had been drawn to him by his ready wit and quick humor and from two of them he had received presents of clothing which had saved him any expense on that score
his income had averaged quite seven dollars a week in addition to this
of this amount he was now obliged to pay one dollar weekly for the room which he and fosdick occupied but he was still able to save one half the remainder
at the end of nine months therefore or thirtynine weeks it will be seen that he had accumulated no less a sum than one hundred and seventeen dollars
dick may be excused for feeling like a capitalist when he looked at the long row of deposits in his little bankbook
there were other boys in the same business who had earned as much money but they had had little care for the future and spent as they went along so that few could boast a bankaccount however small
youll be a rich man some time dick said henry fosdick one evening
and live on fifth avenoo said dick
perhaps so
stranger things have happened well said dick if such a misfortin should come upon me i should bear it like a man
when you see a fifth avenoo manshun for sale for a hundred and seventeen dollars just let me know and ill buy it as an investment two hundred and fifty years ago you might have bought one for that price probably
real estate wasnt very high among the indians just my luck said dick i was born too late
id orter have been an indian and lived in splendor on my present capital im afraid youd have found your present business rather unprofitable at that time but dick had gained something more valuable than money
he had studied regularly every evening and his improvement had been marvellous
he could now read well write a fair hand and had studied arithmetic as far as interest
besides this he had obtained some knowledge of grammar and geography
if some of my boy readers who have been studying for years and got no farther than this should think it incredible that dick in less than a year and studying evenings only should have accomplished it they must remember that our hero was very much in earnest in his desire to improve
he knew that in order to grow up respectable he must be well advanced and he was willing to work
but then the reader must not forget that dick was naturally a smart boy
his street education had sharpened his faculties and taught him to rely upon himself
he knew that it would take him a long time to reach the goal which he had set before him and he had patience to keep on trying
he knew that he had only himself to depend upon and he determined to make the most of himselfa resolution which is the secret of success in nine cases out of ten
dick said fosdick one evening after they had completed their studies i think youll have to get another teacher soon why asked dick in some surprise
have you been offered a more loocrative position no said fosdick but i find i have taught you all i know myself
you are now as good a scholar as i am is that true said dick eagerly a flush of gratification coloring his brown cheek
yes said fosdick
youve made wonderful progress
i propose now that evening schools have begun that we join one and study together through the winter all right said dick
id be willin to go now but when i first began to study i was ashamed to have anybody know that i was so ignorant
do you really mean fosdick that i know as much as you yes dick its true then ive got you to thank for it said dick earnestly
youve made me what i am and havent you paid me dick by payin the roomrent said dick impulsively
whats that
it isnt half enough
i wish youd take half my money you deserve it thank you dick but youre too generous
youve more than paid me
who was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me
and who gave me money to buy clothes and so got me my situation oh thats nothing said dick
its a great deal dick
i shall never forget it
but now it seems to me you might try to get a situation yourself do i know enough you know as much as i do then ill try said dick decidedly
i wish there was a place in our store said fosdick
it would be pleasant for us to be together never mind said dick therell be plenty of other chances
praps a t stewart might like a partner
i wouldnt ask moren a quarter of the profits which would be a very liberal proposal on your part said fosdick smiling
but perhaps mr stewart might object to a partner living on mott street id just as lieves move to fifth avenoo said dick
i aint got no prejudices in favor of mott street nor i said fosdick and in fact i have been thinking it might be a good plan for us to move as soon as we could afford
mrs mooney doesnt keep the room quite so neat as she might no said dick
she aint got no prejudices against dirt
look at that towel dick held up the article indicated which had now seen service nearly a week and hard service at thatdicks avocation causing him to be rather hard on towels
yes said fosdick ive got about tired of it
i guess we can find some better place without having to pay much more
when we move you must let me pay my share of the rent well see about that said dick
do you propose to move to fifth avenoo not just at present but to some more agreeable neighborhood than this
well wait till you get a situation and then we can decide a few days later as dick was looking about for customers in the neighborhood of the park his attention was drawn to a fellow bootblack a boy about a year younger than himself who appeared to have been crying
whats the matter tom asked dick
havent you had luck today pretty good said the boy but were havin hard times at home
mother fell last week and broke her arm and tomorrow weve got to pay the rent and if we dont the landlord says hell turn us out havent you got anything except what you earn asked dick
no said tom not now
mother used to earn three or four dollars a week but she cant do nothin now and my little sister and brother are too young dick had quick sympathies
he had been so poor himself and obliged to submit to so many privations that he knew from personal experience how hard it was
tom wilkins he knew as an excellent boy who never squandered his money but faithfully carried it home to his mother
in the days of his own extravagance and shiftlessness he had once or twice asked tom to accompany him to the old bowery or tony pastors but tom had always steadily refused
im sorry for you tom he said
how much do you owe for rent two weeks now said tom
how much is it a week two dollars a weekthat makes four have you got anything towards it no ive had to spend all my money for food for mother and the rest of us
ive had pretty hard work to do that
i dont know what well do
i havent any place to go to and im afraid motherll get cold in her arm cant you borrow the money somewhere asked dick
tom shook his head despondingly
all the people i know are as poor as i am said he
theyd help me if they could but its hard work for them to get along themselves ill tell you what tom said dick impulsively ill stand your friend have you got any money asked tom doubtfully
got any money repeated dick
dont you know that i run a bank on my own account
how much is it you need four dollars said tom
if we dont pay that before tomorrow night out we go
you havent got as much as that have you here are three dollars said dick drawing out his pocketbook
ill let you have the rest tomorrow and maybe a little more youre a right down good fellow dick said tom but wont you want it yourself oh ive got some more said dick
maybe ill never be able to pay you spose you dont said dick i guess i wont fail i wont forget it dick
i hope ill be able to do somethin for you sometime all right said dick
id ought to help you
i havent got no mother to look out for
i wish i had there was a tinge of sadness in his tone as he pronounced the last four words but dicks temperament was sanguine and he never gave way to unavailing sadness
accordingly he began to whistle as he turned away only adding ill see you tomorrow tom the three dollars which dick had handed to tom wilkins were his savings for the present week
it was now thursday afternoon
his rent which amounted to a dollar he expected to save out of the earnings of friday and saturday
in order to give tom the additional assistance he had promised dick would be obliged to have recourse to his banksavings
he would not have ventured to trench upon it for any other reason but this
but he felt that it would be selfish to allow tom and his mother to suffer when he had it in his power to relieve them
but dick was destined to be surprised and that in a disagreeable manner when he reached home
dick loses his bankbook it was hinted at the close of the last chapter that dick was destined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home
having agreed to give further assistance to tom wilkins he was naturally led to go to the drawer where he and fosdick kept their bankbooks
to his surprise and uneasiness the drawer proved to be empty come here a minute fosdick he said
whats the matter dick i cant find my bankbook nor yours either
whats come of them i took mine with me this morning thinking i might want to put in a little more money
ive got it in my pocket now but wheres mine asked dick perplexed
i dont know
i saw it in the drawer when i took mine this morning are you sure yes positive for i looked into it to see how much you had got did you lock it again asked dick
yes didnt you have to unlock it just now so i did said dick
but its gone now
somebody opened it with a key that fitted the lock and then locked it agin that must have been the way its rather hard on a feller said dick who for the first time since we became acquainted with him began to feel downhearted
dont give it up dick
you havent lost the money only the bankbook aint that the same thing no
you can go to the bank tomorrow morning as soon as it opens and tell them you have lost the book and ask them not to pay the money to any one except yourself so i can said dick brightening up
that is if the thief hasnt been to the bank today if he has they might detect him by his handwriting id like to get hold of the one that stole it said dick indignantly
id give him a good lickin it must have been somebody in the house
suppose we go and see mrs mooney
she may know whether anybody came into our room today the two boys went downstairs and knocked at the door of a little back sittingroom where mrs mooney generally spent her evenings
it was a shabby little room with a threadbare carpet on the floor the walls covered with a certain largefigured paper patches of which had been stripped off here and there exposing the plaster the remainder being defaced by dirt and grease
but mrs mooney had one of those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt and didnt mind it in the least
she was seated beside a small pine worktable industriously engaged in mending stockings
goodevening mrs mooney said fosdick politely
goodevening said the landlady
sit down if you can find chairs
im hard at work as you see but a poor lone widder cant afford to be idle we cant stop long mrs mooney but my friend here has had something taken from his room today and we thought wed come and see you about it what is it asked the landlady
you dont think id take anything
if i am poor its an honest name ive always had as all my lodgers can testify certainly not mrs mooney but there are others in the house that may not be honest
my friend has lost his bankbook
it was safe in the drawer this morning but tonight it is not to be found how much money was there in it asked mrs mooney
over a hundred dollars said fosdick
it was my whole fortun said dick
i was goin to buy a house next year mrs mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of dicks wealth and was disposed to regard him with increased respect
was the drawer locked she asked
yes then it couldnt have been bridget
i dont think she has any keys she wouldnt know what a bankbook was said fosdick
you didnt see any of the lodgers go into our room today did you i shouldnt wonder if it was jim travis said mrs mooney suddenly
this james travis was a bartender in a low groggery in mulberry street and had been for a few weeks an inmate of mrs mooneys lodginghouse
he was a coarselooking fellow who from his appearance evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out to others
he occupied a room opposite dicks and was often heard by the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication uttering shocking oaths
this travis had made several friendly overtures to dick and his roommate and had invited them to call round at the barroom where he tended and take something
but this invitation had never been accepted partly because the boys were better engaged in the evening and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to mr travis which certainly was not strange for nature had not gifted him with many charms either of personal appearance or manners
the rejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike to dick and henry whom he considered stiff and unsocial
what makes you think it was travis asked fosdick
he isnt at home in the daytime but he was today
he said he had got a bad cold and had to come home for a clean handkerchief did you see him asked dick
yes said mrs mooney
bridget was hanging out clothes and i went to the door to let him in i wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer said fosdick
yes said mrs mooney
the bureaus in the two rooms are just alike
i got em at auction and most likely the locks is the same it must have been he said dick looking towards fosdick
yes said fosdick it looks like it whats to be done
thats what id like to know said dick
of course hell say he hasnt got it and he wont be such a fool as to leave it in his room if he hasnt been to the bank its all right said fosdick
you can go there the first thing tomorrow morning and stop their paying any money on it but i cant get any money on it myself said dick
i told tom wilkins id let him have some more money tomorrow or his sick motherll have to turn out of their lodgins how much money were you going to give him i gave him three dollars today and was goin to give him two dollars tomorrow ive got the money dick
i didnt go to the bank this morning all right
ill take it and pay you back next week no dick if youve given three dollars you must let me give two no fosdick id rather give the whole
you know ive got more money than you
no i havent either said dick the memory of his loss flashing upon him
i thought i was rich this morning but now im in destitoot circumstances cheer up dick youll get your money back i hope so said our hero rather ruefully
the fact was that our friend dick was beginning to feel what is so often experienced by men who do business of a more important character and on a larger scale than he the bitterness of a reverse of circumstances
with one hundred dollars and over carefully laid away in the savings bank he had felt quite independent
wealth is comparative and dick probably felt as rich as many men who are worth a hundred thousand dollars
he was beginning to feel the advantages of his steady selfdenial and to experience the pleasures of property
not that dick was likely to be unduly attached to money
let it be said to his credit that it had never given him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help tom wilkins in his trouble
besides this there was another thought that troubled him
when he obtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was now making from blacking bootsprobably not more than three dollars a weekwhile his expenses without clothing would amount to four dollars
to make up the deficiency he had confidently relied upon his savings which would be sufficient to carry him along for a year if necessary
if he should not recover his money he would be compelled to continue a bootblack for at least six months longer and this was rather a discouraging reflection
on the whole it is not to be wondered at that dick felt unusually sober this evening and that neither of the boys felt much like studying
the two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to travis about it
it was not altogether easy to decide
fosdick was opposed to it
it will only put him on his guard said he and i dont see as it will do any good
of course he will deny it
wed better keep quiet and watch him and by giving notice at the bank we can make sure that he doesnt get any money on it
if he does present himself at the bank they will know at once that he is a thief and he can be arrested this view seemed reasonable and dick resolved to adopt it
on the whole he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at first supposed and his spirits rose a little
howd he know i had any bankbook
thats what i cant make out he said
dont you remember said fosdick after a moments thought we were speaking of our savings two or three evenings since yes said dick
our door was a little open at the time and i heard somebody come upstairs and stop a minute in front of it
it must have been jim travis
in that way he probably found out about your money and took the opportunity today to get hold of it this might or might not be the correct explanation
at all events it seemed probable
the boys were just on the point of going to bed later in the evening when a knock was heard at the door and to their no little surprise their neighbor jim travis proved to be the caller
he was a sallowcomplexioned young man with dark hair and bloodshot eyes
he darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered which did not escape the boys notice
how are ye tonight he said sinking into one of the two chairs with which the room was scantily furnished
jolly said dick
how are you tired as a dog was the reply
hard work and poor pay thats the way with me
i wanted to go to the theater tonight but i was hard up and couldnt raise the cash here he darted another quick glance at the boys but neither betrayed anything
you dont go out much do you he said not much said fosdick
we spend our evenings in study thats precious slow said travis rather contemptuously
whats the use of studying so much
you dont expect to be a lawyer do you or anything of that sort maybe said dick
i havent made up my mind yet
if my fellercitizens should want me to go to congress some time i shouldnt want to disappint em and then readin and writin might come handy well said travis rather abruptly im tired and i guess ill turn in goodnight said fosdick
the boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room
he came in to see if wed missed the bankbook said dick
and to turn off suspicion from himself by letting us know he had no money added fosdick
thats so said dick
id like to have searched them pockets of his tracking the thief fosdick was right in supposing that jim travis had stolen the bankbook
he was also right in supposing that that worthy young man had come to the knowledge of dicks savings by what he had accidentally overheard
now travis like a very large number of young men of his class was able to dispose of a larger amount of money than he was able to earn
moreover he had no great fancy for work at all and would have been glad to find some other way of obtaining money enough to pay his expenses
he had recently received a letter from an old companion who had strayed out to california and going at once to the mines had been lucky enough to get possession of a very remunerative claim
he wrote to travis that he had already realized two thousand dollars from it and expected to make his fortune within six months
two thousand dollars
this seemed to travis a very large sum and quite dazzled his imagination
he was at once inflamed with the desire to go out to california and try his luck
in his present situation he only received thirty dollars a month which was probably all that his services were worth but went a very little way towards gratifying his expensive tastes
accordingly he determined to take the next steamer to the land of gold if he could possibly manage to get money enough to pay the passage
the price of a steerage passage at that time was seventyfive dollarsnot a large sum certainlybut it might as well have been seventyfive hundred for any chance james travis had of raising the amount at present
his available funds consisted of precisely two dollars and a quarter of which sum one dollar and a half was due to his washerwoman
this however would not have troubled travis much and he would conveniently have forgotten all about it but even leaving this debt unpaid the sum at his command would not help him materially towards paying his passage money
travis applied for help to two or three of his companions but they were all of that kind who never keep an account with savings banks but carry all their spare cash about with them
one of these friends offered to lend him thirtyseven cents and another a dollar but neither of these offers seemed to encourage him much
he was about giving up his project in despair when he learned accidentally as we have already said the extent of dicks savings
one hundred and seventeen dollars
why that would not only pay his passage but carry him up to the mines after he had arrived in san francisco
he could not help thinking it over and the result of this thinking was that he determined to borrow it of dick without leave
knowing that neither of the boys were in their room in the daytime he came back in the course of the morning and being admitted by mrs mooney herself said by way of accounting for his presence that he had a cold and had come back for a handkerchief
the landlady suspected nothing and returning at once to her work in the kitchen left the coast clear
travis at once entered dicks room and as there seemed to be no other place for depositing money tried the bureaudrawers
they were all readily opened except one which proved to be locked
this he naturally concluded must contain the money and going back to his own chamber for the key of the bureau tried it on his return and found to his satisfaction that it would fit
when he discovered the bankbook his joy was mingled with disappointment
he had expected to find bankbills instead
this would have saved all further trouble and would have been immediately available
obtaining money at the savings bank would involve fresh risk
travis hesitated whether to take it or not but finally decided that it would be worth the trouble and hazard
he accordingly slipped the book into his pocket locked the drawer again and forgetting all about the handkerchief for which he had come home went downstairs and into the street
there would have been time to go to the savings bank that day but travis had already been absent from his place of business some time and did not venture to take the additional time required
besides not being very much used to savings banks never having had occasion to use them he thought it would be more prudent to look over the rules and regulations and see if he could not get some information as to the way he ought to proceed
so the day passed and dicks money was left in safety at the bank
in the evening it occurred to travis that it might be well to find out whether dick had discovered his loss
this reflection it was that induced the visit which is recorded at the close of the last chapter
the result was that he was misled by the boys silence on the subject and concluded that nothing had yet been discovered
good thought travis with satisfaction
if they dont find out for twentyfour hours itll be too late then and i shall be all right there being a possibility of the loss being discovered before the boys went out in the morning travis determined to see them at that time and judge whether such was the case
he waited therefore until he heard the boys come out and then opened his own door
morning gents said he sociably
going to business yes said dick
im afraid my clerksll be lazy if i aint on hand good joke said travis
if you pay good wages id like to speak for a place i pay all i get myself said dick
hows business with you so so
why dont you call round some time all my evenins is devoted to literatoor and science said dick
thank you all the same where do you hang out inquired travis in choice language addressing fosdick
at hendersons hat and cap store on broadway ill look in upon you some time when i want a tile said travis
i suppose you sell cheaper to your friends ill be as reasonable as i can said fosdick not very cordially for he did not much fancy having it supposed by his employer that such a disreputablelooking person as travis was a friend of his
however travis had no idea of showing himself at the broadway store and only said this by way of making conversation and encouraging the boys to be social
you havent any of you gents seen a pearlhandled knife have you he asked
no said fosdick have you lost one yes said travis with unblushing falsehood
i left it on my bureau a day or two since
ive missed one or two other little matters
bridget dont look to me any too honest
likely shes got em what are you goin to do about it said dick
ill keep mum unless i lose something more and then ill kick up a row and haul her over the coals
have you missed anything no said fosdick answering for himself as he could do without violating the truth
there was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of travis as he heard this
they havent found it out yet he thought
ill bag the money today and then they may whistle for it having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys he bade them goodmorning and turned down another street
hes mighty friendly all of a sudden said dick
yes said fosdick its very evident what it all means
he wants to find out whether you have discovered your loss or not but he didnt find out no weve put him on the wrong track
he means to get his money today no doubt my money suggested dick
i accept the correction said fosdick
of course dick youll be on hand as soon as the bank opens in course i shall
jim travisll find hes walked into the wrong shop the bank opens at ten oclock you know ill be there on time the two boys separated
good luck dick said fosdick as he parted from him
itll all come out right i think i hope twill said dick
he had recovered from his temporary depression and made up his mind that the money would be recovered
he had no idea of allowing himself to be outwitted by jim travis and enjoyed already in anticipation the pleasure of defeating his rascality
it wanted two hours and a half yet to ten oclock and this time to dick was too precious to be wasted
it was the time of his greatest harvest
he accordingly repaired to his usual place of business succeeded in obtaining six customers which yielded him sixty cents
he then went to a restaurant and got some breakfast
it was now halfpast nine and dick feeling that it wouldnt do to be late left his box in charge of johnny nolan and made his way to the bank
the officers had not yet arrived and dick lingered on the outside waiting till they should come
he was not without a little uneasiness fearing that travis might be as prompt as himself and finding him there might suspect something and so escape the snare
but though looking cautiously up and down the street he could discover no traces of the supposed thief
in due time ten oclock struck and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown open and our hero entered
as dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last nine months the cashier had come to know him by sight
youre early this morning my lad he said pleasantly
have you got some more money to deposit
youll be getting rich soon i dont know about that said dick
my bankbooks been stole stolen echoed the cashier
thats unfortunate
not so bad as it might be though
the thief cant collect the money thats what i came to see about said dick
i was afraid he might have got it already he hasnt been here yet
even if he had i remember you and should have detected him
when was it taken yesterday said dick
i missed it in the evenin when i got home have you any suspicion as to the person who took it asked the cashier
dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and suspicious conduct of jim travis and the cashier agreed with him that he was probably the thief
dick also gave his reason for thinking that he would visit the bank that morning to withdraw the funds
very good said the cashier
well be ready for him
what is the number of your book no
said dick
now give me a little description of this travis whom you suspect dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of travis not particularly complimentary to the latter
that will answer
i think i shall know him said the cashier
you may depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account thank you said dick
considerably relieved in mind our hero turned towards the door thinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer while he would of course lose time
he had just reached the doors which were of glass when through them he perceived james travis himself just crossing the street and apparently coming towards the bank
it would not do of course for him to be seen
here he is he exclaimed hurrying back
cant you hide me somewhere
i dont want to be seen the cashier understood at once how the land lay
he quickly opened a little door and admitted dick behind the counter
stoop down he said so as not to be seen dick had hardly done so when jim travis opened the outer door and looking about him in a little uncertainty walked up to the cashiers desk
travis is arrested jim travis advanced into the bank with a doubtful step knowing well that he was on a dishonest errand and heartily wishing that he were well out of it
after a little hesitation he approached the payingteller and exhibiting the bankbook said i want to get my money out the bankofficer took the book and after looking at it a moment said how much do you want the whole of it said travis
you can draw out any part of it but to draw out the whole requires a weeks notice then ill take a hundred dollars are you the person to whom the book belongs yes sir said travis without hesitation
your name is hunter the bankclerk went to a large folio volume containing the names of depositors and began to turn over the leaves
while he was doing this he managed to send out a young man connected with the bank for a policeman
travis did not perceive this or did not suspect that it had anything to do with himself
not being used to savings banks he supposed the delay only what was usual
after a search which was only intended to gain time that a policeman might be summoned the cashier came back and sliding out a piece of paper to travis said it will be necessary for you to write an order for the money travis took a pen which he found on the ledge outside and wrote the order signing his name dick hunter having observed that name on the outside of the book
your name is dick hunter then said the cashier taking the paper and looking at the thief over his spectacles
yes said travis promptly
but continued the cashier i find hunters age is put down on the bankbook as fourteen
surely you must be more than that travis would gladly have declared that he was only fourteen but being in reality twentythree and possessing a luxuriant pair of whiskers this was not to be thought of
he began to feel uneasy
dick hunters my younger brother he said
im getting out the money for him i thought you said your own name was dick hunter said the cashier
i said my name was hunter said travis ingeniously
i didnt understand you but youve signed the name of dick hunter to this order
how is that questioned the troublesome cashier
travis saw that he was getting himself into a tight place but his selfpossession did not desert him
i thought i must give my brothers name he answered
what is your own name henry hunter can you bring any one to testify that the statement you are making is correct yes a dozen if you like said travis boldly
give me the book and ill come back this afternoon
i didnt think thered be such a fuss about getting out a little money wait a moment
why dont your brother come himself because hes sick
hes down with the measles said travis
here the cashier signed to dick to rise and show himself
our hero accordingly did so
you will be glad to find that he has recovered said the cashier pointing to dick
with an exclamation of anger and dismay travis who saw the game was up started for the door feeling that safety made such a course prudent
but he was too late
he found himself confronted by a burly policeman who seized him by the arm saying not so fast my man
i want you let me go exclaimed travis struggling to free himself
im sorry i cant oblige you said the officer
youd better not make a fuss or i may have to hurt you a little travis sullenly resigned himself to his fate darting a look of rage at dick whom he considered the author of his present misfortune
this is your book said the cashier handing back his rightful property to our hero
do you wish to draw out any money two dollars said dick
very well
write an order for the amount before doing so dick who now that he saw travis in the power of the law began to pity him went up to the officer and said wont you let him go
ive got my bankbook back and i dont want anything done to him sorry i cant oblige you said the officer but im not allowed to do it
hell have to stand his trial im sorry for you travis said dick
i didnt want you arrested
i only wanted my bankbook back curse you said travis scowling vindictively
wait till i get free
see if i dont fix you you neednt pity him too much said the officer
i know him now
hes been to the island before its a lie said travis violently
dont be too noisy my friend said the officer
if youve got no more business here well be going he withdrew with the prisoner in charge and dick having drawn his two dollars left the bank
notwithstanding the violent words the prisoner had used towards himself and his attempted robbery he could not help feeling sorry that he had been instrumental in causing his arrest
ill keep my book a little safer hereafter thought dick
now i must go and see tom wilkins before dismissing the subject of travis and his theft it may be remarked that he was duly tried and his guilt being clear was sent to blackwells island for nine months
at the end of that time on his release he got a chance to work his passage on a ship to san francisco where he probably arrived in due time
at any rate nothing more has been heard of him and probably his threat of vengence against dick will never be carried into effect
returning to the city hall park dick soon fell in with tom wilkins
how are you tom he said
hows your mother shes better dick thank you
she felt worried about bein turned out into the street but i gave her that money from you and now she feels a good deal easier ive got some more for you tom said dick producing a twodollar bill from his pocket
i ought not to take it from you dick oh its all right tom
dont be afraid but you may need it yourself theres plenty more where that came from any way one dollar will be enough
with that we can pay the rent youll want the other to buy something to eat youre very kind dick id ought to be
ive only got myself to take care of well ill take it for my mothers sake
when you want anything done just call on tom wilkins all right
next week if your mother doesnt get better ill give you some more tom thanked our hero very gratefully and dick walked away feeling the selfapproval which always accompanies a generous and disinterested action
he was generous by nature and before the period at which he is introduced to the readers notice he frequently treated his friends to cigars and oysterstews
sometimes he invited them to accompany him to the theatre at his expense
but he never derived from these acts of liberality the same degree of satisfaction as from this timely gift to tom wilkins
he felt that his money was well bestowed and would save an entire family from privation and discomfort
five dollars would to be sure make something of a difference in the amount of his savings
it was more than he was able to save up in a week
but dick felt fully repaid for what he had done and he felt prepared to give as much more if toms mother should continue to be sick and should appear to him to need it
besides all this dick felt a justifiable pride in his financial ability to afford so handsome a gift
a year before however much he might have desired to give it would have been quite out of his power to give five dollars
his cash balance never reached that amount
it was seldom indeed that it equalled one dollar
in more ways than one dick was beginning to reap the advantage of his selfdenial and judicious economy
it will be remembered that when mr whitney at parting with dick presented him with five dollars he told him that he might repay it to some other boy who was struggling upward
dick thought of this and it occurred to him that after all he was only paying up an old debt
when fosdick came home in the evening dick announced his success in recovering his lost money and described the manner it had been brought about
youre in luck said fosdick
i guess wed better not trust the bureaudrawer again i mean to carry my book round with me said dick
so shall i as long as we stay at mrs mooneys
i wish we were in a better place i must go down and tell her she neednt expect travis back
poor chap i pity him travis was never more seen in mrs mooneys establishment
he was owing that lady for a fortnights rent of his room which prevented her feeling much compassion for him
the room was soon after let to a more creditable tenant who proved a less troublesome neighbor than his predecessor
dick receives a letter it was about a week after dicks recovery of his bankbook that fosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the daily sun would you like to see your name in print dick he asked
yes said dick who was busy at the washstand endeavoring to efface the marks which his days work had left upon his hands
they havent put me up for mayor have they
cause if they have i shant accept
it would interfere too much with my private business no said fosdick they havent put you up for office yet though that may happen sometime
but if you want to see your name in print here it is dick was rather incredulous but having dried his hands on the towel took the paper and following the directions of fosdicks finger observed in the list of advertised letters the name of ragged dick by gracious so it is said he
do you spose it means me i dont know of any other ragged dickdo you no said dick reflectively it must be me
but i dont know of anybody that would be likely to write to me perhaps it is frank whitney suggested fosdick after a little reflection
didnt he promise to write to you yes said dick and he wanted me to write to him where is he now he was going to a boardingschool in connecticut he said
the name of the town was barnton very likely the letter is from him i hope it is
frank was a tiptop boy and he was the first that made me ashamed of bein so ignorant and dirty you had better go to the postoffice tomorrow morning and ask for the letter praps they wont give it to me suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago when frank first saw you
they wont have any doubt of your being ragged dick then i guess i will
ill be sort of ashamed to be seen in em though said dick who had considerable more pride in a neat personal appearance than when we were first introduced to him
it will be only for one day or one morning said fosdick
id do moren that for the sake of gettin a letter from frank
id like to see him the next morning in accordance with the suggestion of fosdick dick arrayed himself in the long disused washington coat and napoleon pants which he had carefully preserved for what reason he could hardly explain
when fairly equipped dick surveyed himself in the mirrorif the little sevenbynineinch lookingglass with which the room was furnished deserved the name
the result of the survey was not on the whole a pleasing one
to tell the truth dick was quite ashamed of his appearance and on opening the chamberdoor looked around to see that the coast was clear not being willing to have any of his fellowboarders see him in his present attire
he managed to slip out into the street unobserved and after attending to two or three regular customers who came downtown early in the morning he made his way down nassau street to the postoffice
he passed along until he came to a compartment on which he read advertised letters and stepping up to the little window said theres a letter for me
i saw it advertised in the sun yesterday what name demanded the clerk
ragged dick answered our hero
thats a queer name said the clerk surveying him a little curiously
are you ragged dick if you dont believe me look at my cloes said dick
thats pretty good proof certainly said the clerk laughing
if that isnt your name it deserves to be i believe in dressin up to your name said dick
do you know any one in barnton connecticut asked the clerk who had by this time found the letter
yes said dick
i know a chap thats at boardinschool there it appears to be in a boys hand
i think it must be yours the letter was handed to dick through the window
he received it eagerly and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng who were constantly applying for letters or slipping them into the boxes provided for them hastily opened it and began to read
as the reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well as dick we transcribe it below
it was dated barnton conn and commenced thus dear dickyou must excuse my addressing this letter to ragged dick but the fact is i dont know what your last name is nor where you live
i am afraid there is not much chance of your getting this letter but i hope you will
i have thought of you very often and wondered how you were getting along and i should have written to you before if i had known where to direct
let me tell you a little about myself
barnton is a very pretty country town only about six miles from hartford
the boardingschool which i attend is under the charge of ezekiel munroe am
he is a man of about fifty a graduate of yale college and has always been a teacher
it is a large twostory house with an addition containing a good many small bedchambers for the boys
there are about twenty of us and there is one assistant teacher who teaches the english branches
mr munroe or old zeke as we call him behind his back teaches latin and greek
i am studying both these languages because father wants me to go to college
but you wont be interested in hearing about our studies
i will tell you how we amuse ourselves
there are about fifty acres of land belonging to mr munroe so that we have plenty of room for play
about a quarter of a mile from the house there is a goodsized pond
there is a large roundbottomed boat which is stout and strong
every wednesday and saturday afternoon when the weather is good we go out rowing on the pond
mr barton the assistant teacher goes with us to look after us
in the summer we are allowed to go in bathing
in the winter there is splendid skating on the pond
besides this we play ball a good deal and we have various other plays
so we have a pretty good time although we study pretty hard too
i am getting on very well in my studies
father has not decided yet where he will send me to college
i wish you were here dick
i should enjoy your company and besides i should like to feel that you were getting an education
i think you are naturally a pretty smart boy but i suppose as you have to earn your own living you dont get much chance to learn
i only wish i had a few hundred dollars of my own
i would have you come up here and attend school with us
if i ever have a chance to help you in any way you may be sure that i will
i shall have to wind up my letter now as i have to hand in a composition tomorrow on the life and character of washington
i might say that i have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged to the general
but i suppose that coat must be worn out by this time
i dont much like writing compositions
i would a good deal rather write letters
i have written a longer letter than i meant to
i hope you will get it though i am afraid not
if you do you must be sure to answer it as soon as possible
you neednt mind if your writing does look like henstracks as you told me once
goodby dick
you must always think of me as your very true friend frank whitney dick read this letter with much satisfaction
it is always pleasant to be remembered and dick had so few friends that it was more to him than to boys who are better provided
again he felt a new sense of importance in having a letter addressed to him
it was the first letter he had ever received
if it had been sent to him a year before he would not have been able to read it
but now thanks to fosdicks instructions he could not only read writing but he could write a very good hand himself
there was one passage in the letter which pleased dick
it was where frank said that if he had the money he would pay for his education himself
hes a tiptop feller said dick
i wish i could see him agin there were two reasons why dick would like to have seen frank
one was the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend but he felt also that he would like to have frank witness the improvement he had made in his studies and mode of life
hed find me a little more spectable than when he first saw me thought dick
dick had by this time got up to printing house square
standing on spruce street near the tribune office was his old enemy micky maguire
it has already been said that micky felt a natural enmity towards those in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than himself
for the last nine months dicks neat appearance had excited the ire of the young philistine
to appear in neat attire and with a clean face micky felt was a piece of presumption and an assumption of superiority on the part of our hero and he termed it tryin to be a swell now his astonished eyes rested on dick in his ancient attire which was very similar to his own
it was a moment of triumph to him
he felt that pride had had a fall and he could not forbear reminding dick of it
thems nice cloes youve got on said he sarcastically as dick came up
yes said dick promptly
ive been employin your tailor
if my face was only dirty wed be taken for twin brothers so youve give up tryin to be a swell only for this particlar occasion said dick
i wanted to make a fashionable call so i put on my regimentals i dont blieve youve got any better cloes said micky
all right said dick i wont charge you nothin for what you believe here a customer presented himself for micky and dick went back to his room to change his clothes before resuming business
dick writes his first letter when fosdick reached home in the evening dick displayed his letter with some pride
its a nice letter said fosdick after reading it
i should like to know frank ill bet you would said dick
hes a trump when are you going to answer it i dont know said dick dubiously
i never writ a letter thats no reason why you shouldnt
theres always a first time you know i dont know what to say said dick
get some paper and sit down to it and youll find enough to say
you can do that this evening instead of studying if youll look it over afterwards and shine it up a little yes if it needs it but i rather think frank would like it best just as you wrote it dick decided to adopt fosdicks suggestion
he had very serious doubts as to his ability to write a letter
like a good many other boys he looked upon it as a very serious job not reflecting that after all letterwriting is nothing but talking upon paper
still in spite of his misgivings he felt that the letter ought to be answered and he wished frank to hear from him
after various preparations he at last got settled down to his task and before the evening was over a letter was written
as the first letter which dick had ever produced and because it was characteristic of him my readers may like to read it
here it is dear franki got your letter this mornin and was very glad to hear you hadnt forgotten ragged dick
i aint so ragged as i was
openwork coats and trowsers has gone out of fashion
i put on the washington coat and napoleon pants to go to the postoffice for fear they wouldnt think i was the boy that was meant
on my way back i received the congratulations of my intimate friend micky maguire on my improved appearance
ive give up sleepin in boxes and old wagons findin it didnt agree with my constitution
ive hired a room in mott street and have got a private tooter who rooms with me and looks after my studies in the evenin
mott street aint very fashionable but my manshun on fifth avenoo isnt finished yet and im afraid it wont be till im a grayhaired veteran
ive got a hundred dollars towards it which ive saved up from my earnins
i havent forgot what you and your uncle said to me and im tryin to grow up spectable
i havent been to tony pastors or the old bowery for ever so long
id rather save up my money to support me in my old age
when my hair gets gray im goin to knock off blackin boots and go into some light genteel employment such as keepin an applestand or disseminatin peanuts among the people
ive got so as to read pretty well so my tooter says
ive been studyin geography and grammar also
ive made such astonishin progress that i can tell a noun from a conjunction as far away as i can see em
tell mr munroe that if he wants an accomplished teacher in his school he can send for me and ill come on by the very next train
or if he wants to sell out for a hundred dollars ill buy the whole concern and agree to teach the scholars all i know myself in less than six months
is teachin as good business generally speakin as blackin boots
my private tooter combines both and is makin a fortun with great rapidity
hell be as rich as astor some time if he only lives long enough i should think youd have a bully time at your school
i should like to go out in the boat or play ball with you
when are you comin to the city
i wish youd write and let me know when you do and ill call and see you
ill leave my business in the hands of my numerous clerks and go round with you
theres lots of things you didnt see when you was here before
theyre getting on fast at the central park
it looks better than it did a year ago
i aint much used to writin letters
as this is the first one i ever wrote i hope youll excuse the mistakes
i hope youll write to me again soon
i cant write so good a letter as you but ill do my best as the man said when he was asked if he could swim over to brooklyn backwards
goodby frank
thank you for all your kindness
direct your next letter to no
mott street
your true friend dick hunter when dick had written the last word he leaned back in his chair and surveyed the letter with much satisfaction
i didnt think i could have wrote such a long letter fosdick said he
written would be more grammatical dick suggested his friend
i guess theres plenty of mistakes in it said dick
just look at it and see fosdick took the letter and read it over carefully
yes there are some mistakes he said but it sounds so much like you that i think it would be better to let it go just as it is
it will be more likely to remind frank of what you were when he first saw you is it good enough to send asked dick anxiously
yes it seems to me to be quite a good letter
it is written just as you talk
nobody but you could have written such a letter dick
i think frank will be amused at your proposal to come up there as teacher praps it would be a good idea for us to open a seleck school here in mott street said dick humorously
we could call it professor fosdick and hunters mott street seminary bootblackin taught by professor hunter the evening was so far advanced that dick decided to postpone copying his letter till the next evening
by this time he had come to have a very fair handwriting so that when the letter was complete it really looked quite creditable and no one would have suspected that it was dicks first attempt in this line
our hero surveyed it with no little complacency
in fact he felt rather proud of it since it reminded him of the great progress he had made
he carried it down to the postoffice and deposited it with his own hands in the proper box
just on the steps of the building as he was coming out he met johnny nolan who had been sent on an errand to wall street by some gentleman and was just returning
what are you doin down here dick asked johnny
ive been mailin a letter who sent you nobody i mean who writ the letter i wrote it myself can you write letters asked johnny in amazement
why shouldnt i i didnt know you could write
i cant then you ought to learn i went to school once but it was too hard work so i give it up youre lazy johnnythats whats the matter
howd you ever expect to know anything if you dont try i cant learn you can if you want to johnny nolan was evidently of a different opinion
he was a goodnatured boy large of his age with nothing particularly bad about him but utterly lacking in that energy ambition and natural sharpness for which dick was distinguished
he was not adapted to succeed in the life which circumstances had forced upon him for in the streetlife of the metropolis a boy needs to be on the alert and have all his wits about him or he will find himself wholly distanced by his more enterprising competitors for popular favor
to succeed in his profession humble as it is a bootblack must depend upon the same qualities which gain success in higher walks in life
it was easy to see that johnny unless very much favored by circumstances would never rise much above his present level
for dick we cannot help hoping much better things
an exciting adventure dick now began to look about for a position in a store or countingroom
until he should obtain one he determined to devote half the day to blacking boots not being willing to break in upon his small capital
he found that he could earn enough in half a day to pay all his necessary expenses including the entire rent of the room
fosdick desired to pay his half but dick steadily refused insisting upon paying so much as compensation for his friends services as instructor
it should be added that dicks peculiar way of speaking and use of slang terms had been somewhat modified by his education and his intimacy with henry fosdick
still he continued to indulge in them to some extent especially when he felt like joking and it was natural to dick to joke as my readers have probably found out by this time
still his manners were considerably improved so that he was more likely to obtain a situation than when first introduced to our notice
just now however business was very dull and merchants instead of hiring new assistants were disposed to part with those already in their employ
after making several ineffectual applications dick began to think he should be obliged to stick to his profession until the next season
but about this time something occurred which considerably improved his chances of preferment
this is the way it happened
as dick with a balance of more than a hundred dollars in the savings bank might fairly consider himself a young man of property he thought himself justified in occasionally taking a half holiday from business and going on an excursion
on wednesday afternoon henry fosdick was sent by his employer on an errand to that part of brooklyn near greenwood cemetery
dick hastily dressed himself in his best and determined to accompany him
the two boys walked down to the south ferry and paying their two cents each entered the ferry boat
they remained at the stern and stood by the railing watching the great city with its crowded wharves receding from view
beside them was a gentleman with two childrena girl of eight and a little boy of six
the children were talking gayly to their father
while he was pointing out some object of interest to the little girl the boy managed to creep unobserved beneath the chain that extends across the boat for the protection of passengers and stepping incautiously to the edge of the boat fell over into the foaming water
at the childs scream the father looked up and with a cry of horror sprang to the edge of the boat
he would have plunged in but being unable to swim would only have endangered his own life without being able to save his child
my child he exclaimed in anguishwho will save my child
a thousandten thousand dollars to any one who will save him there chanced to be but few passengers on board at the time and nearly all these were either in the cabins or standing forward
among the few who saw the child fall was our hero
now dick was an expert swimmer
it was an accomplishment which he had possessed for years and he no sooner saw the boy fall than he resolved to rescue him
his determination was formed before he heard the liberal offer made by the boys father
indeed i must do dick the justice to say that in the excitement of the moment he did not hear it at all nor would it have stimulated the alacrity with which he sprang to the rescue of the little boy
little johnny had already risen once and gone under for the second time when our hero plunged in
he was obliged to strike out for the boy and this took time
he reached him none too soon
just as he was sinking for the third and last time he caught him by the jacket
dick was stout and strong but johnny clung to him so tightly that it was with great difficulty he was able to sustain himself
put your arms round my neck said dick
the little boy mechanically obeyed and clung with a grasp strengthened by his terror
in this position dick could bear his weight better
but the ferryboat was receding fast
it was quite impossible to reach it
the father his face pale with terror and anguish and his hands clasped in suspense saw the brave boys struggles and prayed with agonizing fervor that he might be successful
but it is probable for they were now midway of the river that both dick and the little boy whom he had bravely undertaken to rescue would have been drowned had not a rowboat been fortunately near
the two men who were in it witnessed the accident and hastened to the rescue of our hero
keep up a little longer they shouted bending to their oars and we will save you dick heard the shout and it put fresh strength into him
he battled manfully with the treacherous sea his eyes fixed longingly upon the approaching boat
hold on tight little boy he said
theres a boat coming the little boy did not see the boat
his eyes were closed to shut out the fearful water but he clung the closer to his young preserver
six long steady strokes and the boat dashed along side
strong hands seized dick and his youthful burden and drew them into the boat both dripping with water
god be thanked exclaimed the father as from the steamer he saw the childs rescue
that brave boy shall be rewarded if i sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it youve had a pretty narrow escape young chap said one of the boatmen to dick
it was a pretty tough job you undertook yes said dick
thats what i thought when i was in the water
if it hadnt been for you i dont know what would have come of us anyhow youre a plucky boy or you wouldnt have dared to jump into the water after this little chap
it was a risky thing to do im used to the water said dick modestly
i didnt stop to think of the danger but i wasnt going to see that little fellow drown without tryin to save him the boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the brooklyn side
the captain of the ferryboat seeing the rescue did not think it necessary to stop his boat but kept on his way
the whole occurrence took place in less time than i have occupied in telling it
the father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy with what feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood
with a burst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms
dick was about to withdraw modestly but the gentleman perceived the movement and putting down the child came forward and clasping his hand said with emotion my brave boy i owe you a debt i can never repay
but for your timely service i should now be plunged into an anguish which i cannot think of without a shudder our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions but always felt awkward when he was praised
it wasnt any trouble he said modestly
i can swim like a top but not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger said the gentleman
but he added with a sudden thought as his glance rested on dicks dripping garments both you and my little boy will take cold in wet clothes
fortunately i have a friend living close at hand at whose house you will have an opportunity of taking off your clothes and having them dried dick protested that he never took cold but fosdick who had now joined them and who it is needless to say had been greatly alarmed at dicks danger joined in urging compliance with the gentlemans proposal and in the end our hero had to yield
his new friend secured a hack the driver of which agreed for extra recompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage and they were whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street where matters were quickly explained and both boys were put to bed
i aint used to goin to bed quite so early thought dick
this is the queerest excursion i ever took like most active boys dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending half a day in bed but his confinement did not last as long as he anticipated
in about an hour the door of his chamber was opened and a servant appeared bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout
you are to put on these said the servant to dick but you neednt get up till you feel like it whose clothes are they asked dick
they are yours mine
where did they come from mr
rockwell sent out and bought them for you
they are the same size as your wet ones is he here now no
he bought another suit for the little boy and has gone back to new york
heres a note he asked me to give you dick opened the paper and read as follows please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of a debt which i can never repay
i have asked to have your wet suit dried when you can reclaim it
will you oblige me by calling tomorrow at my counting room no
pearl street
your friend james rockwell conclusion when dick was dressed in his new suit he surveyed his figure with pardonable complacency
it was the best he had ever worn and fitted him as well as if it had been made expressly for him
hes done the handsome thing said dick to himself but there wasnt no casion for his givin me these clothes
my lucky stars are shinin pretty bright now
jumpin into the water pays better than shinin boots but i dont think id like to try it moren once a week about eleven oclock the next morning dick repaired to mr rockwells countingroom on pearl street
he found himself in front of a large and handsome warehouse
the countingroom was on the lower floor
our hero entered and found mr rockwell sitting at a desk
no sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose and advancing shook dick by the hand in the most friendly manner
my young friend he said you have done me so great service that i wish to be of some service to you in return
tell me about yourself and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future dick frankly related his past history and told mr rockwell of his desire to get into a store or countingroom and of the failure of all his applications thus far
the merchant listened attentively to dicks statement and when he had finished placed a sheet of paper before him and handing him a pen said will you write your name on this piece of paper dick wrote in a free bold hand the name richard hunter
he had very much improved in his penmanship as has already been mentioned and now had no cause to be ashamed of it
mr rockwell surveyed it approvingly
how would you like to enter my countingroom as clerk richard he asked
dick was about to say bully when he recollected himself and answered very much i suppose you know something of arithmetic do you not yes sir then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a week
you may come next monday morning ten dollars repeated dick thinking he must have misunderstood
yes will that be sufficient its more than i can earn said dick honestly
perhaps it is at first said mr rockwell smiling but i am willing to pay you that
i will besides advance you as fast as your progress will justify it dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some demonstration which would have astonished the merchant but he exercised selfcontrol and only said ill try to serve you so faithfully sir that you wont repent having taken me into your service and i think you will succeed said mr rockwell encouragingly
i will not detain you any longer for i have some important business to attend to
i shall expect to see you on monday morning dick left the countingroom hardly knowing whether he stood on his head or his heels so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his fortunes
ten dollars a week was to him a fortune and three times as much as he had expected to obtain at first
indeed he would have been glad only the day before to get a place at three dollars a week
he reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now on hand he could save up at least half of it and even then live better than he had been accustomed to do so that his little fund in the savings bank instead of being diminished would be steadily increasing
then he was to be advanced if he deserved it
it was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who only a year before could neither read nor write and depended for a nights lodging upon the chance hospitality of an alleyway or old wagon
dicks great ambition to grow up spectable seemed likely to be accomplished after all
i wish fosdick was as well off as i am he thought generously
but he determined to help his less fortunate friend and assist him up the ladder as he advanced himself
when dick entered his room on mott street he discovered that some one else had been there before him and two articles of wearing apparel had disappeared
by gracious he exclaimed somebodys stole my washington coat and napoleon pants
maybe its an agent of barnums who expects to make a fortun by exhibitin the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman of fashion dick did not shed many tears over his loss as in his present circumstances he never expected to have any further use for the wellworn garments
it may be stated that he afterwards saw them adorning the figure of micky maguire but whether that estimable young man stole them himself he never ascertained
as to the loss dick was rather pleased that it had occurred
it seemed to cut him off from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume
henceforward he meant to press onward and rise as high as possible
although it was yet only noon dick did not go out again with his brush
he felt that it was time to retire from business
he would leave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate than himself
that evening dick and fosdick had a long conversation
fosdick rejoiced heartily in his friends success and on his side had the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced to six dollars a week
i think we can afford to leave mott street now he continued
this house isnt as neat as it might be and i shall like to live in a nicer quarter of the city all right said dick
well hunt up a new room tomorrow
i shall have plenty of time having retired from business
ill try to get my reglar customers to take johnny nolan in my place
that boy hasnt any enterprise
he needs some body to look out for him you might give him your box and brush too dick no said dick ill give him some new ones but mine i want to keep to remind me of the hard times ive had when i was an ignorant bootblack and never expected to be anything better when in short you were ragged dick you must drop that name and think of yourself now as richard hunter esq said our hero smiling
a young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune added fosdick
here ends the story of ragged dick
as fosdick said he is ragged dick no longer
he has taken a step upward and is determined to mount still higher
there are fresh adventures in store for him and for others who have been introduced in these pages
those who have felt interested in his early life will find his history continued in a new volume forming the second of the series to be called fame and fortune or the progress of richard hunter
